 recognize your right to exist, to vote, to speak, to do anything they have not commanded you to do in their own interests. They are tyrants with no redeeming value, and they have zero worth in this country any longer.\n\nThis seems a bit hyperbolic.  But unlike similar claims from the Right about the Left, yours does have a basic in reality.\n\nThere is no argument from me: The Republicans are the new Communists, where ideology & power matter more than facts, fairness, or the country itself.
weirdo^^

Conservative here - let's take a step back for a second and be reasonable. I know we probably don't agree on much, but we both want to do what we think is best for the country. That should be the driving force behind discussion of issues, figuring out what problems need to be solved and how to go about it. But when it comes to cooperating and listening to each other, calling us Nazis doesn't help, so I ask you who is really impeding cooperation here. \n\nIf you think the alt right represents the modern conservative movement, then I could make an equivalent statement that Anti-fa represents liberals. Both statements are BS. We can get along but don't pretend the left isn't any less guilty than the right for the current state of public discourse.\n\n
I expect a continually degenerating one-party state. As you said of the Dems, "they were cooperating with these lawless pigs" and will continue to. If the R finally turn on Trump, the 2 parties might as well merge and enjoy their forever war of capital against the world. It will take a workers' movement stronger than the D party to break the idea that it's fine for a few people to own everything.
So you were going to gibber incoherently, but decided being inane was more efficient.  \n\nThe electrons that were spared being part of your comment thank you for your compassion.

Oh well that sucks. \n\nSo, any thoughts on how many votes Latin American farmers should have in your unconstitutional voting schema?
that's the method that's been tried since 1981, and that's why democrats are where they are today. As long as Fox news exists, as long as the Heritage Foundation pours millions and millions into "think tanks" that generate right wing (and increasingly fascist) talking points/narratives that becomes national discussion, and as long as people are ill educated enough to lack the capacity for critical thought---there's no way we can win against the right wing. \n\nthis sort of sentiment would have been very effective 20 years ago. The DNC is just as compromised as the RNC--they don't reflect the will of the people, unless their corporate masters allow them to. As long as nobody on the democratic side is willing to address the influence of corporate interests on the Democratic party, we will continue to run on this same hamster wheel of thought. \n

Yes I did! Hah
Screw it - I'll bite: what matters most in your schema?
Let's face it, they're a bunch of arrogant, greedy, assholes and it's time to take the "PC" treatment of the right and shove it down the shitter. I am exhausted from years of tolerating their beliefs while they refused anyone else theirs. I am tired of listening to how they think they're more moral than everyone else whilst they prey on the poor and discriminate against everyone but themselves. I am sick to death of their whining that the news revealing their lies and crimes is all fake while they shove fake news down America's throat on FOX and Breitbart and whatever other right-wing filth pits their propaganda comes from. It's time to shut these people up and shut their agenda down.
The one mistake Pres. O made was believing republicans would compromise.
Well I started to say it was more demo-drivel from the pathetic loony left but felt no need to haha
"Ladies and gentlemen, there is no Republican Party. There is no group of political ideas with that label any longer."\n\nI think parts of the GOP are starting to realize this, honestly. Part of me hopes that Trump's presidency can be a case of the kid touching the hot pan, and that conservatives burning their hand will be a little more open to cooperation.\n\nAs of right now, that's certainly not the case. But who knows what will happen if Trump's presidency comes crashing down on them.
> Now you say conservatism is "a runaway train to atrocity" what specifically are you talking about?\n\nI refer to the process of radicalization that's been unfolding since the 1960s with the Birchers, Ronald Reagan, right-wing Hate Radio, Gingrich, Fox News, Bush's insanity (which seems in retrospect like just a more reasonable prototype for Trump's), the Tea Party, etc.  \n\nEvery year, people who are *less* responsible, *less* rational, *less* interested in serving the country rather than themselves and pursuing ideological vendettas against scapegoats become more and more the faces of conservatism.\n\n> And I'm not sure how you managed to convince yourself conservatives lost the civil war, it was the democrats leading the south at the time.\n\nDemocrats were the Southern conservative party of the time.  Republicans were Northern liberals.  The parties switched sides ideologically over the ensuing century.  Surely you knew that?  It's not some obscure historical piece of trivia - it's the overwhelming fact of the subject.\n\n> Does the name George Soros mean anything to you?\n\nNo, it doesn't.  At all.  He means a lot more to your side than mine.  He's one of several Emmanuel Goldsteins the right-wing uses to pretend that there is anything like their mentality among us, when there simply isn't.\n\n>  If you look at donations to the Clinton foundation we see money coming from middle eastern governments like Saudi Arabia.\n\nYes, they donated to her charity, not her campaign.  And they sure as hell didn't hack the GOP's servers and then try to take over the internet with a massive spam and trolling campaign that lasted for months and turned the internet into a totalitarian  propaganda nightmare like Russia did for Trump.  And let's not forget James Comey's little putsch.\n\nThere were stretches of weeks at a time where Russian government employees were dictating the contents of Reddit, zeroing out every post against Trump or for Clinton and doing the opposite for vice-versa, spamming ridiculous boilerplate comments to fuck with everybody and spread Fake News.\n\nIt was a massive and clearly long-planned operation, and Western intelligence agencies have been screaming about it ever since.\n\nIt was essentially a coup.  The only reason it wasn't an act of war on Russia's part was that the information they stole was stolen electronically rather than involving a physical burglary - which is a trivial distinction, frankly, given the consequences.\n\n> This is not true in the slightest, I don't know a single person, conservative or liberal that believes this.\n\nSo you are unaware of Trump's people saying things like that "facts don't exist," "listen to the President to know what's true," "it's not illegal if the President does it," denying science and making shit up whenever facts don't suit them, and other things that deny ideas going back to the Enlightenment centuries ago?\n\nSteve Bannon publicly calling our constitutional republic with three branches of government "obsolete" and saying they are intent on destroying it?  *Bragging* as much?
The conservatives in this country are, at this moment, enabling a fascist regime just so they can get their way on a few things they've always wanted. They are selling out our republic and our constitution for power. What about Trump is "conservative?" Nothing. And I say that as a life long Republican. 2016 was the first time I voted for a Democrat for anything, ANYTHING, from dog-catcher to president. I don't agree with the OP; the Republican Party used to be a party of principles, of lettered men and women who wanted to make the county a better place the way they saw it. A party that, along with our Democratic friends, actually believed in the constitution, not just their favorite parts while paying lip service to or ignoring the rest. \n\nI lament the fact that the party I was a member of for so long has been hijacked by a group of amoral fascists led by a narcissistic psychopath. Trump's daily actions are chipping away at the very foundations of our government and the American republic. All patriotic Americans should be opposing his blatant disregard of democratic institutions and norms, his attempts to silence the press, the judiciary, and everyone who disagrees with him. The republicans have sold out our country and, if we ever have free and fair elections again, I will never vote for another person with an (R) beside their name. Not after what they've allowed to happen to my country. With their actions and inactions, they have proven that they don't care about us, our constitution, or our country; they only care about their own power.\n\nI don't agree with the democrats on everything, but belief in and adherence to our constitution and our democratic republic are bigger than ideology to me. The Republican Party is now the party of authoritarianism and that is something I will never vote for.
The only way Republicans will work with us if there are consequences when they don't.\n\nSo far there haven't been.  We cooperate with them when we win, we cooperate with them when we lose, and they cooperate with us...never.  Not fucking ever.\n\nTheir fundraising base had to be eviscerated with investigations into corrupt contractors and Nazi sympathizers before they became even halfway trustworthy in WW2, and that was in a state of declared war on *two* fronts, one of them against a *superior* enemy.\n\nThese people are a bunch of Gollum clones who only behave decently on a leash like Smeagol.
We have to challenge the right on every front without asking or expecting our existing institutions to do it for us. 
This sub is not a daycare, sport.
The eternal vulnerability of the decent.  \n\nLet's make it count, what he showed us.  He had to give them the chance.  And now there are no more chances left to give.\n\nThey are incorrigible and un-American.
> know we probably don't agree on much, but we both want to do what we think is best for the country.\n\nI hope that your actions are as fair as your words.  If so, then we can work with *you* as an individual.  But the general phenomenon that *calls itself* "conservatism" in this country (despite its increasing radicalism) has been psychopathic for several decades now, and if you believe what you say, then you have seen that happen and are equally concerned about it.\n\n> That should be the driving force behind discussion of issues, figuring out what problems need to be solved and how to go about it.\n\nWe never stopped doing that.  Republicans tuned out and drifted off into their own little pocket universe starting with talk radio shows in the '80s and '90s, Fox News in the '00s, and the present circumstances are a direct continuation of their dissent into fascist psychosis.\n\nIf you deny it, you are a part of it.  We will continue to believe our "lying eyes."\n\n>  But when it comes to cooperating and listening to each other, calling us Nazis doesn't help\n\nIf you are not one of the people who have turned to fascism, then you know the accusation in general is legitimate and should be making it yourself to protect your politics from the influences of people who will destroy this country.  Chaos does not respect the people who created it - it is an equal-opportunity destroyer.\n\n**So get on board the reality train or get off the tracks.**\n\n> If you think the alt right represents the modern conservative movement, then I could make an equivalent statement that Anti-fa represents liberals. \n\nAntifa kids aren't in control of America's military and nuclear arsenal.  Steve Bannon is on the National Security Council, and the Trazi crazies in the West Kremlin (excuse me, *White House*) use Breitbart as a source of information while dismissing NATO, the CIA, and the Department of Defense.  \n\nAnd frankly it's a false equivalency - they punch Nazis while Nazis openly fantasize about ethnic cleansing and/or genocide.  False equivalency and falsehood in general are part of what I'm talking about.  \n\nWe don't merely disagree on policy - you seem to have warped ideas about basic morality, treating Antifascists as some kind of mirror image of Fascists.  They're people who foolishly think punching skinheads will head off having to fight them in war some day.\n\n> We can get along but don't pretend the left isn't any less guilty than the right for the current state of public discourse.\n\nI don't pretend at all - I state it as an absolute and undeniable fact.  The left in the United States is utterly morally immaculate compared to the right.  It is the Virgin Mary's breast milk filtered through a Gandhi speech and sprinkled with MLK dust compared to the right.  The right just gets crazier and more evil with every passing year, and the moral dichotomy is approaching WW2 proportions.\n\n*That* is why we compare the right to Nazism.  Because it has become Nazism, in its early incarnations as lying thugs trying to create a dictatorship while dismantling a republic.  Steve Bannon just as much as publicly stated that to be his intention, calling our democracy, rule of law, and three-branch government 'obsolete'.\n\nThe choice is on *you*.  Continue to promulgate these laughable false equivalencies in the face of immediate facts and it will be clear you choose to serve liars.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n
Yes.  Perfect slogan: "Be America."  
Perez still wants to make it about not-Trump instead of for-the people, that's not gonna cut it
Mmmm, tastes like swamp
Ask and ye shall receive
Ah yes, because 'when they go low, we go high' worked out so well last time?
Mommy told *somebody* no more Xbox too early, huh?
I have plenty of hope of common ground with *you*.  You have actually made an effort here, and that's why I answered so extensively - I wanted to cover the bases.\n\nIt's the general phenomenon of right-wing politics in America that is a runaway train to atrocity.  The overall manifestation of it has gone beyond rational expectation of rejoining the fold of civilized discourse.\n\nThey have lied and denied themselves into an accountability-free alternate universe, living inside the narcissist delusions of a handful of Texas oil billionaires from half a century ago as if they were reality, and are now approaching a pre-genocidal boil.\n\nYou want things to be one way, but they're another.  What a person does when confronted by that is what defines their honesty - not how comfortable they are saying what they already believe.\n\nI've always wanted politics to be an amiable and constructive discussion, but what I found was that some people see that preference as weakness.  And those people are always - *always*, in my experience - conservatives.  \n\nThose who are conservative and consider themselves honest should explore what that's about, where that comes from, and find a way to defeat it in themselves.\n\nWe on the left have our own demons.  The desire for revenge against the inhuman crimes of the right poisoned the left globally in the 20th century.  We got over it, but the right never gets over anything.  It's still enraged at losing the Civil War, still enraged that women aren't their property, still enraged about every single iota of progress made since the Magna Carta.  \n\nAnd it's insane.  Simply, merely insane.\n\nSo, if you don't share in that mentality, then as a reasonable conservative you are an island of reason surrounded by an ocean of madness, and I don't envy the work ahead of you to either cross that ocean or drain it.

> I call myself a conservative because I agree with fiscal conservative policy, specifically lower taxes and less government intervention. \n\nLower/less than what?  Why is the *amount* the central focus of your politics rather than the priorities guiding its use?\n\n> I don't like the federal government having as much reach as it currently does.\n \nWhat is "reach"?  These are nebulous ideological concepts that are not based on actual behavior.  \n\nA government can be ubiquitous in daily life, and yet the citizenry may have a strong voice in what it does - as is common in Northern Europe.  Conversely, a government can be a petty dictatorship that totally ignores 99.9% of its people as they starve to death in the streets, and only interferes with its citizens when they try to organize a revolt - the proverbial banana republic.\n\n> My opinion on this has always been that individual states are too unique in the problems they face for the federal government to legislate effective solutions to these problems in a nation wide fashion.\n\nI support the existence of states, but they must all be free republics with equal rights.  That much is a matter of Constitutional mandate.  Many are *clearly* not free republics with anything even resembling equal rights, and allowing them to continue like that just destroys the social fabric that unifies our nation and introduces toxic third-world phenomena.  \n\nClearly strong intervention is required in these states to bring them up to par with American standards, or else there is no America and we are just talking Confederation - a position I cannot support.\n\n> Radical conservatism has only just cropped up into the public discourse, it take the name alt-right today.\n\nActually it started decades ago with the John Birch Society, and grew with the support of a cabal of Texas oil billlionaires.  They were ultimately instrumental in getting Ronald Reagan (an extremist) elected, and used their money to establish vast propaganda monopolies on talk radio that further radicalized the far right.  \n\nThe resulting fascist subculture is an alliance of mind-bogglingly greedy businessmen (of whom Donald Trump is the most Satanic example yet), bigoted religious fanatics (Pence is their representative in the occupying regime), and fascists who regard democracy and liberty as decadent nonsense holding them back from their "rightful place" in power (Bannon et al).\n\n> 'i don't agree with what you say, but I'll die to protect you're right to say it'. \n\nI hold to that value, but I hold to it in all directions.  If the "opinion" X is expressing is that they want to round up Y's entire ethnic group and exterminate them, X is using their right to threaten someone else's.  The balance of my obligation in that situation is clear.  I support their right to speak their crazy-ass mind - if only for the value of showing them for what they are - but the priority in that situation is clearly to defend Y from the threat to their freedom.  Which would, in part, include persuading them not to harm X for talking like a maniac.\n\nThis is the advice I give antifa people: Defending the weak is not the same thing as attacking those who attack the weak.  Lions eat hyenas, but that doesn't make lions defenders of animals that hyenas prey on - lions prey on them too.  A lion looks cool, and so does the idea of being an antifascist warrior, but reality is less impressive.  The actual Nazis got their asses kicked in the streets constantly by Communists and it didn't stop them.  \n\n> Today, it is far more common to see leftists calling for censorship of opinions they disagree with. \n\nNo, it isn't.  At all.  First of all, there actually was a radical left in the 20th century.  It was called Communism, and they expressed their discontent with fascist opinion with AK-47s, not social media complaints.  There were left-wing terrorist groups all over the world who murdered corporate executives and blew up conservative newspaper offices.  They were enraged and completely batshit crazy.\n\nMeanwhile in "polite" society, the issue didn't even come up because professional TV and radio stations had standards and practices that wouldn't allow them to indulge whackos just to stir up more viewers.  Only if an extremist had already achieved a degree of notoriety outside of the media would journalists then take note, rather than deliberately *creating* the phenomenon (as satirized in the movie "Network").\n\nYou are freer to express yourself than any ordinary person has ever been in this country.  The problem is that when people abandon *self*-control, they also abdicate any claim them have on demanding that others practice it when opposing them.  The "Hate Radio" phenomenon that started in the '80s by the radical right as part of the Reagan revolution completely took over and destroyed what remained of conservative rationality and accountability.\n\nLiberals win arguments because we're right, and that's all there is to it.  You can disagree about degrees, but fundamentally we are right and all honest processes of constructive discussion eventually settle on ideas that are on the liberal spectrum.  But some people have personalities that aren't interested in what is or isn't true, and don't believe in right vs. wrong - they are selfish to an absolute extreme, and they believe whatever it is that strokes their ego most, or justifies their prejudices, or rationalizes their failures in life.\n\nThose people are now the ideological and "intellectual" heart of American conservatism:   Nihilists who have abandoned all reason and moral constraint because all roads that involve them lead ultimately to ideas they hate, and they cherish that hatred more than anything - more than giving their children a future. \n\nDo you know those true crime cases where "ordinary family men" lose their job, lie to their family about it, and then one day just kill their entire family and themselves?  As far as the stories I've ever read about, those people are always conservatives.  Haven't seen a single example where it wasn't.  Which is not to say that behavior is characteristic of conservatives, but it illustrates what conservatism comes from - selfishness.  Much stronger awareness of and concern for one's own vanity than the well-being and autonomous rights of others.\n\n> If you genuinely view the right with that much contempt then I see no hope of coming to any sort of common ground with you. \n\nIf your words are sincere, then we already have identified common ground.  But that doesn't change the fact of the overall phenomena of left vs right in America.  The *American* left is morally immaculate compared to the right.  \n\nThe right brought slavery to this country, forced its inclusion in the Constitution, fought the expansion of the franchise at every...single...step of the way (non-landowners, blacks, Hispanics, women), supported breaking Indian treaties, seceded from the nation to keep slavery, killed hundreds of thousands of fellow Americans because they hated black people so much, supported Mussolini and Hitler until that became politically untenable, pursued Red Scare witch-hunts, fought against desegregation, fought *against* the Free Speech movement, waged terrorist campaigns in the South against Civil Rights marchers, assassinated Civil Rights leaders, schooled Central American dictators in torture and mass-murder, overthrew the elected government of Chile, smashed labor unions and closed hospitals, flooded the streets with guns, demand sadistic punishments for petty crimes, started the Iraq War that killed 5,000 Americans and a million Iraqis...just on, and on, and on.\n\nThere is no bottom to the phenomenon you choose to associate with, and that makes me skeptical about your ability to perceive the nature of those around you.  \n\n> Funny, I can say the same about the left\n\nHalf the time the right mocks the left as a bunch of frivolous Portlandia characters obsessing on trivia - which is a valid enough criticism in some cases - and the other half you're saying the exact opposite: That there is some sort of left-wing equivalent to the malicious, corrupt, power-hungry craziness that has unfolded on the right for decades, and **there is not**.  Has not been in decades.\n\nOn the right, heaping mountains of corpses and broken laws, shattered dreams, torture victims, obliterated cities, beaten women and children, mass-poverty, arrogant white-collar criminals getting away with everything all the time, governments that do nothing but serve the rich and sabotage the rights of the people.\n\nAnd on the left...what?  You don't feel safe flying a Confederate flag on a college campus?  \n\nThis is a case in point about the self-involved nature of the right.  Its total inability to walk in other people's shoes, or put its own sensibilities in proper human context.  A right-winger stubs their toe and it's an Earth-shattering tragedy, but they'll tell someone to stop being a "whiner" if they protest some 6-year-old black kid shot in the face by a cop.\n\nThere are degrees, but I think right-wing politics may simply be a manifestation of Narcissistic Personality Disorder.  The right-libertarian would be more benign versions, more avoidant and passive-aggressive than malicious.\n\n> To me, this sounds a lot like "join us or you're a Nazi"\n\nNot at all.  It's "Join us or you'll be lunch for Nazis."  If you are not 100% with them, you're they're enemy as far as they're concerned.  That's how narcissism works.  Hitler didn't care if a nearby country was neutral - it either did what he commanded enough to satisfy him or he invaded and installed a collaborationist puppet regime that would do what he commanded.\n\nI mean, Jesus, you actually feel *oppressed* by political correctness while America is under attack by fascist insurgents who would as soon frame you for a crime and send you to a slave labor camp to help build Trumpler's Wall as offer you a Tic-Tac.
what a gross little thing
> What about Trump is "conservative?" Nothing.\n\nExactly. He's not conservative. He's not family values. He's not intelligent and he doesn't have any class whatsoever (two things that I picture old school Republicans valuing). But he sure did condemn the things that many conservatives hate like immigrants and Obama and Clinton and the media and so people loved him. \n\nIt's the same reason that Milo Y. guy became a conservative figure -- not because anything about him was conservative, but because he shit talked on liberals and feminists, and "the enemy of my enemy is my friend" mentality made some conservatives like him for that reason. 
Have at it.
There are many more conservatives like me, we are pretty reasonable people but we tend to keep to ourselves. I came over here to see what you guys think. It's an attempt to keep myself from getting locked in an ideological bubble. \n\nNow you say conservatism is "a runaway train to atrocity" what specifically are you talking about?\n\nOn the civil war stuff, no one is salty about losing it because no one who was alive during the civil war is around now. And I'm not sure how you managed to convince yourself conservatives lost the civil war, it was the democrats leading the south at the time. But whatever, this is a non issue as I mentioned above.\n\nOn the topic of "Texas oil billionaires" ah yeah, not saying we don't have some sketchy figures on this side, but your side has the same damn problem. Does the name George Soros mean anything to you? If not look him up, he has done some very sketchy stuff with his money. Or perhaps you dislike foreign governments interfering in elections, I'm sure we can agree on that. If you look at donations to the Clinton foundation we see money coming from middle eastern governments like Saudi Arabia. Why would a foreign government donate money to a foreign charity instead of spending that money on charity in their own countries as they see fit. It's a problem on both sides, and it's solved by removing big money from politics. \n\n\nYou say conservatives are enraged that women aren't our property. Enraged about every single iota of progress made since the Magna Carta. This is not true in the slightest, I don't know a single person, conservative or liberal that believes this. Complete fabrication. If I'm wrong you're going to need to show me proof. \n\nAs for honesty and conservatism, I Was honest with myself, I analyzed issues from as many sides as I could, and more often than not I come back to the moderate conservative position with a few alterations on specific issues. Can you honestly say you have done the same with your ideology? Because your pure distain toward conservatives says otherwise. \n\nI too want politics to be an amiable discussion, so does every other moderate on both the left and the right. Which leads me to believe you were talking to the far right, and as I have mentioned they do not represent all of conservatism. And if you expressed your 'distaste' for conservatives in a similar way to them as you have to me, well... let's just say moderates tend to be more patient than partisans.
He deleted his comment, but this was my response:\n\nI'm sorry, but what Constitution are you reading where electoral power is proportioned among the people by the amount of food that they produce? \n\nIf that's how we're divvying up electoral power, then how big of a voting bloc is Latin and South America, where we import much of our food from? 
That's why I'm saying I hope the latter will happen. Our country succeeds when we work together. 
Yeah, I bet your pretend threat did that, and not the horde of T_D users that downvote everything critical of them. Take your advice, my friend. Get serious. \n\n

How about we let everyone have their opinion as long as they can actually articulate it and stand behind it? If this is what Manchin believes and his constituents support it, so be it. It's not about attacking others just because they disagree, that's the juvenile bullshit that got us where we are.
I mean, there are tons of reasons. This one is an example of the dehumanization of inmates. The entire system isn't based on rehabilitation, but rather on punishment, which has been shown to be less effective. Companies that supply commissary stock do so at an incredible markup (that cost goes to the taxpayers), which is then sold to inmates that are paid pennies on the dollar to produce stuff for the government, which is all but slave labor. There are literally tons of other reasons, but I figure we'll see what your effort level is here before I waste my time (based on your day old account's comment history).

I agree with said agenda, but I'm also realistic.

Sad but true. All he has to do is be *just barely* better than the alternative, and he's got it locked up. The minority party tends to make gains in the mid-terms, so hopefully people will be able to neuter Trump's spray and pray BS 2 years in.
It's up to you whether you want a system that actually rehabilitates or just one that makes you feel better about yourself. That said, that was condescending of me. My view on it is that [US recidivism rates being what they are](https://www.nij.gov/topics/corrections/recidivism/Pages/welcome.aspx), the current system of punishment as a deterrent does not work. A lot of taxpayer money goes into supporting repeat offenders, and it could be more fiscally responsible to go the rehabilitation route. The downside being we can't get our 'hard on crime' jimmies off.

I think the first part of this answer is the best. Take each one aside (not in front of your other players), and tell them that quote. It's lighthearted and shows that you're not mad at them, that you just want them to get the most out of the game. Plus, by taking them aside it, it doesn't embarrass them in front of the group, which they might resent.
For real, no. Those end zone graphics during the preseason a while back were bad enough, and the uniforms have enough going on without a random Chevy logo emblazoned across them. Some commercial breaks are ok, it's the sheer volume that is an issue.\n\nLook, official merch is expensive as hell, tickets are expensive as hell, and out-of-market packages are... well, those might be reasonably priced, but it's still an expense. The NFL has record profits nearly every year, they don't need to balance out the books to cut excessive commercials, they'll get greater audience share by cutting some.
Lol, your insight on his cut was good, but I think you're getting shit on for that deal number

I'm taking only his comments on context without making assumptions on what he meant.\n\nYou are adding you assumptions to what he means which are completely irrelevant.
Listen to [this podcast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azC1nm85btY&feature=youtu.be) It is all right there. the conversation starts around the 50 minute mark.\n\n\nThis was the source of the video. He clearly states at several points that 13 year olds can consent to sex with adults, and there is nothing wrong with a 28 year old fucking a 13 year old, as long as he gets the child's consent first. \n\nThere is no way to spin it, those are his words.
Oh, my bad. You are totally right. There are definitely cases where we should excuse 28 year olds having sex with 13 year old children. I wonder which GOP lawmaker wants to write that legislation. \n\nWhat is your take on child brides? Some are OK, in certain situations, right?\n\nThe cognitive dissonance with you lot is incredible.
The actions of a 7 year old are very rarely punishable... \n\nMilo is not only referencing himself. At several points he explicitly states that 13 year olds can be sexually mature enough to consent. \n\nDunham is absolutely a piece of shit, but Milo cemented himself as one as well.

Obama did not actually block anyone. \n\nIf there is a precedent set here, it is that you cannot block anyone, since Obama backed off and allowed Fox in. 
Oh I won't, but we need to make sure to call these types on their shit. Encourage them to apply their critical thinking skills rather than running with whatever nonsense Alex Jones has told them this week.
lol I was wondering when you were going to bring up that alt-right talking point. This is not victim blaming. Victim blaming is holding him responsible for what happened to him. If I said he was raped because he dressed like a slut I would be victim blaming. Saying that he does not get a free pass to advocate for child abuse because he was a victim, is not. \n\nHe is free to rationalize his own abuse. He went further than that. You know it, I know it. You just don't want to admit it, because then you would have to come to grips with the fact that Milo fucked up. \n\nSay what you will, but I am through discussing this with someone who wants to make excuses for rape. What a pitiful group you guys are. \n
I can sympathize for him and want him to shut up simultaneously. \n\nIf a female rape victim were an adult and she were saying it is cool for 28 year old men to fuck other 13 year old girls as long as they get consent, yes I would have a problem with that. My guess is you would too if if weren't for Milo. 
That was after 6 years of them dragging their feet and refusing to work with him. Excellent revisionist history there.

Think about how low Obama's costs would have been if not for all those death threats he got as the first black President. \n\nHe is already more fiscally responsible than Trump is, the numbers would have made Trump look even worse. That is interesting, thanks!\n
Man, if only the GOP would have taken that stance 8 years ago. Think about how much better our system could have been if they had come to the table and worked the the Democrats, rather than trying to sabotage the project.
Yeah, well except for Obama, twice, and Clinton twice. \n\nBut he definitely had the biggest EC margin for any republican since Reagan! Well, except for George H. W. Bush. \n\nBut he definitely had a bigger margin that George W. Bush did, so he's got that going for him, which is nice.
I would argue the Billionaire adult, children of the President could afford to pay their own security. That is the idea of fiscal conservatism right? Be responsible for your own expenses, and don't expect handouts from the government.
He literally said that he does not have a problem with 28 year olds having sex with 13 year olds, as long as the child is sexually mature enough to consent. Spin that any way you want, make the assumptions or justifications you need to, but at the end of the day you are still defending a man, who advocated for pedophilia. \n\nStatutory of not, I find it hard to imagine any rational adult would support a relationship between a 28 year old man and their 13 year old child. \n\nI think at some level even you understand the problems with his statements, and I am certain you would not be working nearly this hard if it was not Milo making these disgusting comments. \n\n
a). Yeah, we should assume that conditions have improved without any evidence. Excellent argument, absolutely no flaws there. \n\nb). No, they cannot. You have to request a Voluntary Departure, which requires a hearing before a judge. If the judge determines that you have committed any crimes, have had a removal order issued against you in the past,  or do not have the financial means to leave on your own, you have to wait to get a removal order placed against you. **That means you have to wait in the detention center**\n\nYou should do just a small amount of research before you spread misinformation.\n\n**edited** because you seem like the type who would be unable to connect those dots, and I want to make sure we are on the same page.
No they did not. In the full podcast he is very explicit, and goes back to the number 13 at multiple points. Watch the full podcast, and stop parroting the incorrect talking points.
Look at the bottom of the article. Obvious photographic evidence of both of them standing. 
At 56:00 he is talking about how he was 13 and able to give consent. Implying that he believes at 13, children are able to give consent.\n\nat 59:00 he is talking about how 13 year old - 28 year old relationships occur and are "perfectly consensual". Again implying that he believes that 13 year olds are able to give consent\n\nStarting around the 1 hour mark is where the viral video begins.\n\nAt 1:06:30 he says that "Not all relationships between a 13 and 28 year old are fine" Which again means that he believes a 13 year old can consent to sexual relationships with an adult.\n\n\nIf you think condoning sext with a 13 year old, good on you. But this is the kind of shit you lot are afraid of Muslims doing...
Absolutely pitiful. I don't know how anyone could listen to the podcast and come away with a different conclusion. He literally says that there are 13 year olds sexually mature enough to have consenting relationships with adults. \n\nUp until Milo said it, most of his supporters would have vehemently denied a 13 year olds' ability to have consensual sex with a 28 year old. \n\nThey are a downright embarrassment, 
I missed the part where she was doing this as a surrogate of a presidential candidate. \n\nI also missed the part where she lied about it during a congressional hearing. \n\nCan you hook me up OP?
lol you guys are top notch. Advocating for child abuse is fine, as long as you are not the one doing it. 
He very explicitly says "Not all relationships between a 13 and 28 year old are fine" \n\nWhere as 99% of rational adults would say no relationships between a 13 and 28 year old are fine.\n\nThose 1% of outliers would probably have phrased it as "Not all relationships between a 13 and 28 year old are bad"\n\nFor someone who makes their living writing ans speaking, the fact that he chose to generalize relationships as "not all fine" is telling. \n\nThe majority of people who watched that podcast the first time were also likely Milo supporters, and are very likely the same people here defending his comments yourself included. Condoning relationships between 13 and 28 year olds is condoning pedophilia. Simple as that.

No, they did not. Watch the podcast and stop parroting incorrect talking points there were no "parts cut out" he was having a candid conversation and explicitly said that 13 and 28 year olds could have a perfectly consensual relationship. Anyone listening could clearly understand that in the context he was no longer referring to his own experience.
This is where you provide evidence of the anti-white rhetoric.
Yes, he does. Go ahead and listen to the [full podcast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azC1nm85btY&feature=youtu.be). He uses the exact phrase "perfectly consensual" to describe the relationships between 28 year olds and 13 year olds. \n\nYou can find the conversation at the 59:00 minute mark.\n
That reminds me, I still need to pick up my W2 from SorosCorp. Thanks!
I know reading is not very big over at T_D, but when you read what was written, you will see that screen shot was from a [video posted on the White House website](https://www.whitehouse.gov/featured-videos/video/2017/03/01/joint-session-congress) Which very, very, clearly shows them standing.

He said that relationships between 13 year old boys and 28 year old men are fine as long as the boy is "sexually mature enough to consent".
His interview with the the drunken peasants makes it clear he thinks adults can have sex with 13 year olds as long as they get their consent first. 
lol the worst part about this, is you just know this is going to be the new GOP talking point. \n\n"The hateful left infiltrated our ranks and planted a Nazi movement to divide us". \n\n-Your crazy uncle on Facebook, probably.
When he goes on news networks as a Trump surrogate he becomes a political figure. He is not an elected official, but he is still associated with politics in this country now. \n\nGeorge Takei spoke out his experience, as a 13 year old fooling around with an 18 year old camp counselor. Huge difference between saying he enjoyed his first time and "13 year olds can be sexually mature enough to have consensual sex with 28 year old adults". You guys should drop that false equivalence, it reflects poorly on you. \n\nThat is great. [This podcast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azC1nm85btY&feature=youtu.be) Has him making several statements that relationships between children and adults are OK as long as the child consents...\n
>The fact that he believes that some 13 year olds can give consent does not mean that he believes all 13 year olds can give consent as he clarifies in the very quote that you brought up at 1:06:30.\n\nI love that up until this week you lot would be the first lot looking for justice if someone said a 13 year old could consent to sex with a 28 year old, but since Milo said it you are willing to excuse pedophilia. ANY 28 year old have sex with ANY 13 year old is pedophilia... Pretty simple stuff.\n\n
He very clearly states that relationships between 13 year olds and 28 year olds happen and are perfectly consensual. He is generalizing his beliefs way past his own experience. Why are you fighting so hard to defend someone who very clearly advocated for child abuse?
That is my favorite argument. I have had so many people say to me:\n\n "You just want free stuff. Someone has to pay for it"\n\nNo shit, I have my degree, I won't get free tuition. I have a well-paying job, with good benefits, and own a home. I'm not looking for shit. I would just prefer my taxes be spent on helping other Americans achieve their dreams rather than introducing "freedom" to other countries, or educating our children through for-profit prisons. \n\n
No, he literally used the hot teacher cases, where a young boy goes after the hot female teacher. \n\n\nSeriously, watch the podcast before you go spreading nonsense. 
That sounds like a very fiscally conservative policy. A few billion here, a few billion towards the wall. \n\nYou gotta spend money to pay off the debt the GOP has been bitching about for years, right?

Closer to 3 hours, but yes. 
The certainly did. but there is also a difference between an adult writing about things she did as a 7 year old, and a  an adult saying that it is OK to have sex with 13 year olds as long as you get their consent first. \n\nExcellent attempt though!
He was rationalizing his own abuse, and then generalizing abuse past his own experience. \n\nAnd yes, anyone who would justify sexual relations between 28 year old adults, and 13 year olds as OK, because the child was the "aggressor" is sick. Apparently yourself included, as you are adamant to point out that distinction as if it is important. 
Feel bad for Smith but thankfully it wasn't our fault
I never said that the department of education does not need to be smarter with their money, you can certainly make that argument for them as well. Our department of defense has a larger budget than literally any of their counterparts. Most of the other industrialized nations are long standing allies. We don't need to give them more money. You don't even have to give the money to our schools, I'd still rather see our roads and bridges get the attention they need. $54B is a ton of money in terms of building roads. \n\n>Even with as many as 3 million (by some estimates) illegals trying to tip the scales for HRC Trump won campaigning on this.\n\nIf you want to have a serious conversation do not throw around numbers that have no merit what so ever. There is no evidence that there were three million illegal voters. They tried to claim it was in New Hampshire, and campaign officials, from both parties, repeatedly stated their was no fraud. There is no evidence of the fraud Trump claims there is. \n\nOhio (red state in November, republican Governor, and state legislature) found 385 non-citizens were registered to vote, but only 82 actually voted. **82**. in a state that cast over 5.5 million votes, and was absolutely crucial for both candidates, don't you think they would have focused a few more of the supposedly 3 million illegal voters in Ohio? \n\n>Also we would spend how many of these billions anually by having these illegals in our country? Thats worth noting if you make deporting them seem like a pointless and expensive endeavor\n\nMost of them came into the country legally and overstayed their Visas. A wall will not stop the millions of people who will come through in similar manner, and will not verify their Visas for us. Most "illegal immigrants" in this country are paying payroll tax, and are not nearly the economic drain everyone likes to pretend they are. In fact, those same "illegal immigrants" pay about $12 Billion in taxes annually, Throwing them out hurts our tax revenue, and their employers.\n\nI'm all for securing our boarders, but this wall, and Trump's current purge are an inefficient bandaid. Immigrants will be back, and we will be back to square one trying to find them and deport them, wasting more money every step of the way.\n\n 
I saw a post on here about how the republicans have basically refused to compromise or even work with the Democrats on most issues since Clinton. It is hard to argue against that idea when you look at the ACA fiasco. The Democrats came to the table already in the middle. There could have been some more give and take and we would probably have a really nice system. \n\nInstead they are probably going to eviscerate the ACA, and then have the nerve to tell us we were stupid for ever believing it could work. 
Sorry, I understood your joke. I was trying to imitate donnie at the press conference, when he changed the stat to the biggest republican win, and he was instantly shot down for a second time. 
I would be happy to discuss this issue. I feel that we already spend too much on our military, and I would much rather see $54B go to repairing infrastructure or additional funding for our schools. \n\nI think the Military Budget is large enough, and it is up to Pentagon to be smarter with the money they are given.\n\nTrump is promising to be fiscally conservative, but is offering the Pentagon $54B, planning on building a wall that will cost around $25B, and trying to find and deport 11 million people which is being estimated at several hundred billion dollars. \n\nCutting PBS is not going to allow him to deliver on all these promises.
Who advocates child abuse, yes.
So you didn't watch the podcast, or read what I wrote. I don't care about your assumption on what he means. That is what he said. Being a victim does not give him free pass to advocate for sexual abuse.
I watched the entire video. Listened to the conversation. If you choose to pretend he was only talking about himself, that is fine, but anyone who listens to the podcast can clearly tell he is generalizing his believes well past his own experience. \n\nI don't care about "corrections" he made 13 months later. He said what he said last year. It is only you abuse apologists who need it. Give you something to cling to so that you don't have to come to grips that Milo condones child abuse\n
>I see it as him rationalizing his own relationship not condoning relationships.\n\nConfirmation bias is a fascinating phenomenon. He very clearly generalizes the conversation past his own experience.
I'm pretty sure it was a joke, because in reality George H.W Bush had a bigger victory in 88, Clinton had bigger victories in 92 and 96, and Obama had bigger victories in 2008 and 2012. \n\nHe did however, manage to beat poor old W. Bush.
He said the legal age of consent was"about right" and then made exceptions for children as young as 13 who were sexually mature enough to consent. You keep twisting it, but when you take his words in context without your assumptions he is very clearly saying that there is nothing wrong with sex with 13 year olds as long as they are able to consent. \n\nBefore this week 99% of adults would have argued that 13 year olds could not consent to sex with a 28 year old, but now that Milo said it you guys are all for child abuse.
Justify it however you need to. Your guy Milo, still condoned 28 year old men having sex with 13 year old boys. It does not matter who the aggressor is. \n\nYou have to be a pretty sick individual to think that it is OK to justify having sex with a 13 year old because "they were the aggressor". \n\nThe cognitive dissonance in the defense of Milo is incredible. Who would have guessed there would be so many  open supporters of pedophilia. 
Which of Trump's policies to you view was similar to Sander's platform?
No, this is in the full video as well.

You are failing to realize that he is also talking about any other 13 year old who is "sexually mature enough to consent". He makes reference to them several times, if you would just listen. \n\nI am calling a person who claims that 13 year olds should be able to give consent to having sex with adults a pedophile, yes.
those are some excellent alternative facts. Too bad they are all incorrect, or impossible for you to prove.
Those expenses come out of Trump's travel bucket? Interesting.
Yes, but he extended that out past just his own experience, and said other children are able to consent at that age.\n\nSo you don't see a problem with a relationship between a 28 year old man and a 13 year old boy? It is incredible the number of pro-pedophillia users there are in these threads. \n\nThere are also countries that allow men to marry little girls. What is your point? Pretty obvious that western society has a higher standard. 
Yes he absolutely did. You need to go listen to the podcast. 
In fact, Kat got his triple double against Jokic and the Nuggets lol
During [this podcast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azC1nm85btY&feature=youtu.be) It is all right there. the conversation starts around the 50 minute mark.\n\nSome of the highlights:\n\nAt 56:00 he is talking about how he was 13 and able to give consent. Implying that he believes at 13, children are able to give consent.\n\nat 59:00 he is talking about how 13 year old - 28 year old relationships occur and are "perfectly consensual".

Up until this story broke 99% of adults would have defined sex between a 13 year old child and a 28 year old man as sexual abuse. Not it seems more like 50:50.
I'd suggest you go listen again, that was not what he was saying.

Check out [this podcast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azC1nm85btY&feature=youtu.be) It is all right there. the conversation starts around the 50 minute mark.\n\nThere are several different points where he argues that 13 year olds are capable of having consensual sex with adults. It is pretty incredible that so many are listening to this and coming away favorable view of him.\n
Protected essentially means that if it falls anywhere between 1 and 18 Dallas keeps the pick. If it lands 19-30 Philly gets it. \n\nProtected picks are almost always set up that if Dallas does not give up their first this year, the protection is reduced, or taken off all together for the following year. So it may be top 18 this year, top 10 the next year, and unprotected the year after. That means if Dallas drafts before #18 this year and before #10 next year, Philly automatically receives the pick on the third year.\n\n

And here we are back to my original point that you decided to comment on, which is. If he is that messed up that he thinks this kind of relationship is acceptable, he is a danger, and we should be removing the soapbox from which he preaches. 
You're right, we should assume that a senior editor is that careless with his words, and he actually means something different from what he is stating. \n\nOr, he had a candid conversation, become too candid, and meant exactly what he said. \n\nI'm going with the later. You can justify child abuse how ever you'd like. \n\n
> And he was very clear that he believed that because he believed he did.\n\nWhich does not change the fact that he believes children are able to consent.\n\n>No he didn't, he said relationships between THOSE 13 year olds who are mentally and sexually mature enough to give informed consent and 28 year olds can be consensual again citing his own experience.\n\nTHOSE 13 years olds are still fucking children who moron.He is still saying that it is OK to fuck SOME children as long as they are sexually mature enough. His experience is irrelevant. \n\n>Beyond his own personal experience yes but it was still based on his own personal experiences.\n\nSo you admit that once again he says it is OK to fuck some children, because he was fuck as a child. Great role model... You apologists are pathetic. \n\n>Well why don't we ask him for clarification and see if his attitudes about his own victimization have changed? Oh right that doesn't count, because only the things that make him look bad count.\n\nBecause of course he changed his story thirteen months later after the story broke. Would you believe Bill Clinton if he told you he didn't fuck Monica? \n\n>How about what he said later when he clarified, oh right that doesn't count.\n\nStill don't care about an apologetic explanation a year later. \n\nBottom line is that if this was anyone other than the alt-rights Golden Boy you fucks would be foaming at the mouth, and rightfully so, but now that one of you said it, child rape is A-OK, as long as you were molested, or the child came on to you... It is like you don't even read what you type out. You are an embarrassment. \n
He made that stipulation once, the other times he did not. \n\nYou can say he is rationalizing his own victimization, but he is extending it out to any other 13 year old who is "sexually mature"
How do you still not understand?\n\nHe very clearly states that he believes that children as young as 13 can be sexually mature enough to give informed consent. \n\nHe also said that there are relationships between 13 year olds and 28 year olds that are perfectly consensual. \n\nIn both of these instances he is very clearly generalizing this beyond his own personal experience. To say that "He is probably referring to just himself" is just stupid. You have no way to prove this, and not taking him at his word is disingenuous at best. You are smarter than that. \n\n>it's probably just a victim rationalizing his own abuse\n\nThere you go making assumptions again. No one cares what you think he "probably meant". Just stop assuming that you know what he means, you have no idea what was going through his mind when he said what he said. \n\n>he said that the current age of consent is right which it is your position he didn't mean.\n\nHe did not say the age of consent is right, he said the age of consent is "about right" and then when on to give exceptions, such as, any child who is sexually mature enough (13 year olds specifically). There is a very important distinction that you are continuing to miss.\n\nYou should go back and re-listen, because you are butchering the quotes you are pulling from the interview. I don't think you can differentiate between what Milo said, and what you think he meant, anymore.
During [this podcast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azC1nm85btY&feature=youtu.be) It is all right there. the conversation starts around the 50 minute mark.\n\nSome of the highlights:\n\nAt 56:00 he is talking about how he was 13 and able to give consent. Implying that he believes at 13, children are able to give consent.\n\nat 59:00 he is talking about how 13 year old - 28 year old relationships occur and are "perfectly consensual". Again implying that he believes that 13 year olds are able to give consent\n\nStarting around the 1 hour mark is where the viral video begins.\n\nAt 1:06:30 he says that "Not all relationships between a 13 and 28 year old are fine" Which again means that he believes a 13 year old can consent to sexual relationships with an adult.\n\nIf he believes that 13 year olds can be sexually mature enough to consent to sex, then surely he believes that sex with 13 year olds is justifiable, as long as he gets their consent first. Up until this story broke 99% of adults would have defined sex between a 13 year old child and a 28 year old man as sexual abuse. Not it seems more like 50:50.

I love when Trump supporters argue about things they don't understand. They are so cute, the way they pretend words have different meanings. 
They can only take 1 player. In this example we would be trading Scandella and a 3rd to prevent them from taking Haula
Once again, this is not a freedom of speech issue. Most Universities have a very strict code of conduct that every student agrees to as a condition of their enrollment. Part of that code of conduct is that you will not do or say anything to damage the reputation of the University. \n\nIf you run down campus shouting "Death to Niggers" you are very clearly damaging the University's reputation when the video of you doing it goes viral. \n\nThe University has every right to kick you off of their property, and bar you from attending classes their. They are not restricting your freedom to speak, they are not required to provide you with a the stage to do it. Huge difference. \n

This is not going tabloid, this is being disgusted by the words of a public figure. It is pathetic that this is becoming a politically divided issue. 
This is where you cite the more than 12 times Obama committed treason.

Yeah, because the first black president never received death threats right? You guys have some of the best selective memory I have ever seen.
>t's double standards.\n\nSays the group that called for Holder's resignation, but are sitting on their hands with Sessions.\n\n>chasing a wild goose chimera that they can never catch because they care more about expressing there butthurt sore-loser temper tantrums than about running the country\n\nThis sounds a lot like the Benghazi hearings. 33 hearings and $7MM dollars later, the GOP was still convinced Hillary should be prosecuted, but had nothing to show for all those tax dollars. \n\n
Can't the same be said of the GOP? \n\nWhy were they so adamant that Holder should resign, but are all suddenly silent with Sessions? \n\nWhere are those morals that the GOP claims separate them from the left?
Your figure shows Pek's contract as well. That is another $11.6MM coming off the books. We will have a substantial amount of money to go shopping with or without Rubio's contract. \n\nI would be more interested if I was confident Dunn would be ready to take the lion's share of minutes at the 1 next year (not giving up on him, just doubtful he will be a starting caliber PG in 8 months). If he is not ready to take the reigns, we will be spending most (if not all) of the $14MM we saved dumping Rubio, on replacing Rubio. I'd rather keep Rubio, even with his limited scoring he is one of the best passers and defenders in the league. \n\n
None of his points are accurate. The cost of securing Trump tower is a completely different expense that is being paid for by NYC. The $10MM we are talking about here is strictly since he took office 1/20. \n\nHe is accepting his salary, as he has to. even IF he weren't (he is) the salary is $400k annually. His expenses for vacations are on pace to be $120,000,000. His annual salary is nothing compared to the bills we are paying for him to fly back and forth to Florida every week. \n\nHe has no plans to donate his overseas profits to the federal reserve, Anyone who believes this is insane. He want's to pay as little tax as possible. He has stated this throughout the election. There is no way we will DONATE profits, while skirting taxes. \n
At 56:00 he is talking about how he was 13 and able to give consent.

Does he need to condone sexual relationships between men and children X number of times before you believe he is sincere? 
If you listen to the podcast it certainly is news worthy
>He tried to block FOX you can't hide from the internet.\n\nTried is the key word there. He did not actually do it. There is a huge difference. \n\nYou guys lost is when he **tried** to bar one site, but trip over yourselves to defend when trumps **blocks** several. \n\nThe hypocrisy is on you, my friend. 
Yup, and if you watched the podcast I posted you would see that they invited Milo to come and defend himself over the Joe Rogan interview. \n\nThe highlights of my video are:\n\nAt 56:00 he is talking about how he was 13 and able to give consent. Implying that he believes at 13, children are able to give consent.\n\nat 59:00 he is talking about how 13 year old - 28 year old relationships occur and are "perfectly consensual".

It is just handing them a microphone and letting everyone seeing how stupid they are. 
Don't bother. None of them actually read the articles, they just make an assumption and run with it. 
While simultaneously saying that 13 year olds can consent to adults, and "Not all relationships between a 13 and 28 year old are fine"\n\nAtleast he recognizes some relationships between adults and children are not OK...

I am pro-beard.
Welcome to the team, you guys. I'm glad you wanted to participate in this crazy experiment, and thrilled you got the chance.
I'm a white guy, and I can't even imagine speaking to someone like that. Jesus. I think he was just being an asshole, frankly. I've met people who aren't interested sexually in members of other (or certain) ethnicities and haven't thought much about it, but it sounds like he was going the extra mile to be abusive about it.
Sounds like you're doing your best to decrease the unskeptical masses one at a time. Stay strong, my friend. There are plenty of ignorant people here in the United States too, but sometimes you can change minds with patience and compassion.
I've heard it said that we're the summary of the five people we spend the most time with. You can love your family, you can be there when they need you, but it's kind of obvious that they're not a good influence. Let them make their own decisions, you need to focus on building your life.
Woah, a professor that doesn't specialize in climate science is telling us all the climate scientists are wrong? Crazy world we live in. Good thing working for Princeton makes it so he can't be wrong.

My opposition to him was never policy based; he doesn't have policy. His "policy" changes from day to day and depending on who he is taking to at the moment or who who spoke to last. My opposition has always been to him, personally. He is a narcissistic psychopath with authoritarian tendencies who is endangering our constitution, the rule of law, and the survival of our republic. So, no, it doesn't matter what he does I would never support him.
Here's my question: what happens if you "stop this?" Say by some miracle the democrats are able to stop him from getting confirmed, Trump's just going to pick someone else, maybe worse. Gorsuch is extremely conservative, but he also is eminently qualified, is well liked, and has a reputation for fair mindedness even among liberals. Democrats have been given a gift and they should take it and save the fight and political capital for something truly horrible that Trump tries do so. Gorsuch is your run of the mill conservative justice replacing another conservative justice. \n\nAs for this "club," it's disturbing sure, but I would hope like hell that I'm not judged as an adult for some of the stupid shit I said and did when I was in high school.
That's an interesting point specifically on immigration. Arizona v. US seems to indicate that local law enforcement cannot act alone on immigration, but only at the direction of the federal authority; however, if the federal government directs the national guard to perform in a law enforcement capacity, it would violate Posse Comitatus. Does Arizona v. US only restrict local law enforcement from unilaterally arresting without a warrant for suspicion of being in the country illegally? In other words, local law enforcement, under local authority without direction by the federal government, could still arrest if in possession of a valid warrant, correct?
Well, one reason was that he was endorsed in his first race by outgoing AG Mike Moore. A democratic holdover from before Mississippi went full red. Mike Moore was extremely popular in Mississippi and he was AG from the late 80's until Hood took over in 04. Plus, Mississippi will sometimes disregard party affiliation when the voters know that the candidate is "one of us," so to speak. MS had a Democratic governor as late as 2000-2004 (Ronnie Musgrove). Mississippi is a very personal state. People will vote for someone they know and like even if they disagree with them politically. If they know your mama and where you came from, they'll listen to you and that's half the battle.\n\nHood also benefits because he mostly goes after crimes, etc. that everyone can agree on and stays away from partisan issues for the most part.\n\nHere's the game plan for a democrat to win statewide office in MS. That person must be: 1) white 2) male 3) religious (preferably Baptist or Methodist) 4) moderate to conservative (especially on guns) 5) preferably born and raised in MS and had to have gone to either Ole Miss or State and never left after college. In Hood's case, he did undergrad and law school at Ole Miss. It's all about getting people to say, "he can't be all that bad, he's one of us."\n\nYou get that, and you can win. The problem is that there are so few people in MS that are all of those things, and also a democrat. It also didn't help that up until recently, the Democratic Party of MS was all but dead. A previously unknown truck driver was the democratic candidate for governor in the last election. Many people think he won the primary because his opponents were both women and people just chose the man.
It's possible that he could win the seat, but probably not against Wicker. The only course for him to win the seat would be if Chris McDaniel primaries Wicker like he did to Thad Cochran. McDaniel is a tea party rabble rouser in the state senate. He narrowly lost to incumbent Thad Cochran in a runoff. McDaniel is a genuinely terrible person who isn't extremely well liked statewide. If Hood ran against McDaniel, I think he'd have a shot. Wicker would most likely beat him though. Hood's best best is to wait for 2020. He's up for reelection in 2019 for AG, which he'll probably win easily. Thad Cochran, who has been in the senate since 1978 and will be 82 in 2020, may retire. If he retires and the field is wide open, and 2020 is a democratic wave election, Hood could win it.
By many accounts, Nixon used to get drunk and order nuclear bombings of North Vietnam. Luckily there were rational men in the chain of command who knew that he wouldn't even remember doing it once he'd slept it off. Our only hope to avoid annihilation may be someone in the military chain of command refusing to follow the insane orders of a mad man. Let's hope those people exist and that Mattis is one of them.
That wasn't the question; he stated that you could add up all 3rd party votes and give them to Clinton and it still wouldn't be enough for her to win. That statement was categorically false since she could have won with only the votes that Stein got. Not only would adding up all 3rd party votes and giving them to Clinton allow her to win, she wouldn't even need them all. Regardless of who would get what votes if you were to actually eliminate the 3rd party candidates, his statement was untrue.
That doesn't sound like a confrontation as much as a "for God's sake, help us." Like it or not, we are going to be relying on Ryan, McCain, Lindsey Graham, etc. to stop Trump and Bannon from being able to bring their worst instincts into reality. The democrats are the minority party in both houses, and some things are going to get pushed through that those on the left just aren't going to like, but it's going to be up to the more moderate members of the Republican Party in the house and senate to keep Trump and Bannon from ripping the country apart. That's why there was no fight on Mattis' nomination. He's a good man and a patriotic American, not a supplicant or a fanatic. He may well be our republic's last line of defense against a madman and his lackeys bent on dictatorial power. We are going to be relying on a lot of people whom we might not have voted for or wouldn't chose to lead us.
Damn gibby has the highest sv% and most shut outs since Christmas... what a turnaround
You must not have children. I have two whose lives are just beginning. I understand the impulse to let the republicans do what they want, let them blow it up and let the people who voted for Trump deal with the consequences of their actions, but I can't allow my children's futures to be lost as well. I will fight for them. We must resist the impulse to allow Trump to screw up the country and the world because it's what his voters deserve (and it IS what they deserve). My children and millions of others out there deserve a better future than what an unopposed Trump will give them.
No, you're a monster because you support a fascist who is going to destroy the republic we've built over 227 years. This isn't an "agree to disagree" situation. From my point of view, Trump might as well be Hitler. You support him, therefore you are at worst a fascist and at best a collaborator. Enjoy the New American Reich.
I don't know why you trump trolls continue to post in here as if you're normal human beings and as if we can't read your entire post history. Fuck off. The democrats in congress will give the republicans a taste of their own medicine and will stop der führer as much as possible.
Like you, I am (was) a republican. 2016 was the first time I voted for a democrat for any office, local, state, or national. Before I give my support to any politician, at any level, that person must at least reach the very low threshold of being a decent human being. All of these people screaming "give him a chance! Give him a chance!" I gave him numerous chances during the primaries and during the general election to be a decent human being. By my estimation, he's had several hundred chances and guess what? He failed each and every time. His policies and rhetoric are anti-democratic. His attacks on the press and the judiciary are reprehensible an indefensible. He will never have my support, and neither will the Republican Party after this debacle. They are aiding and abetting an authoritarian who is being advised by people who hold our rights and our constitution in contempt. The Republican Party, barring a purge of Trump loyalists and apologists, has lost me forever. I don't agree with the democrats on everything, but policy and politics take a back seat when one party has shown that they don't even respect the very foundations of our republic. I could no longer call myself an American patriot if I supported this vile, crass, wanna be dictator.
Under Printz v. United States (a Scalia opinion BTW), states and localities have wide discretion as to whether or not they will enforce federal law. Basically, they cannot obstruct, but cannot be compelled to enforce federal law. Immigration is wholly under the purview of the federal government and if the Feds want to enforce immigration law, the states can't stop them but don't have to help either.
In that race, I'd give Hood about a 40% chance. Hood is very good at garnering independent votes and McDaniel is a very polarizing figure. You either love him or you hate him. He's an in your face tea partier with an abrasive, bullying personality. Hood is much more amiable. But Hood is still a Democrat and McDaniel is still a Republican and Mississippi is still Mississippi. Worst case scenario is that McDaniel wins and then we have a Senator who is a cross between Ted Cruz and Donald Trump. I don't think McDaniel would win against Wicker in a primary anyway. I still think Hood's best shot is the 2020 election year for Thad Cochran's seat (if he retires), when it's more likely that every democrat in the state will get out to vote.
Well that's just untrue. She would have won PA, MI, and WI with Jill Stein's votes alone (not to mention all the other 3rd party votes), which would have given her the presidency. Now there's no reason to believe that in reality Jill Stein or Gary Johnson voters would have voted for Clinton, but to say that all 3rd party votes added up and given to Clinton wouldn't have given her the win is just incorrect. She could have done it with only Stein's votes.
You're not understanding how this works yet. He won't allow himself to be wrong. They will "investigate," then come out and say "yep, we were right. Yuge voter fraud and they all voted for Hillary." And then they will proceed to enact restrictive voting laws all over the country in the name of "protecting the sanctity of the vote." Which will insure that they and the republicans stay in power indefinitely. This is what fascism looks like.
He and Bannon want to make sure that nobody ever votes again, period. They are purposefully attempting to sew discord and civil unrest. They know this stuff is pissing people off, they are counting on it. First you get the protests, then you get the riots, then they call in the national guard to open fire on protesters, then they suspend habeas corpus because of the "insurrection," journalists and politicians get jailed in the name of "national security," some go missing. 
The situation is Syria is this: it is a three fold civil war between Bashar Assad's repressive government (backed by the Russians), moderate rebels (backed by the US) who have been fighting since the Arab Spring to topple Assad's regime, and ISIS who claim it as territory in their new caliphate (basically fighting everyone). It is a front in the new Cold War. Putin has been attempting to expand Russia's sphere of influence for years into Western Europe and the Middle East. He invaded eastern Ukraine and annexed Crimea. He is propping up the Assad regime in order to have foothold of influence in the Middle East to counter our strategic position in the region (including as a base to harbor terrorist who want to attack our allies in the area). In order to achieve their aims, the Syrian government and the Russians have been indiscriminately bombing civilian populations in places like Aleppo where rebels are based. We, obviously, do not like that very much. Now, Trump wants to allow the Russians to continue to do this, allow Assad to remain in power, and basically "team up" with these two dictators to fight ISIS.
I disagree. I think these changes can happen quickly with everything going the right way.\n\nPlus, gaining momentum in the end of the season can continue into the playoffs... a streak at game 20 means nothing 
Appreciate you looking at both sides of it! We're in agreement.
I thought about this earlier today. There is a furniture store near my house that sells rustic, western style furniture. All of their pieces are hand made in Mexico. Now, I don't know that the people who run the place voted for Trump. But they are a bunch of old white people from Texas so the odds are fairly good that they did. If they voted for him, I wonder if they are regretting that decision right now. If they didn't, I wonder how pissed they are at their fellow Texans and Americans. Their business is going to be ruined. 
Dude, like 99% of your posts are nonsense on r/The_Douche.  If you're going to lie and act like you aren't excited as shit for the fascist takeover, you could at least erase your post history or use a throwaway.
Under Printz v. United States, local law enforcement is allowed to enforce federal law, they just cannot be compelled to do so by the federal government.
What you did wrong was come in here and try to act like a normal human being after "MAGA"-ing all over Orange Hitler's subreddit. I hope that someone you care about isn't first against the wall when they take over.
The only difference between an unstoppable force and an immovable object is your perspective.
They'll always use enhanced interrogation whether or not Trump tells them to, it's the CIA, no one knows what happens behind closed doors.
Don't worry French politics are in a very similar situation to America's, the kick back against corporate controlled politicians and far leftist ideals is being felt throughout the west. And trust in the mainstream media is at an all time low. It's a good time to be a moderate conservative. 
Let's do a little digging shall we? Trump's defense secretary is general James Mattis, who has come out as being very anti torture. So while Trump says one thing his actions say another. He may have said to please some people much further right than myself. Or maybe he said it because he enjoys saying idiotic things. Point being it doesn't matter what Trump said, it only matters what Trump does, and by choosing a defense secretary who is firmly against the use of torture his intentions are clear.
Republicans were irrelevant for a time but now they are on the rise, the demographics for the upcoming generation put them at moderate right of center. If you think gerrymandering is the only reason, news flash: Democrats gerrymander too. Not saying it's a good thing, but remember there is corruption on both sides.
You missed that small part where the FBI told the White House that they did not believe the reporting was accurate. The White House responded by asking them to report this to the public, and they refused. But from the article title it sounds like the White House wanted the FBI to subvert the media. Sorry but this article has some blatant spin on it. 
Don't get me wrong, I know very well that leftists are not all anti-fa members, but when I say mainstream left I am in fact referring to the mainstream left. I think within the past 8 years the mainstream left moved away from liberalism, and that is an important distinction to make. The liberals you speak of are no longer the mainstream left.\n\nAnd to clarify, we don't need to stop calling them snowflakes, we just need to be aware that it isn't a substitute for an argument. 
Agreed, we just need to make sure they don't drag us with them when they kick the bucket. 
Let's take it easy with the confirmation bias guys, if we take numbers like this at face value we are no different than the leftists who do the same. Can't forget that Fox News is a part of the MSM and it has a narrative it wants to push as well. What we really need is an alternative to the mainstream that is dedicated to impartial reporting, if anyone has any recommendations I would appreciate it.
I see what your saying but I think Brave new world" got reversed, the amount of bs combined with Trump's attitude toward left leaning media outlets has actually caused people to be less apathetic toward politics. At least on the conservative side of things. For the leftists Trump's mere existence is enough to keep them engaged. I absolutely agree with you that "Brave New World" was the direction we were headed in, but that changed with Trump's election.
Yeah probably, I don't agree with the war on drugs, the method it uses to reduce addiction in the population is ineffective in my view but yes you are probably right.
The lack of critical thinking, in my opinion is due to the groupthink encouraged by the left. Safe spaces where certain ideas cannot be challenged. Political correctness to silence decent. It all encourages people to think in the same way. For example if someone told you their stance on one particular political issue, say immigration, you could probably take a guess at their stance on every other political issue following party lines. That is terrifying because now the party politics the founders warned us about have extended beyond politicians and into the population.
In an ideal world I would actually see this as a good thing, less govt over reach, in some sense it sounds very libertarian but that's not really what he means unfortunately, I'm all for getting rid of useless regulation that drives up the cost of business but some of these environmental regulations were reasonable and necessary. 
not that i disagree, but doesn't Paulrus have more say on the PP than RC? every time i see a timeout before a PP the team is huddled around Paulrus and RC is usually pacing around on the other side of the bench talking to himself haha
A) link to specific study or article?\nB) if those studies were done with the same methodology as the "73 cents on the dollar" study then they didn't take into account hours worked, which is a huge reason behind the earnings gap. \nC) this article is still comparing wages across fields, the fact that wages change over time happens to many fields due to changes in technology that make the job easier. Furthermore this can also be explained by the same mechanism I described in B\nD) don't get me wrong, paying women less for the same work is bad and shouldn't be allowed to happen, the point I want to make is that the current statistics and data we have on the matter are being pushed with confirmation bias, instead of proper skepticism.
And my argument is his actions matter more, do you disagree?
But there is no pay gap, it's already illegal to pay people differently for the same work. The pay gap to be "addressed" doesn't. Exist for the reasons you think it does. The 73 cents on the dollar figure comes from a study that just averaged the earnings of men and women across all fields and compared them. It did not compare earnings between people within the same field. It is nothing more than a propaganda statistic that is easy to quote but isn't useful in proving anything. Assuming sexism is the cause without doing a basic amount of analysis on the data is academically lazy and dishonest. This has nothing to do with who is the "bread winner" and more to do with proper data analysis.
Your ideological partisanship will be your undoing. It seems you have self radicalized into far left rhetoric and doctrine. You have become the very evil you claim to fight. Take an honest look at conservatives, as individuals, not the extremists on the far right. You may find we aren't the sheep of Fox News you believe us to be.\n\nAs for the civil war stuff, yes I understand what you are saying. If you investigate the history behind it more you will find the republicans didn't change, rather the democrats did a complete 180 on their views and tried to out liberal the republicans. Which they did. So you are correct that the parties switched sides, but it was the democrats who said well have those n*****s voting democratic for the next hundred years. And sure enough through welfare payments your sacred party managed to keep many African Americans under their thumb. But I digress, this happened a long time ago.\n\nOn the topic of Trump, he isn't a conservative, the bully tactics he uses are no different than those Obama used, Obama just did a better job at sugar coating them.\n\nGeorge Soros as Emanuel Goldstein? I don't agree, if anyone is Emanuel Goldstein right now it's Trump. Hear me out, who is being held up by the left as "Literally Hitler" right now? Who has endless amounts of hatred directed at him for no other reason than that he has been named the enemy of the people? Trump. I don't agree with Trump on much, he is way too authoritarian for me. But to say he is trying to end the democracy that elected him is absurd. Yes his comments and actions toward the media are unacceptable, but their journalistic integrity has become unacceptable, nothing more than hit pieces and character assassination coming from left long media outlets. If you want to talk about Trump pick a specific policy he has enacted or claims he will enact and we can talk about that.\n\nAs for the Clinton foundation, don't be that Naive, it's being used as a front for bribes, that should be obvious based on the people donating to it and the amount of aid it actually puts out.\n\nAs for Russian employees controlling reddit? Please Russia has far more important things to do. If you are referring to the Donald, then yeah they definitely use their numbers to mess with posts, but Reddit in general has a left lean so this shouldn't have been an issue anyway. \n\n\nFrankly the Russia election stuff is nonsense. Yes they were clearly pro Trump, and yes there is grounds for investigation but if you want to talk about election fraud all you need to do is look at the DNC. They screwed Bernie by issuing independent voters absentee ballots at the polls, these ballots were then never counted. And as most of Bernie's support came from independents, he was left up shits creek without a paddle. Think about it, he drew huge numbers to his rallies, but when the votes came in, those numbers weren't there. Once again, didn't agree with Bernie in the slightest, but that kind of malicious dishonest should be considered unacceptable to anyone who cares about our democratic process. \n\n\nI am aware of trumps people saying exactly that kind of stuff, and yeah that bothers the hell out of me, the same way the dishonest of the far left bothers me. We are only talking about ideological extremes here, but they don't  accurately represent the majority of moderates stuck in the middle. As for Steve Bannon, I previously mentioned he is an opportunist who says what ever he has to gain power, and the people he is speaking to are specifically the alt-right, just to keep them on Trumps side. And as mentioned before the alt-right will only last as long as far left does. Without anyone calling for an ethnic cleansing of whites, there will be no reason for the alt-right to call for an ethnic cleansing of everyone else. Simply put the alt-right is nothing more than a reaction to the far left.\n\nConservatives turned to Trump because he is immune to political correctness, which is nothing more than 1984 newspeak that is used to forcibly censor conservative view points. The moderates that came to support Trump did so because they were not being heard by the government. It was the left's reckless use of political correctness as a political weapon that had caused the current political climate. It doesn't matter way you spin it, the left lost its ability to argue, and instead turned to collectivism and censorship as a substitute for evidence and analysis. 
Your right it probably is, but I seriously doubt this will matter 4 years from now.
That's what I'm worried about, when the democrats finally calm down, our side may not be prepared to debate them. The same way they weren't prepared to debate us.
"Whoever controls the past controls the future" anyone else wondering why 1984 has become a play book when it was meant to be a warning? Luckily for us the internet is still written in ink. 
Curious, why not duchene? Is it because he's a center?\n\nHis speed is exactly what we need 
could be an interesting move to try to pick up two depth wingers (depth being like Eaves, not a 3rd/4th liner) to spark some offense and avoid giving up anyone too valuable
good point about stoner. forgot i had some glimmer of hope that we would shed some cap space with the deadline
From what I read on the Taps menu, it was closed only during lunch but open for dinner.\n\n
nixon was at [67%](http://www.gallup.com/poll/4258/history-shows-presidential-job-approval-ratings-can-plummet-rapidly.aspx) after being re-elected and that dropped down to 36% by august of that same year.\n\nall it will take is a revelation or a real mistake and his popularity will tank. he's been an idiot but hasn't done anything terrible yet... it will happen
i don't follow the deadline often so i don't know how it works... how can deals be made after?? isn't that the point of the deadline?
BXA probably plays because if it was theodore-holzer they would get the shit kicked out of them physically. we have a big body on each line: manson, bieksa, and lindholm, who has vastly improved his physical play and has become pretty lights out
Let them deny, deny deny.\n\nIf there is something condemning and they don't do anything about it, it will leak and all the deniers will go down with the ship
Well we have 19 games to pull our heads out of our asses. It can certainly be done but we'll see.\n\nWe went on our 11 game streak during feb last year after a fairly inconsistent season so maybe there's hope 
That's what McGinn thinks
If we trade for a quality winger and lock down our game, I think we make a deep playoff run. \n\nIf we don't trade for a winger but we lock down our game, I think we still have a decent shot. \n\nIf we don't trade for a winger and don't lock down our game, we'll be lucky to make it out of the first round
I wonder if bob is an adrenaline addict 
An upside of the vermette deal is that we get to check out some new players like this.\n\nHopefully he can spark something 
Actually I don't think even smith could have stopped that. Perfect shot on a complete screen. \n\nStill, fuck 
i've said this so many times. let's assume the blame is 100% on the team and 0% on boudreau. if you're GMBM, what do you do?\n\nit's much easier to fire BB than to fire the entire team.\n\n if you strip the C from getz, who do you give it to? perry is too quiet and Kesler does not strike me as a leader in the locker room. he seems too much like an asshole... a loveable asshole, but not somebody i'd want to lead me.\n\ntrading getzlaf/perry would be nearly impossible.\n\nit wasn't necessarily that everyone blamed bruce, but a change needed to be made and he was the easiest way to do it
Our team would be a top contender if we could stop shitting the bed for a period every game and worked on finishing chances.\n\nA new player isn't completely necessary if we could just get the team to play a full 60 minutes, but it would certainly help 
You raise an interesting point. I wonder if teams are adapting to perry's bad season and focusing on other players
Isn't this exactly what happened last time we played you guys? A goal followed almost immediately by another goal?\n\nAlso I'm just checking in - how is kerdiles doing? Stoked that 2 of my favorite players scored
yeah it says that i made a mistake and was, admittedly, totally turned around in my interpretation. im human
That was the best game I've seen Vats play all season. That pass from Getz was unreal.\n\nPerry was.... ugh. We looked good. Real good. 
forget shooting themselves in the foot, they're just cutting both feet off at this point
He needs the garbutt conversion therapy treatment
Pence is a piece of shit but anything terrible he would do would be domestic social issues. The American public/organizations like the ACLU showed they can fight those, but no rights lawyer can stop trump from doing something monumentally stupid to another foreign country.\n\nPlus, there would be absolutely no respect for Pence. The whole GOP will be tainted 
Our carry-ins haven't done shit either :(
this was my initial reaction to it. if trump wants to highlight the crimes of only one group, the response must be to either highlight their benefits or highlight the crimes of other groups to prevent from alienating (no pun intended) the immigrants targeted.\ni would prefer to see how much good is going on vs. how much evil a group can commit
Holy shit montour is the real deal.
I get a lot of my ideas while I'm driving, for some reason.
i'm guessing it's probably because those "cool kids who win at prom" are the ones wanting to cut funding to arts in favor of the military. of course the artists are going to be upset about that!\n\nedit #2: i apparently completely misinterpreted the comment above me haha, my bad. ill keep the original comment as a badge of stupidity 
at 24, i'd hardly consider crammer a prospect. he's just about hit his ceiling, imo
I sort of wish somebody tried to drop gloves against Manson, so he could have beat the shit out of them too\n\nManson can hit, fight, and apparently score. We better protect him
Yeah actually most teams probably play on their heels a bit.\n\nSpeed wise we look pretty good 
fuck i hope so
Could have easily had 2 more goals + the empty netter. The effort's there, just need the finish
wish i could answer that. im not too familiar with coaches but maybe not a lot of better options on the market?\n\nPaulrus seems like he would have been a good fit, but who knows
Our SOGs were weak but we were also playing against what is essentially a 5 man D. SOGs will drop sharply when a team turtles correctly, and when you combine that with our lackluster offense it's not pretty 
i live a pretty disappointing life... i was born in the disappointment
We can't buy a fucking PP can we\n\nNot a single shot on this kid! Come on ducks 
If we lose him I will be so sad. So so sad
Souray's slap shot on NHL 15 (maybe 14?) was out of this world. My roommate and I would just slap with him and it was a rocket
first of all happy cakeday.\n\nsecond of all, that's what i think i'm going to do. just a matter of not wanting to drop $200 all at once for everything haha.\n\nas somebody who is pretty regular on this sub, i'm curious about your opinion on something. do you think nicholl and AFF prefer different "types" of scripts? mine is a dark comedy and my gut tells me that it would fare better at AFF than nicholl.\n\ni submitted an earlier draft of it to both last year and made it to the second round of AFF but it didn't go anywhere with nicholl. I got really encouraging coverage from both AFF readers and made the script much deeper, but i'm still not sure it will be as palatable at nicholl
if it's an ongoing investigation, i can't imagine the FBI even CAN be forthcoming.
not only that, but she looked calm as hell! i would be projectile vomiting the lyrics out
definitely better than boll, but shaw plays decent PK minutes. and at this point boll should be kept to be exposed for the expansion draft.\n\ncrammer's contract was up so we'd have to resign him before exposing him
 i can see us calling up garbutt for the end of the season/post season but we needed boll to play 40 games to be eligible for the expansion draft. \n\nthe problem is that if we waive boll then a team can pick him up and basically just have a warm body for the expansion
when history looks back on this administration, there will be moments  that clearly caused the downfall of Trump/possibly the entire GOP.\n\ni sincerely believe this will be one of them
Not too fond of the guy but there is nothing particularly surprising about rich people donating to politicians, and the women's march was planned for weeks. The news was broadcasting stories about bus permits and everything. It was never "spontaneous."
yeah, if you're investigating something as big as this, you can't just go talking about it willy nilly
i mean i feel like it's better than the standard "I got a 3 on the blacklist, the site sucks" threads
No disagreement there 
Would love to have Tatar or nyquist.\n\nJust don't want to give up montour, which is what I imagine we'd have to add to a more experienced defender
exactly. we fix 1-2 of those 3 problems, and we're a good team. we fix all 3 and we're a great team
more than a few people slumping, i'd say. the good thing about slumps is that you can usually crawl out of them
raks, silfverberg, and cogliano are all pulling their weight. even ritchie  and the other bottom 6 forwards are doing fairly well
If we could have 1/2 the intensity of the 2nd period we would have scored like 4 times against this guy 
it's amazing to me that these people can show up to a rally, hear all of this protest, and then go home and act like all is well
we fix those problems? absolutely. 
SIINT doesn't sound quite as good as SAINT.
we could trade a defender in the off-season, too. we're not necessarily guaranteed to lose one
i think when stoner comes back we'll hopefully see less of bieksa and more of stoner, which i'm fine with. it's just a matter of when he comes back. i actually think\n\nfowler-manson\n\nlindholm-sami/montour\n\nstoner-theo/holzer/montour\n\nlooks pretty good. stoner's pretty solid in playoffs... nothing fancy, just grinding
I have been to bootleggers so many times it must have just slipped my mind. Love that place! Could start at the library and move there haha
kesler has improved every year since 2013. 43 points, 47, 53, and now currently 44 with another 15 games to play.\n\ngetzlaf is definitely getting older but with 2 more assists he's in the top 10 for the league, which is pretty good considering he's missed some games this year and the team as a whole has been slow on offense.\n\nour roster can certainly be there, we're just not playing our best
he slumped while the team was doing well but he's thriving on this line with Getz and Ritchie. All 3 of them are getting it together
i liked his energy and his fights, but 5 years from now i'll probably forget who he was tbh
Stay. Unfortunately the odds are that you won't make it big and you're going to want a degree to fall back on.\n\nSource: am currently falling back on degree
Our only top gun who is playing like he's old is perry. Kes and Getz are playing fine, and the rest of our team is fairly young and full of talent
I feel bad for the guy but I am happy to have bernier's contract off the books next year. We need a backup goalie that is somewhat reliable
here's the news about it:\n\nhttp://abc7.com/news/anaheim-protesters-clog-streets-surround-cars/1768469/
wouldn't be at all surprised if it was a foreign country looking to sow even more discord in the USA
doesn't paul and other GOP senators have to vote for it to pass? why would they be alienating their own side... they already have nearly 50 dem senators that will most likely vote against it
got it! very few of them have lines so I'll just distinguish those. thanks
please tell me this all comes to light soon. please
im pretty disappointed that we didn't make a trade but let's not pretend that all GMBM had to do was wave his magic wand to make a trade and that he was just too lazy to do it.\n\nit's better to not make a trade than to make a shitty deal. asking prices were steep for the players that we needed
I totally misread that line and thought you were referring to the goalie that came in for smith\n\nI don't know why I thought "as well as anyone else in the league" was an insult and not a compliment haha
Just means we have to win by 2 (without an empty netter) to justify it or else we'll be cursed with karma for eternity
Yep! Unfortunately gotta finish... we'll get there 
ice time and brass knuckles
Caps last Saturday
I guess the optimistic thought is how good our team would be if we played consistently haha
Show her a langhammer
My guess is that they're just throwing money at anything to help our offense score more goals\n\nAnything aside from a much-needed LW, that is
right-o. everything changes in the playoffs. great teams can collapse and mediocre teams can shine
That whole line looks good. We need great though
i would love to have duchene... put rakell-duchene-cogs with fowler-montour for a blitz attack
Manson is a monster
Captain material
it's certainly not going to be easy... if it was, we'd have done it already. i think having playoffs looming brings a different motivation, though. we shall see
... and us scoring 5 goals literally the game right before this haha
How about a tropp hat trick to tie the game up and a last minute perry goal to win it? 
i also think people with progressive ideals are drawn to CA naturally
If a tender is a shitty puck handler, wouldn't you want to dump and chase? Also, we were being stood up in the neutral zone... dump and chase was our only option. 
If it's like this again next season then the upside is that I could see him being fired mid-season. So maybe only 1.5 seasons??
good point! still... it would reflect badly on him (i think) if he doesn't do something here
tbh i'm still expecting a trade for us tomorrow. i just can't see us going into the expansion with fowler, lindholm, manson, and sami and not getting anything back for at least one of them.\n\ncrazier things have happened, though
all those voices in his head!
I think it's a mistake to adopt the language of identity that the ~~alt right~~Neo Nazis use. by labeling oneself "alt-anything" merely serves as a psychological reinforcement for the fascists now running our government.\n\nwe should call them what they are: Fascists. plain and simple. we can worry about what to call ourselves later. 
if you got infuriated, then you let Trump get what he wants: to rustle jimmies. \n\n
Westoros 2000^tm.\n\n\nKhaleesi........in........*SPAAAAAAAACCCEEEE*
not universally. a majority of catholics would still balk at the idea of *killing* someone for bad mouthing their god, whereas a majority of moderate muslims *would be okay* with the same thing. (according to most objective polls). \n\nIMHO, how vicious a religious group is towards dissenters is in direct correlation with the level of education available to a given population. In city centers in the US, where good schools are readily available and education is valued-- religious sentiment is mostly very LOW, or very tolerant. In states that have very poor education and very poor standards of education--religious sentiment is very HIGH and arbitrary religious standards are valued more highly than human rights. In very religious *countries*, education tends to be undervalued and religion overvalued to the point that one could be either killed by the state, or lynched by angry neighbors for insulting somebody's "all-wise, all-powerful" god.

ah! you need to pick yourselves up a can of "Child Welfare Accountability"^tm. \n\nyou will be AMAZED at how fast Catholics disappear!\n\n:)
> we have to be careful about conflating belief with truth\n\nbut in the previous paragraph, you claimed:\n\n>The final authority on what is right or wrong is God. We have his word in Holy Scripture. The Church is the tradition that must parse that out.\n\n--which is a *statement of belief*, not objective proof. it's one of the easiest logical fallacies to think that simply because something is "written in Scripture", then it MUST be "the truth". Why is the Bible the source of truth,and not the Quran/Baghavad Gita/Code of Hammurabi? YOU claim the Bible is true, but that's only because you were raised to believe it was true. If you had been born in Saudi Arabia, you would be arguing the finer points of Islam, and telling me \n\n >"The final authority on what is right or wrong is Allah.. We have his word in Holy Quran". \n\nthat doesn't make your claim objectively true, it's merely a claim based on anecdotal evidence, and hey LOTS of people make those don't they? should we believe all of them??\nI merely changed 2 words from your original statement, the words for "god", and "scripture". EVERYONE can't be the "only one with the truth"----that's like believing the 2 different churches in 2 different countries of Europe that BOTH claim to possess the "actual head of John the Baptist"--are both telling the truth! ONE of them has to be lying, but most likely they both are lying. \n\nevery single religion claims to be "the ONE truth", and they all claim that the others are "liars/evil/pretenders/lost/whatever message is politically expedient at the moment". you can't ALL be right, either everyone except ONE person is lying, or (most likely) you're ALL lying. (of course, I'm using the word "you" to refer to the purveyors of religious dogma, not specifically YOU)\n\naccording to your claims, the Bible is the source and justification for the Church, and it's true because the Bible says it's true. You believe it's true, because it's "written down"......but that is a HUGE logical mistake! just because something is *written down*, that thing is not automatically true, otherwise there REALLY IS a band of  Jedi warriors somewhere out there protecting the galaxy, and there REALLY IS a magical school for wizards and witches called Hogwarts----there are SO MANY BOOKS about it! it's written down, so it must be TRUE! \n\nsee how ridiculous that sounds? try reading some passages from the Quran or Baghavad Gita and tell yourself that this stuff is TOTALLY TRUE---can you sell yourself on it? Try reading some of the origin stories of the Mormon faith and see if you think that shit's real, or even better--try reading up on Scientology! \n\nyour ENTIRE justification for your position is based on something that was written down 1800 years ago or more, depending on the book of the bible, written down by people who believed that epilepsy was "demonic possession", and that illness was a "curse"! and you think THOSE dipshits are smarter than the end result of an additional 1800 years worth of human progress? that would be funnier if people with power didn't use that shit to exploit other people....\n\n>However, as you have noted, the human beings who make up the day to day of the Church and her efforts are obviously flawed like anyone else. \n\nthose human beings are the ones *who made this shit up in the first place*! Even if you're delusional enough to believe that "god INSPIRED men to write what they wrote", THOSE humans were flawed and were making it the fuck up. one, it's always MEN who "find inspiration from god", and two: whatever these men claim that "god" wants always seems to work out to the great benefit of the men who make the claim. SURELY their motives are pure! /s\n\nif Scripture is "true" because it's written down, (with all its attendant claims of ideological supremacy) then the book of ~~Moron~~Mormon is true, "dianetics" by L Ron Hubbard is true, and someone writing a fantasy novel about witches and wizards is really a *historian!!*\n\n>I figured I had a 1/4 chance of being right. If it wasn't Dawkins, who was it, Hitchens?\n\nHAHAHAHA! that's hilarious man! thanks for showing your ignorance. 
Who's going to make the bigger corporations play fair when the publicly accountable institutions are unfunded, undermined by unaccountable private interests drowning them in their proverbial bathtub?
lol, "we're dressing up as ghosts to scare the new neighbors away. they have to know their ultra-wealthy lifestyle threatens us"\n\nI'm pretty sure that was the South Park episode where Token gets all his super rich friends to move to town.....
um, if you neglect a child to the point that they die, you will be charged with "negligent homicide". That is what these creatures did to little babies. \n\npart of what makes this so unbelievably fucked up is how vehemently the Church makes a show of "caring for the unborn". apparently, if you're poor or a "burden" then your baby's life is worth shit to the Church\n\nbut, yes it is murder to neglect a child to the point that it dies. 
yeah, but that guy sure can't take a knife to the back, though....
His father was a cunt.
that's because God is really your pscho ex-girlfriend. *"If you don't love ME, I'LL FUCKING BURN YOU FOREVER!!!"*
Hop on Pop. saves money on the title, anyway....
>I want to point out that you seem to have shifted away from the philosophical/historical barbs and now you've moved on to calling Catholic's pedophilia apologists. I suspect you already said everything you memorized from that Richard Dawkins video you watched one time, and now you are moving on. Am I right?\n\nnope.\nthe pedophilia scandal actually does color my entire perception of them, so while historical controversies merit some discussion, any claim of "moral authority" on the part of the Church is laughable at best--because of what the world knows at this moment about them, re: the massive and continuing coverup of pedophilia. \n\ndid you just pick an atheist's name out of a hat, to accuse me of being their acolyte? lol, now who's constructing a straw man?\n\nas for what you said about *hearing* bad things about the Church all your life, I realized that I misspoke: I meant you most likely *believe* that the Church is a source for objective good......and if you really wanted to, you could reinsert that sentence back into my previous statement and see if it makes more sense. I know I wouldn't take the trouble, but then again, I AM arguing on the internet, haha!\n\n\n> those priests who molested young boys and those priests who covered it up, committed a grave, moral sin. What they did is so heinous and damaging, I can't even imagine what their punishment will be. \n\nI totally agree, but I can imagine what their punishment *should* be: a lifetime of imprisonment. should I infer from that statement that you believe they'll be punished in hell after they die? if so, I'd love to know what makes you believe that. \n\nOne could argue (and often the most boorish and douchetastic apologists do) that "every organization that large has bad people in it, it doesn't make EVERYONE bad"----and if that's true then other organizations' actions could be used as an example of what the Church should have done, and should still maybe get the fuck around to doing. \n\nThe issue that separates the Church from other organizations is the *coverup of the pedophilia*, which was conducted not by priests, but the upper hierarchy of the Church starting with Bishops. When a Diocese is sued regarding this, the lawsuit is for negligence on the part of the Bishop for knowingly hiring a pedophile and not warning the community. \n\n>Okay, now there is another fact which is worth noting. At the time these severe, evil transgressions were discovered,\n\nsorry to parse this statement a little, but what to what time are you referring, that the transgressions are discovered? which year do you mean? this shit goes back to *at least* the1940s. on to the meat of your statement:\n\n> the Church actually did consult psychologists, asking what to do about these priests (Note: this was a wrong and bad idea). These psychologists (secular) told the Church that pedophilia is a psychological condition which can be rehabilitated. We all know this is plainly false and incorrect, but the Church listened to them\n\ntrue, but again, this is not their CRIME. although it shows a shocking lack of empathy for the victims to the point that even the psychologists didn't note anything about it, apparently. the crime was in not reporting these men to the police immediately, and turning them over for arrest and criminal prosecution. \n\nthe failure of the Bishops to report the pedophiles and turn them over to police is also a crime! just like helping a bank robber makes you an accomplice to the robbery, protecting a pedophile from justice makes one an accomplice to the pedophilia. \n\n\n>I also have to point out that the overwhelming majority of priests have never done anything like this. In fact, Catholic priests commit abuse at a rate lower than the general population of men. \n\nquite true, the number according to Pope Francis is 2%. This is why the Church's pedophilia scandal can't really be compared to other organizations, because other organizations will fire a guy for that shit when the Church will move a pedo around to evade detection, and in some cases attempt to buy victims' silence,\n\na quick glance at the USCCB's website tells us that there are roughly 400,000 priests in the entire world. I don't think that number includes Bishops or higher, and I'm not sure if that includes the different Orders. If Pope Francis says that 2% of priests are pedophiles, simple math tells us that there are, at this moment, *8000 pedophile priests around the world*. Another thing that separates this scandal from other organizations is that *the Church knows who and where these men are!*. \n\n>Whether or not Catholicism is true doesn't depend on the moral character of its members or clergy. \n\nyour understanding of my argument is fallacious, lol! I said the Church has no *moral authority*, because of the (lack of) moral character of its clergy/hierarchy.....i.e., the men who made up all that Catechism bullshit.\n\nCatholicism is objectively untrue because it doesn't stand up to logic, nor are its claims reproducible or even provable. *that* has nothing to do with moral character, it's just garden-variety bullshit, spread for 2000 years.\n\nwhat the church did in Africa was to undo ~10 years of the UN's efforts to curb the AIDS epidemic in Africa. by the 1990's, condom education had finally started to take hold in Africans' minds and the AIDS rate actually started to come down.....until the JPII splurted out his doubling down on the "no contraceptives" BS, so African priests started telling their flocks that "condoms *cause* AIDS*, and "wearing a condom is a SIN".  within a few years of that, the AIDS rate went back up and is still pretty fucking horrifying today. \nMillions and millions of people died, and the Church didn't have to do anything but preach a fucking lie. THAT is some A-level EVIL FUCKING SHIT^tm\n\nIndia---for starters Mother Teresa was not what Catholics are instructed to believe. I would recommend watching "hell's angel: the real story of Mother Teresa"----not as "gospel truth". that would be far to *religious* of me! lol. find out what other people (not the Church) say about her.\n\nThe Church also takes full advantage of India's very generous "blasphemy laws", in which someone can go to prison for 20 years b/c they "hurt the feelings of a religion". all the local religions do that there, which really just shows Catholicism is no better than any other insane delusional religion...\n\n\n>No, you are not right. I am guessing that you define evil loosely enough to mean anything involving Catholicism.\n\nuh oh, did I touch a nerve there? that almost sounded pouty! you guessed wrong, again. Nice strawman, though! I define evil as anything that contributes to the misery of another human being, and I define "misery" as "unnecessary suffering". \n\nclaiming that atheism has no moral objectivity is, well, objectively false! does what you call "objective grounding" mean "based in the bible"? if so, I've got bad news for you.... :) \n\n\nhumans have been around for many millennia, and in that time we've come up with around 3000 different gods/religions to explain the world and give us rules to live by. the names, places, stories, are all fairly different but there are several things that every single one of them have in common.  what Xians call "the golden rule" is one, and something like that can be objectively shown to make people get along a little better. I think the first instance of "do unto others, etc" being written down was on the Code of Hammurabi. \n\nthere is such thing as objective morality, and it is utterly independent of religion. sometimes the 2 walk hand in hand, but most times morality is like the distant unloved in-laws to religion: never present.\n\n\n
they're just as likely to be jacking off in the confessional as they are to "forget" what they heard....
I would visit r/excatholic, we're waiting for you! welcome to reality, friend!
so Alex Jones has gone from being a "bulldog" to "lapdog". good, good, it is as it has been predicted.\n\nit's like a Moebius strip of insane stupidity: who's chasing who in this equation? 
while I think it's patently evil to do such things, there IS a way to do something that has an equally upsetting effect on those Mormons who baptize the dead: [All Dead Mormons Are Now Gay](http://alldeadmormonsarenowgay.com/)\n\nyou can type a name in, or let the database choose a registered Mormon at random, and with a single button the deceased will be made into "a gay". :) 
until you die. they don't care after that, they'll just say you're in "heaven" if they like you, and *at best* stay silent if they don't like you. 
there must be another set of pedophilia revelations in---OH WAIT. The Royal Commission Inquiry into sexual abuse by priests in Australia *JUST CAME OUT*, and it shows that **20%** of Australian priests engaged in pedophilia between ]1985 and 2015.](http://www.abc.net.au/news/2017-02-06/royal-commission-into-child-sexual-abuse-begins-in-sydney/8242600) \n\nthat's in direct contrast to Pope Francis' claim in 2014 that ["2%" of priests are pedophiles.....](http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-28282050)\n\nthat's how subtle and polished these fuckers are at mass distraction! *the entire debate over 'Amoris' is a spin job!* It has extra believability because there are people who are legitimately spun up about this and don't have any ideas about anything else...
that's called "moving the goalposts" in an argument. the Church is really, really good at spinning a web of codependent logical fallacies. as u/muffinlemma said, they've had ~1800 years to perfect their mind control. 
oooo, 'memba when Alex Jones used to talk about how Bush and Cheney were "war criminals" and should be "arrested, tried and executed"??? \n\n'memba when he pivoted to Obama-hate and forgot completely about Bush/Cheney on Jan 21, 2009? Yeah, I 'memba.....\n\nthat was fanTAStic.....
of course he did, they can't have priests taken away from running churches. they *spent a LOT of money* getting these guys to be priests, and they aren't about to "lose" all that investment to a long prison term. **/S**\n\nthey're afraid of justice, which is why they've spent so much time and money at both fighting bad press, and fighting against paedophilia cases: the more they lose, the more *public trust* they lose. the less the public trusts them, the less their pews are going to fill up on Sundays, and the less relevance they'll have. Knowing that they're also aware of this does a lot to explain the wildly disparate messaging that seems to come from the Vatican. (to me, anyway)
it's all part of God's Plan^tm!\n\nalso, HEY LOOK OVER HERE, A **SAINT**!!\n\nlove, the Vatican\n\nps, shut up\n\n/s
or a Planet "Kolob"\n\n
goddamn, these motherfuckers will do ANYTHING for a paycheck!
I used to live in a Muslim country, and they're much more comfortable with a higher level of violence IRL. Americans have a high tolerance for violence as long as it's virtual/on TV/on the internet, but when faced with the prospect of ACTUALLY getting violent, Americans suddenly get much more philosophical. \n\nI'm only speaking about the *majority* of American Xians. the American Taliban are still a relatively small wing of the whole....they just have a much louder voice than the rest. 
>~~Pastafarianism~~ ~~Scientology~~ ~~Mormonism~~ ~~Islam~~ ~~Christianity~~ is a 100% legitimate religion\n\ndon't create another fucking religion please. in 30 years folks like you will start to sound like L Ron HubbTard. \n\nit should remain a joke used to pillory institutionalized religions, not join the "circlejerk".\n\n\n/my 2 cents
ever heard of 4chan? 
He may be able to build that wall after all with the bricks shat by people he conned. Their party spends decades undermining every safety net, but people decide to trust Trumpence who says he's looking out for the little guy.
I think the current admin is a giant shit show, but I have to call out HuffPo for being deliberately hyperbolic in their speculative predictions of war. These are the same assholes who shit-talked Bernie Sanders and assumed Clinton was the winner 3 years before the fucking election. \n\nif they could stop acting like Fox news and just report things that this admin is ACTUALLY DOING, instead of jerking their puds about "what they MIGHT do! eeek!", that would be greeeeeeeeat.\n\n
he'd have to be able to maintain an erection for longer than 10 seconds, to pull that off. 
> I agree with you that the abortion thing in the OP is probably a distraction, and that **neither of us know what it's a distraction from**\n\nthe part I emphasized shows that you are aware of the fact that I don't know what we're being distracted from, yet you keep trying to get me to offer conjecture. that's why I think you're concern trolling me. \n\nyour question is moot. I'm not "mad" at you, nor do I assign "evil" motives to you, you're just wasting time worrying about what neither of us have the access to know. \n
I read the entire Bible when I was in 8th grade, that primed me for disbelief b/c while I was interested in all the battles and wars described in the OT, it got REALLY fucking boring and really disjointed to the point of being slightly ridiculous. (these were the thoughts in my 13 yr old brain)\n\nmy mom started taking some classes in Church history from a guy that our parish thought was "out there", b/c he taught about all the evil shit the Church did in the Middle Ages. She would tell me all about the classes, and THAT helped me disbelieve quite a bit! she still bought the religion, she was just awake enough to be dissatisfied with the place of women in the Church, and rather angry about the state of women's rights in general. \n\nthen, the people who purveyed the religion were objectively monstrous so it was actually kind of easy for me to pull the plug for real once the massive scandal hit in 2002. 
this is a feint, designed to distract you away from some other Republican agenda item that is FAR, FAR more destructive/unnecessarily expensive/overtly targets the RNC's *target du jour*.\n\nmy source: 30+ years of watching them do the same fucking thing over and over again and somehow nobody calling them on it.
are you in HS or college? how much fallout will you potentially experience from angry theists in the following weeks after the class? Is it worth the trouble you're potentially opening yourself up to?\nIf you're in a financial position that depends entirely on parental help, and this gets back to them, will it potentially threaten your income/tuition/living arrangements?\n\nif these questions are all meaningless to you, then by all means carry on! if they have meaning, though--perhaps consider picking your battles wisely. I'm not saying don't do it, just consider potential social fallout from it. 
I'm not saying you're wrong about the nature of pastafarianism *as it exists today*. It's just that given enough time, repetition, and "dedication", it can become exactly what it means to mock. \n\nby the way, you should come to my church service this tuesday afternoon, at the First Pastafarian-Alfredo Church of Ramen. Donations are mandatory\n\n:)
I really hope that you can realize one day, that nobody here really cares about what the "other" sub thinks/says. this is "EXcatholic" because nobody here wants to hear from them, since *nobody cares what they think*.....except, apparently, you. \n\nby paying so much attention to them, you are giving them power over you. if they can keep pissing you off, *they win. again.*
that pastor is fapping to your friend's FB pictures, I guarantee it. why else would the guilty little masturbator write a 2000 word sermon on her page? He probably wrote it in a fit of guilt right after he came.\n\nsorry for the gross image, but this guy sounds like a real piece of crusty cum sock. 
Do you have a copy of, or access to a collection called "the Other Bible"? It has a TON of books that had been excised from the NT, and some additional Jewish apocrypha. the Gospel of Mary Magdalene, Gospel of Thomas, and various Apostles' "Apocalypse" story. "the Apocalypse of Peter" is particularly interesting regarding a "magic battle" between Peter and an unnamed "very famous magician" in Rome...
it's the ongoing effort by the Church to bring catholicism back to the level of islam! 
what got me through the turmoil my catholic friends and family try to claim that "I caused" by not believing; was a Dr Seuss saying:\n\n>Those that matter, don't mind. Those that mind, *don't matter*. \n\nyou will find friends who are not abusive assholes with their religion. I'm sorry, but if that girl is messing with your head trying to get you to go to church with her, *she is not your friend*. She's a sociopath who's trying to exploit you when she perceives your "guard is down". \n\ntry this, maybe: tell her in no uncertain words that while you appreciate her concern for your "soul", you will not EVER turn catholic, and that you would rather hang out with her and not talk about religion. If she then starts finding excuses for not hanging out with you, you've got your answer as to whether or not she's a friend. \n\nclosing one door usually opens another, I've found. 
totally! those gospels put a canonical Jesus story in a better context for me: the story about when Jesus returned to Nazareth as an adult, preached in the local synagogue and then the townfolk tried to throw him off a cliff---he gets out of it.....somehow. \n\nwhen I read the story about him, at age 5, *KILLING another 5 year old* for kicking over a sand castle, then at age 10, turning a group of older boys who were about to beat him up, into *goats*......OF COURSE when Jesus returns to his childhood home, at least ONE of those (now) grown up kids would recognize him! \n\n<Jesus preaching in the background> \n"Hey, Morty--is it just me, or does that guy look like the asshole who turned us into GOATS when we were kids?"\n\n--"Holy CRAP, it IS!! let's GET HIM!"
The enemies are the ones they choose to arrest. They ignore the crimes of friends.
I'm envious of ex-mormons because they can successfully remove themselves from being counted as "mormon" by their church. :/\n\nI know we can just ignore the Church, but it does kinda piss me off that despite what I believe, the biggest pedophile factory in the world (RCC), counts me as a member! *fuuuuuuuuuuuck*
what you experiences is a secondary logical fallacy, called "moving the goalposts", also sometimes referred to as playing "pigeon chess" (even if you follow all the rules of chess and play a good game--at some point the pigeon is going to take a shit on the chess board, knock things over and fly away)\n

how anti-semitic are YOU at this moment, as a practicing Catholic, OP?\n\nlol
um, no. an "atheist's bible" would be a blank book. It's an actual religion (if you take what the Satanic Bible says literally, but hey isn't that *every fucking religion?*)\n\nthere's a section in the back that has spells and incantations to make the gullible think that "magic words have special powers", but it, like any book of religion, should be taken with a big grain of salt, and a healthy sense of humor.

.......at the moment. it's not very serious *right now*, because the people who came up with it are still alive and know it's all a joke--like Scientology WAS until David Miscavige came along\n\nit's all hilarious until someone comes along and kills the founder and takes over the religion and pursues it earnest--like Scientology/Mormonism....both jokes to their founders, and both hijacked by someone with visions of unlimited money.
very true, but it's a lot harder if she's surrounded by her family who put major (but loving!^tm) pressure on her to stay. \n\nI was raised catholic, and I didn't pay attention, but it fucked me up just the same...
ugh, please not like HIM. I agree with your sentiment, but damn Bill Maher is a fucking blowhard. As liberal as he is, as anti-religious as the guy is, *he's a vaccine denier*. He is actually one of the idiot fucking liberals in American society who provides the right wing with all the ammunition they need to hold liberals up as "wild-eyed morons". \n\nhe really, really makes liberals look like fucking idiots, and I'm very liberal. He's part of the fucking problem. \n\nI don't say this to dump on you, however. I just hate me some Bill Maher, especially after this election. 
you didn't meet me when I was 15......

the real test is to see if Australian judges and Australian society still remembers and cares about this, one year from now......or 2 months from now, when the Church will undoubtedly trot out some tired-ass colonist from the 1700's and make him a "saint"--and he'll be AUSTRALIAN, so EVERYONE will just *forget* about all the rapey shite. \n\nI'm not throwing shade at Australian people, I truly hope that nobody forgets this shit, EVER, and that every time any fucking Catholic official opens their pig mouth, the first and only question from any reporter is, "WTF is up with all the kiddie rape?"
their over-reporting helps them when it comes to asking for tax breaks or other special consideration from lawmakers; citing the "public good" they can do since so many people "belong" to their church. \n\nin some countries, the Church has a sweet deal with the government that gives them *tax revenue based on their membership numbers*, so artificially keeping people on their rolls makes monetary sense, if absolutely lacking in moral integrity. then again, this IS the organization that inspires the Mafia....
this would be where I'd put the Peter Griffin .gif:\n\n\n*OH MY GOD WHO THE HELL CARES?!?*

most of the time, it's satisfying to have your opinion validated by a person from "the inside". I'm not happy to have my opinion confirmed by this. \n\nthe abuse survivor who was offered the position by, and tried to work with the Vatican has quit because *according to the last 3 years of her experience*, the Vatican doesn't give 2 fucking fucks about children, or stopping rapists. they want us to STFU and go away. \n\n>She decried the "cultural resistance" at the Vatican that she said included some officials refusing the pope's instructions to reply to all correspondence from abuse survivors.\n\nclassy! SO classy!\n\n>Collins wondered if the continuing reluctance to address the problem is "driven by internal politics, fear of change, **clericalism which instills a belief that 'they know best' or a closed mindset which sees abuse as an inconvenience?"**\nCollins said she didn't know the answer "but it is devastating in 2017 to see that these men still can put other concerns before the safety of children and vulnerable adults."\n\n\nI can't say it any better myself.

unless you're talking to someone with intelligence similar to Ham's, you could just make the same argument back to them when they try to use the Bible as "evidence"....
he came to your school to MEET the homos and have sex with them late at night in public parks. \n\nthat's why all these right wing anti-gay nutjobs are so crazy about the "hoe-moe-sexial agenda"---because the way *they practice homosexuality* really IS a form of mental disorder. It's called "being in the closet".
that would be out of order, unless Jesus is multi-orgasmic. 
yeah, that was frustrating to watch. in my version of the scene, Oberyn would do the same grandstanding, but instead he should have accented each repetition of his mantra "you raped her, you murdered her, etc" with a STAB to the hands/feet/non vital body parts.

depends on who you're talking about. rank and file republicans? utterly depends on the individual and how they live their lives.\n\n RNC leadership? completely and without reserve. They have been agitating against their own government for decades now. what is their incessant refrain when they're happily indulging in their ideological circlejerk? "we just want government to be small enough, so we can *drown it in a bathtub* HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHheheheehehe" see? it's a *JOKE*, it's *FUNNY*, they don't REALLY want to eradicate the US government, they just like to SAY that over and over again for 30+ years..... \n\nare traitors who work for foreign governments against their own countries - evil?

I wasn't intending for that implication to be taken. of course it's not an INTENTIONAL smoke screen. The Church is a worldwide organization with a large degree of local independence for individual parishes/orders/organizations dedicated to some Church cause or another. \n\nIt's a "happy coincidence" for the Church that THIS controversy is *available* for exploitation and attention at this moment in time. If the Royal Commission had released its findings next month, the Church would counter with something else that is legitimately happening somewhere else in the world. That's the nature of "spin"----you *can't* just make shit up and continue to enjoy the public's perception of your credibility. "Spin" is really an art: the use of distraction is necessary, but equally necessary is the *true nature of the distraction*. It CAN'T be fake, or engineered, it has to be something that has grown organically on its own time.  \n\nThe Church's PR firm is simply availing itself to ALL information that's made public by and about the Church, so they can coincide a "bad" news story with a legitimate "good" story, and the faithful don't start asking tough questions and second guessing their donations. 
Ridiculous that you are expected to fund random perks for other people that the company sort of gets credit for. Seems like a form of social pressure to conform to their way of living to have a chance at sharing those perks. \n\nI don't know how you would get them to make it a policy, but it wouldn't be so bad if it was a standard $10 contribution when someone had a birthday or work anniversary (pick one). Then it would feel more fair.
MILLIONS and MILLIONS of ILLEGALS!
no, bro--all that christian nationalism had been around since colonial days, b/c that shite was brought over in the first place by the ancestors of the braying religious morons we have to deal with today. \n\nthe money and slogan were changed because of the Red Scare, and it was changed in 1956. Christian nationalists merely enjoyed a *resurgence of influence* b/c of the Red Scare. later, in the 60's the religious right ramped up the crazy with the formation of the Heritage Foundation in 1964, and the "Catholic Advisory Board" or something like that--they censored Hollywood movies that were "dirty" or "a little too Commie"\n\nbut don't think for a second that religious assholery trying to overly influence our government is a NEW thing that sprang up in the 20th century. Thomas Jefferson has TONS of correspondence and writings about his constant battles with theists. Preachers tried REALLY REALLY HARD to enshrine Xianity in the Constitution, and they used the same fucking arguments that preachers use today! \n\nthe reason the US has "separation of church and state" is because the Founding Fathers didn't want preachers/religion to have a large influence on government!
well, there ARE ~~people~~ fucking rubes in Russia who [actually believe Putin is the reincarnation of the Apostle Paul](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chapel_of_Russia's_Resurrection).....makes total sense that he would be playing up that shit as much as possible for his own benefit.

>it's kind of sad to think that catholics believe humans to be immoral and flawed.\n\nmy friend, it's *absolutely vital* that catholics feel that way about themselves,as well as everyone else. Without self-loathing, none of the silly catholic machinations would ever, ever stick with anyone. \n\nto me, the real evil behind catholicism (and really, any religion if you boil them all down) is the concept of *telepathic sin*. a "good" catholic is supposed to "guard their mind" against "sinful thoughts", and that *thinking* about a sin *is the same as committing the sin IRL*.\n\n Did you just think about pre-marital sex? SINNER! *shamebell.gif*\n\ntalk about a recipe for psychosis! \n\nI agree with you in that Francis is *a WHOLE LOT* better than the last guy, but 1) that's a REALLY REALLY low bar to pass! the last guy was an *actual member of Hitler's Youth*---they could have gotten Anton LaVey up there and he would have looked better. 2)don't hold your breath on any kind of progressivism in the Church. they're really good at saying what their crowd wants to hear, and Francis is no different. outside of North America, the Church is far more conservative, and they won't stand for anything like that. \n\nwhat kills me about Francis is that despite all that he's said, there STILL hasn't been a single Bishop or Cardinal put in prison (or even tried in public) for their role in covering up decades of aggressive pedophilia. \n \nI think there are a LOT of great human beings, and 99.999% of them are not connected to clergy of any kind. \n\ncaps for emphasis, not yelling. also, I'm just saying this for discussion's sake. I'm not out to "win" anything. cheers! :)
well, why do people go to any particular church over another one?\n\nthe choice is made mostly through trust in the pastor and the staff. If reports of kids being diddled make it to the news, who the hell is going to trust that pastor anymore, and come to church there? (and deposit all that sweet tax-free money?)\n\nif a pastor/Bishop/church is able, they'll contact the news to try and "work out a deal" to either NOT report it, or help them "manage" the story so the church doesn't get torched by angry parishioners, or the offending clergyman isn't summarily lynched......that's the reason that's always cited by apologists, and yes, property damage and vigilante justice are both bad things.  All too often, though, the above reason is used *in reality* to limit public knowledge of the incident so the church doesn't lose money and ~~gullible rubes~~parishioners.
wow! after ALL this time, the score is still that LOW?? I guess that proves that arguing over religion really is a zero sum game!\n\n2000 years, and the only points scored have been 1-0. lol

You're all hopped up on capitalism and don't realize there is plenty of wealth generated to pay a living wage for all jobs. 
The corps won't pay for people they don't need. That profit is for the owner, and everyone else can die. Workers must change the distribution model before we are unnecessary.
Maybe if we keep framing the gains in terms of race we can keep that trend going. There might be a problem if the workers all agree to let each other flourish instead of scraping by so the rich can bank enough for another generation of their descendants to never work. /s

Combine urban voter fraud myth with the "murder spike" and anti-sanctuary city rhetoric and he has a case for occupying the home base of the opposition. Then we go from the resistance to the insurgency.
Then they probably don't see Obama as reasonable, and they may not even see past Republican presidents as reasonable. That would make their reasoning highly questionable.
The Trump Tea party thinks their gender, religion or color will protect them and don't realize how many of their jobs and benefits come from the government. They think only lazy minorities will be cut off, but they will not be spared suffering.

They either don't have much opportunity to understand who is to blame for their problems (i.e. the powerful, not the powerless) or they took that opportunity to dig deeper and have stared into the abyss for far too long.

It's sad that just enough people turned out to not vote for Trump, but they didn't care enough to make the choice that would stop him. 
I'm a cider fan, too. This sounds great!
They know nothing, so let them be consumed by their anger and not set you aflame. I take the high road of compassion by supporting policies that give everyone their basic needs and opportunities for kids to learn more than their parents.\n\nDid you see Sec. Clinton's poker face during the debates? That's one of her superpowers. 
Feel free to create a viable alternative. Just don't expect the presidency to be the first federal office your party wins.
Since forever. If there was no moneyed class, there would be no need (nor excess money to pay) for protection (provided by various armed forces, managed by a beauracracy) from the deprived class. How much crime would there be if everyone had free access to food, clothing & shelter?
Except the point is not how damning the content was, but how benign compared to Trump's tweets and his cabinet's exploitative policies.
Because otherwise police and providers would be investigating.
Keep the link for solidarity.\n\nRemove broken link to Confederation of Anarchist Reddits.
To make America great we must crush the unions that represent about 9% of employees! 
There is a lot left up to executive discretion. For example, the Bush admin deleted millions of emails that were subpoenaed and didn't have a problem getting elected. 
They eat it up because it's shared by their friends who live in supposed freedom. Their friends wouldn't lie to them, aren't corrupt and aren't being forced by a dictatorship to post those things. Thus a little more consent for fascism is manufactured.
It's a great meme if you want people to think war is justified by profit.
Better for everyone who doesn't starve or die of preventable disease or get killed in a war over profits?
Just don't expect it to be be free.\n\n\nhttps://www.tesla.com/support/service-plans\n\n"Tesla Ranger service may be available in your area. The service fee is based on $3 per mile from the nearest Tesla Service Center. The minimum fee is $100."
If you can't get them to set fair policy, consider addressing the matter as if they are panhandlers. Don't carry cash. Say, "I don't have cash" or "no, I can't [afford to] help you." Even if it's not true. Guilt them, "sorry, I gave my extra money to charity X already." Bounce it back, "actually, would you mind giving me a few dollars to help with Y?"
The anxiety is real, but sadly they blame the powerless and cling to the powerful who profit from their exploitation.
Absolutely, but the gov is controlled by corps opposed to sharing the wealth. So people who make things in factories could protest by sending products to people in need regardless of ability to pay. 
In addition to tight margins competing with Tesla in sales, you will probably also need to compete for investors to capitalize the operation. Big lenders who are eager to do that are already funding Tesla's lease & financing program. 
We are all a product of our circumstances. If it helps, you can use it to explain that white people are racist because they are  bombarded with messages about the how (virtually powerless) minorities are the source of their problems. This makes the poor whites cling tighter to the rich & powerful even though they have more in common with poor minorities. 
Democrats can merge with Republicans when they turn on Trump. Then we can have a new left party focused on universal health-care and civil rights. 
The 2nd amendment is not to stop the police, but for personal (preferably organized) protection for those not protected by police.
To make America great we must crush the unions that represent about 9% of employees! Definitely don't worry about the C suite getting paid millions and the shareholders getting billions in dividends.
Should be easy to find a good deal on something 8+ years old that seems like a nice upgrade.
They took an excessive share of the profit (which their only use for is finding something else to invest in) from the workers who need that profit to pay for immediate needs like medicine and education.
He won't be impeached as long as he signs what Congress wants.
Especially those that came out to vote for 3rd parties. You really made a difference. 
Just incredible how hard he openly projects his failings on the Democrats -- saying they're the ones paying people to do things at his rallies, wanting to put G.Sachs in charge, spreading fake news...
It's pathetic for someone to expect everyone else to stop Donnie if they won't get behind the qualified alternative. It's too late to build a better party for this election. After Hillary wins, I hope the Sanders faction will go after R. Senate & House seats that have been "safe" from traditional D. candidates.

A lot stopped paying attention a year+ ago. 
That's the irony of libertarianism. They bristle at conformity to democratic government regulation, but worship powerful corporations that are even more authoritarian. 
The key is recognizing the state as the protector of inequality.  Equality (co) is made possible by high productivity (so there is enough for all), education (so people know they can end needless suffering) and globalization (to end nationalist justification of exploiting people far away).  Once there is no privileged class of owners to protect, the need for a police state will disappear and  society will simply produce and distribute what is needed to everyone.\n\nedit: You probably know this already, but Stalinism was far to the right of socialism, Marxism & Communism as it involved the restoration of capitalist elements. 
Pick from the replies under news stories on Twitter about politics or shootings.
The Democrats still won't acknowledge the culture war is a real war now. Too many think it was won around 2010. They rarely acknowledge we have been continuously at war, killing for bad causes over 15 years. We need a new left party. 
I know that feel. Hoping there's a service center in Memphis by the time my reservation is filled.
You can wave hands and decide that building an electric car is a simple industrial project, but the problem for the traditional auto makers is they have to undermine their ICE tech while they are still trying to recoup the sunk cost. Maybe there will be a wave of consolidation if a few can find a buyer for ICE tech to give them capital to go electric.
No, the states make the rules.
No need to wait for charging on long trips if you travel light.  Unless you needed to keep cargo in place, you can just switch cars at or near the charger.
Looking like we might need a new distribution model since the masters aren't very flexible on wages.
I don't see how their rep could make the difference if these are your only options. If you decide what you want, you can go somewhere else to get it. I have a BS in CS, but don't work in academia.  I'm making a good living with a degree from a mediocre state university.
The conflicts of interest and direct income from illegal foreign and domestic sources are quite real. The evidence is already there to be collected if they care to investigate. It's a matter of national security for the case to proceed ASAP. 
So anything not being discussed is probably happening. hah.
The article is very sloppy in its argument, but here is a summary that serves as a basic response.\n\nSection 1. We are the only valid religion.\n\nSection 2. Theocracy is better than secular government, but we're losing.\n\nSection 3. Society should be organized by religious rules, so people don't feel a need for respect or equality.\n\nSection 4. Science can be ambiguous, but the book of Mormon is not.\n\nSection 5. If I just ignore reality, I can live in my own little world of faith. \n\n
All those accounts are why he gets to fuck the rest of the country though.
That is bad advice in general. Being in a single investment that is up over 4000% is a great reason to diversify. 
Capitalism has devoured democracy. People are mostly trapped in their own struggles, and those who have time care about government are misled & denied information. There used to be a level of transparency that Bushes, Clintons, Obama maintained that wasn't ideal, but somehow because that wasn't perfect we chose someone even less transparent instead of re-building our institutions on better foundations. 
If the choice is between war for profit or war for Trump's ego, I'll take the status quo all day.
Small government is not an option for a large economy. Either the workers participate in oversight role to share the benefits, or if they can be discouraged, the government forces can protect the large corporations.
They have no idea who is really to blame for their problems - the billionaires exploiting them keep their anger focused on minorities. 
Since there is no security, we can stop paying trillions for it. That'll free up a lot of spending money.
Seems like a huge constitutional loophole that the founders didn't consider that under single party rule, a corrupt president could be supported by congress (the only ones who can impeach) for partisan reasons. The media has little desire to investigate (favoring ratings over the boring job of distributing truth) and very limited access when investigative attempts are made. 
Wow, talk about **blind to the suffering they've caused.** Sorry you can't handle living in a pluralistic society and have been deluded into thinking only families with the right Christian structure (no telling how you define that) should exist.
That may be the core of it. I have seen people who to  my dismay avoided discussions like land mines. They communicate their half baked, self destructive positions in frothy slogans and immediately avoid eye contact.
statistics don't apply to individuals.
What do you mean by the word "liberty"? What is liberty and what government you know that doesn't try to control at least something?\nI am not defending any particular  leaders, far from it, I hold them all accountable and usually guilty as charged, but using highfalutin (read meaningless) words does not promote good policies.
who comes? the police, the army, the national guard? how are you planning to defend yourself against a squad of trained violence professionals armed to their teeth, some of whom have killed people before? isn't a good way to get shot fast and a lot.
The problem with death is that it's irreversible. The problem with nuclear fire is that it doesn't ask who made the choice to be in it and who might feel otherwise. As for slavery I may feel the same way about it but I'd still suggest trying it our first and then you can always kill yourself if you find that to be the case. Even better, you can spend time on a plan and make your death contribute to the cause of liberating other people. Dying in a blast will certainly achieve nothing.
how long do you think Merkel can hold up? She will go one day and one of MVCs will move in.
is that what happens to people when they rob repeatedly while carrying weapons? They just lose their current job and have to change careers?
It blows my mind how people's cognition can go so far astray. Opposition to abortion is so misguided it seems to be a clinical condition. But then so is racism and opposition to socialism and a few other things. People just plant something completely insanely wrong in their heads and keep it for the rest of their lives without giving it a moment's thought.
I have always said that voting is a responsibility that requires competence that is not guaranteed by age. A test seems necessary but I can't imagine how to make it abuse proof.
You are right of course. I feel that way because for me the matter is thoroughly explored and saying that the very conversation is moot is honestly just a rhetorical tool to emphasize that point. I would engage with a concrete person if there was any chance of achieving a result. It just saddens me greatly that we as a society are so far backwards that this conversation takes place in public channels. 
That! Better Dems and better policies. Not only California paves the way for a lot of nationwide reform but it also has a lot of problems of its own worth fixing. Make it a better state and everyone benefits.
This was awesome!
Is there a way to add this summary to the sub description?
The so-called "pro-life" position is so unjustifiable that it may qualify for a clinical condition. There are many ways to go crazy with a belief system. If you are fully sunk below the surface of a crazy conviction you would have difficulty making the choices that actually benefit the society. It doesn't mean that we have to try to look at that situation with sympathy and understanding.
Seriously? is that some sort of a prank?
Given that for the last few decades Republican is no longer a political opinion but a diagnosis, settling down in a good job won't do it to you. People have to be seriously traumatized or damaged to begin with to vote against their best interest and general common sense.
I didn't say that they can't have an emotion. I corrected the misattribution of that emotion. National pride is not real pride but gloating propped by tribalism and encouraged by hawkish governments. Pride is reserved for one's own accomplishments. 
Not to forget that the aforementioned conservative Dem had ho clue what he was doing about Vietnam, his expertise and passion were entirely out of foreign policy and focused on civil rights. He went along with what was offered by the "experts".
Grew up hating? was that a thing running in families?\n\nWhat was/is she hated for?
What the hell is their problem? Do you get where they are coming from? I am so sorry to hear that. Your insight is appreciated.
One of the few real patriots and certainly a hero. He sacrificed a lot to make his country better. That's what heroes and patriots do.
And this is what gives the press a bad name. They went out of their way to publish the face of a guy (Steele) who is hiding for a good reason while his collaborator has been found dead. \n\nThis is not investigative journalism, this is reckless endangerment.
"I don't think a woman should be president. Women are too emotional." the exact words from a female voter over 60 yo.
Don't you think that the situation was a tad different then?  If Wright brothers had a nickel for every time Icarus was mentioned to them I bet they would use all that money to keep trying to fly.
Hey, hands off! His name is pronounced like "hill" as in a small mound covered with grass and flowers, where you can stand overlooking a beautiful landscape, wearing a white linen suit and a sun hat.
Clownsticksky
It's sad to think about the role Obamacare has played in this election. I bet nobody envisioned that outcome. I personally know two people who were loyal progressives and now claim to hate Obama with passion only because their health insurance premiums went up. That's how much simple dollar amount affects politics. I know a few more people who vote exclusively to lower their taxes. Most of them don't understand how progressive taxation works and have no idea how their taxes will really be affected but saving a buck is the blinding first priority. I find it morally repugnant but this is not the public opinion. There are quotes floating around that paying taxes is not patriotic or moral. Well, try having a country without the shared pot. 
Yes. 
Are you forgetting that the US is not averse to invading or meddling in any place when it doesn't like the direction it's  going? It's never quite successful and is always disastrous but it doesn't stop anyone. Nothing new or shocking here.
A university system is indeed still good but the natural selection of students by ability to pay for the tuition will backfire sooner or later. Scientific research which is required to produce short term profit is not all that healthy. Scientists who moved  here from different systems notice a glaring lack of long term research into subjects not immediately profit related. \n\nSo while every good thing is good to have, we can't relax and pretend that there are no problems left to fix.
By better games you mean what exactly? invasions in sovereign countries, hunting down and murdering leaders, spraying poisons on forests, drone strikes that make people fear clear skies, orchestrating military coups utilizing country's internal tensions? Are those better games?
One person just complained on facebook that she took a test that places your views and she ended up on the left while she considers herself staunchly republican.
In every instance there is one fact and infinity of lies.  So alternative lie is just another lie.
Don't tell her that quite yet but call her every day and demand that she releases the taxes and more. Pleeeeease!\n\nFaxes work too. Free fax programs online. Emails don't count. call or fax.
You clearly don't mind thinking, which is great. You just have a few broken links to repair. It's a life long process. \n\n>My strict definition of liberty is the freedom to do things without external influence affecting the decision.\nThere are always external influences affecting our decisions.\n\nConsider the value of the first statement given the second. Ideology is only good as a shortcut when it's firmly supported by reality. In practice it doesn't happen and ideology ends up being just a false beacon used by those who need to follow something for lack of ability to lead themselves. Why bother with ideologies at all if you can actually think for yourself? The analogy would be steering a ship around hidden rocks. Those who know the waters well and can process the signs of turbulence will rely on their skill, those who can't will have to follow prescribed landmarks which can be incorrect to begin with and don't reflect any changes.\n\nYour rift with reality here is in inevitability of influence. You can trust that every decision to have an abortion is inevitable, just like you can trust that every decision to have a heart surgery is inevitable. People don't do such things on a whim, only when they are absolutely compelled by circumstances. I doubt you need a refresher in biology to realize that this is indeed the case, but maybe you do. What is more relevant to you is that you personally benefit from people having their abortions safely and easily. The impact on the society is profound. \n\n>I try to minimize my footprint on everyone's life and want others to treat me the same.\n\nThe choice how to spend your days is yours to make, but the rules that govern societies are not yours to will. You can live a hermit's life even in the middle of the city and I will not try to debunk that your impact on the society may be minimal. However unless you withdraw entirely form any civilization you will be under a significant influence yourself. You are choosing to ignore the effects that exist for the sake of maintaining your ideology.
If they thought that invading a sovereign country and killing people there was somehow justified they don't deserve support. It's not that difficult to understand.
I am too disappointed that he didn't do more. But it wasn't nothing. His list of his accomplishments is long ([here is one version](http://washingtonmonthly.com/magazine/marchapril-2012/obamas-top-50-accomplishments/)). He is just not constantly bragging. And this is how decent people behave, they work and don't demand credit for it.
pathetic. are his constituents ok with it?
I don't take anything on faith. I have knowledge and assumptions. The majority of decisions is made with incomplete information. That's a fact and it doesn't require faith in order to function. If the evidence is scant my confidence in those assumptions is lower. that's it.
It's all moot. Police should stop shooting people. period. They are not the punishers, they are the protectors. But they don't seem to see themselves this way.
A lot of people are guilty of glamorizing the military. Anyone who blurted "thank you for your service" to a random person in uniform is guilty. There is nothing citizens can thank them for. They serve not the country but the military industrial complex, aka the bad guys. They country is poorer and less liked for their "service". They would serve the country if they trained to defend it in case it was attacked but refused any deployment overseas. But honestly, traditional warfare on the american continent is not likely to materialize. So it's all done for displays of power abroad and it's not pretty or honorable or useful to the country. Someone surely finds it profitable so a handful of people have a reason to thank the military but not the rest of us.
And how is invading a sovereign country of Iraq and murdering their rightful ruler not a criminal act?
It never hurts to know another language and another. Particularly from different language families. It opens your eyes not only on the intricacies of your own word craft but also on new ways of forming thoughts. A very useful skill all around. and it's never too late to start. I have just started Japanese a few days ago and I practically feel my brain growing neurons.
It certainly excited quite a few people but we don't need to fall for this diversion. I personally haven't looked at any of these links and don't plan too. Unverified allegations are a waste of time particularly now when they are so easily manufactured. \n\nWhat we do need is to set to in order what we already have. And there is plenty of it.We don't need Kremlin's vaults before we pay due attention to what we already have in our own vaults at IRS. All the shady dealings and frauds can be investigated locally. 70 years of complete disregard for law and decency are bound to produce enough material to get anyone behind bars. If that's what we want.
At this point I see biblical laws as easily reversible damage. Many other types of damage Trump/Bannon team is capable of are permanent. 
It's not my choice to avoid an argument. I would love nothing more than to see a change for the better. I didn't expect you to ask for a challenge. I still doubt that your motivation is to challenge your views, maybe you look for a chance to dig deeper. But it's worth trying.\n\nThere are many ways to look at the world differently. I can't begin to guess what led you to your current position. If you are willing please try to use every bit of education and imagination you've got because it all comes in handy. \n\nLook around you right now and notice all the man made elements you can see. Imagine them all gone. No furniture to sit on, no buildings to shelter you, no cars to get you to places, no roads to connect those places, in fact no places particularly to get to, no materials, no plastics, fabrics, bricks, metals, rubber, no paper,  no technology, no job, no infrastructure, no communications. It's just you and your family against the wilderness, against hunger, danger, disease. Anyone you meet is a potential threat or competition for resources.\n\nNow bring your modern comforts back one by one, realizing that they are not gifts from god or christmas presents from loving parents. Everything that makes up your life the way you like it has been created by people, for people, because of people. Try to imagine what went into each element of your life. You are part of an enormously complex system. Not a single person can fathom all the intricate connections that make up our lives. You desperately depend on the rest of humanity in ways you can't even trace. You can't sever your connections, nor would you want to. Your proclaimed independence is actually a myth or a delusion. It gives you some pleasure to think this way so you perpetuate it and dress it in other layers of philosophy. \n\nYou can't evaluate the value or effect of other people. You can't declare that they are free loaders on YOUR resources. If you work an unclaimed plot of land without any help or tools not made by you, then the harvest is yours. Something tells me that this is not the way you earn your living. The resources you are using are not actually yours. They came from the system, they were made available to you by the system. You may or may not feel genuine gratitude for their existence but you can't claim that they are righteously yours. Buildings would not be built just for you, planes would not fly just to get you where you want. People you so despise are the reason your comforts exist. The very system that made you wealthy exists because of not despite all the elements that make it up.\n\nIf you fail to grasp that. You can try this: since people already exist and you don't have a way to make them disappear, happy people make good neighbors. It's in your best interest to have as much satisfaction and as little desperation around you as possible. And "around" doesn't mean your immediate family. You would be better off if everyone you interact with or even see had a better life. An extra buck in your pocket doesn't have the same effect.\n\nWell I tried. have to run now. not holding my breath, but hoping.
What current state of the media do you mean? Unlike a religious institution, the media doesn't have a single consistent message reinforced by threats of punishments if you don't swallow that message.\n\nIt may be the case in North Korea but for anyone with internet and an ability to process English words there is plenty of material to navigate between biases and lies. It's only a matter of willingness, time and brain power.
of course! Freedom of speech is not freedom to spew harmful lies. It should be renamed into freedom of honest benevolent speech. As long as you are honest and don't advocate harm you are free to speak. 
I am one of those you don't need to worry about. I don't make random announcements but the first opportunity and it's out. I just assume that everyone around is an atheist and those who are not... it's their problem. I never thought it was such a luxury.
Do you think she is sleeping with Trump because of love?
I'll let you know if they do the same at Atlanta this weekend. Going for both days.
get out. it will not be easy at first to break so many habitual connections, but I am willing to bet that a few short months down the road you will not feel the negative effects any more. If you can move to a different town it will be over even quicker. \n\nThe liberation is magnificent, the horizons are ever expanding, the relations are more genuine and satisfying.\nI wish you the best in your endeavors.
are you referring only to anti-vaxer conversion or other things too. We have a whole lot of communication problems between people now. And many people suggest the ridicule is the only solution to convert those who seem far gone. I seriously doubt that shaming and ridicule can help to convince anyone, but this approach of patient kindness seems so frustrating. Do you think it's worth bracing oneself to master this method. 
yep. sounds like a hero fantasy all right.
It was his time to reminisce so the usage of "I" was entirely appropriate. In a State of the Union address it would be different.
This is not the right forum for a lecture, and the data has long been available to you. Besides people are not known to soak up other's opinion, you have to make your own journey. \n\nAnd you are already doing the right thing. Asking the right questions: "Is it only peoples "problems" that affect others? Why not every personal choice a person makes?"  Drawing lines is every bit as important because there are no infinite values. Liberty, life, love, all values have their limits beyond which they stop being values and start being toxic. Some limits are really out there on the fringes but exploring them is still a good practice. Gives you confidence in knowing how far you are from that boundary. \n\nWe humans are complex creatures, we have many needs. Maslow tried to organize them into a hierarchy and did a pretty good job for a theory. But as we know theory and practice are the same only in theory. In practice they are not. And our needs can and do come into conflict with each other. Besides, while the bottom of the pyramid raises few questions, the top of the pyramid is different for different people. So arguing about some high end values, like self-actualization (Maslow's personal pinnacle) is pointless without thorough self-knowledge. \n\nI guess a valid starter for an exploration is what world do you want to live in. It's not a hard question for most. People can come up with something pretty easily. Matching a personal universe to the real one is a difficult task. And reconciling it with the personal worlds of others is even harder. We don't have the luxury of Zaphod Beeblebrox. We have to share the universe. And the rules of sharing are out of our control. \n\nWhat about your notion of liberty? How do you define it? Does your definition work for those you have unavoidable interactions with? Even if you see yourself as Tarzan swinging on vines yodeling to your heart's content you are still not entirely free. You are a slave to gravity, metabolism, limits of your immune system, susceptibility to venoms etc. And god forbid you meet yourself a Jane, you get a whole slew of other dependencies.
I am not sure there is any possibility of reasoning with some people these days but old habits die hard. I used to think that any two people can come to an agreement given a long enough exploration of their differences. \n\nGeneral words, like good, bad etc don't work. The devil is in the details. \n\nWhat do you see in Trump that gives you any confidence?
No, it has to be legal action swift and sweeping. Complete seizure of assets and trial of the leader. It will be like opening the cage for all of them at once.
If you participated in making it happen you have every reason to be proud. Making your country a better place is certainly an accomplishment. If you just watched the process or naturalized after the fact you can be happy for your country and contribute to further betterment by studying how it happen and spreading the word and standing guard that no bit of hard won progress  is reversed. There is always a lot of work to do. Basking in past (someone else's) glory doesn't usually help much.
Absolutely!
It IS a real question. And gun laws do need to change. Before that happens I'd suggest making every act of firing a weapon by police a bureaucratic nightmare with serious punishments if found unwarranted. So if they perceive a clear and present danger and sure they will be able to justify it later as an extremely exceptional and rare situation they can choose to use their weapon. Otherwise, they must be trained to handle a variety of situation without resorting to violence of any sort. Not only they lack this training but also the media and films perpetuate an image of exclusively violent encounters.
I can't agree. US military hasn't been involved in anything remotely justifiable for about 70  years. The last vets worth supporting are at least 90 years old. For the rest of them refusing to be deployed overseas is the only honorable option. Their job is to defend the country not to attack other countries. If they don't see it this way then they are just the classic bad guys, the ones that the heroes of action movies take out by the dozens before they are done with their mission.
Your statements reveal that you have some version of libertarian delusion. I hope you will give the matter a few moments of rethinking and will realize that what you said holds no water at all. Functions that benefit the whole society like education, healthcare, and a bunch of other things must be taken care of at the government level. Leaving them to charity is ridiculous. If you belong to a society forget the phrase "I don't want to be compelled to pay for..." Other people's abortion are your problems as well. Other people misery is your problem. Voting to avoid paying for anything but your own grocery bills is beyond selfish, it's misguided. \n\nJust keep thinking, you are not there yet.
Maybe because in Polanski's case every day he was breathing wasn't bringing more death and violence. Some people cannot go soon enough.
How do you think Stalin managed to exterminate 20 mln of "own" citizens? by creating a propaganda machine that made them exterminatable. it's not so hard to do.
62 mln behaved unreasonably. that't about 1/5 of the country. It's not insignificant, particularly since they managed to win as well.
> How is that assertion more valid than me saying that not leaving it to charity is ridiculous? There is no objective standard for what's better.\n\nOnly there is. the problem with your position is that it's based on an ideology, not reality. This is the same problem the infamous founder of objectivism, Ayn Rand, had. Omitting a sizable portion of data from your calculations will give a wrong result. \n\nYour concept of liberty is a phantom. But you don't care. You locked on a simple definition and are satisfied with it. That's why I suggest rethinking the whole thing. There is a lot more data out there that is relevant. It's not your voluntary decision whether other people's problems affect you. They just do, whether you admit it or not. \n\nI hope you are quite young, because reasoning like this as a mature person is just sad.
If they bring those decisions to realization they are responsible for them. No adult should be able to hide behind the words "I was told to do that".\n\nI don't know what compels people to enlist in the military but I notice a glaring lack of those who refuse to kill people or invade countries because it's the wrong thing to do.
My basic assumption is that reality exists and can be understood albeit with significant efforts. Without this assumption all conversations and living itself appears meaningless so I don't plan to challenge it.  \n\nWhile I agree with you that the existence of people with dramatically different views is part of reality and has to be dealt with, I don't find all views worthy of respect. You can say that people who believe that humanity is subdivided into races and conveniently consider their own race superior to others and thus fight for the quality of humanity by not letting people of inferior races marry or even mingle with superior people, also merit sympathy and understanding. Upon careful consideration I conclude that this position causes damage to the society and until some profound changes in circumstances merit reconsidering the whole issue it needs to be put entirely to rest. Abortion debate is exactly in the same league. It's not about the merits of abortion any more, it's about the merits of the conversation itself. I find the issue so clear that it's demeaning to even talk about it.
You cannot be proud or ashamed of being American. THis phrase is a propaganda maneuver  to foster nationalism that benefits noone but the government in allowing to to wag the country by the tail. Technically you cannot be proud of your country of birth any more than you can be proud of your parents. It's not your merit or demerit. You didn't make your country. THe founding fathers could be proud of the country they created but not us. We can be glad to be here or not. But pride comes only with personal accomplishments. Otherwise it's gloating.

I want to see that too.  \n\nThe only thing I can come up with in this desperate situation of people living in alternative realities and refusing to understand or even respect each other is shaming but I am not at all sure it will work. 
Only that's not how it works. Desensitization can be quick, gaining the sensitivity back takes a whole lot longer.
I don't think it would exist without the military. But I also don't think that protecting the country is the same as invading other countries and trying (invariably unsuccessfully) to impose the will of greedy politicians on other nations. \n\nThe US has a uniquely advantageous geopolitical situation which does not require military superiority to survive. The enormous US "defense" budget should be honestly renamed into "domination" budget. 
I am sorry that I made an impression of dismissing ideas. I don't mean too. The format here doesn't allow for a very detailed discussion so some shortcuts (maybe clumsy ones) happen necessarily. \n\nI do find your ideas under-explored. \n\n>in terms of ethics, there is no real, there is only preference\n\nit's just not true. Ethics/morality are direct derivatives of reality. They change as reality changes. For example, before the invention of contraception it was unethical/immoral to have premarital sex.  Babies not protected by a stable family are a liability for the society as a whole and should be prevented as much as possible. Contraception affords people the freedom to have sex without commitments. So it's not a moral problem any more. If a society (hypothetically) foresees a long period of wars and needs lots of males for the army, then using contraceptives at all would be considered immoral. Every baby would be a matter of national security. Your personal preferences have little to do with ethics.  \n\nThere is certainly no collective that knows better than you about what is affecting your life and how. There is no collective that knows anything. It's all individuals who do the thinking and the knowing. Having a pool of intellectual peers produces better ideas than all those individuals can do alone but that is still not collective. People think individually and can use others as resources for personal thinking. I suspect that I am as much an individualist as you may consider yourself. It's the isolationism I find exaggerated. \n\nMy claim is that your profound statements about liberty prevent you from examining the facts as thoroughly as they deserve. So back to the missing pieces. I think you underestimate the importance of family planning. I would not claim so easily that heart surgery is significantly more inevitable than abortion. If heart surgery is not performed the person may die which would be tragic (but not for you necessarily). If abortion is not performed a new human will be created unwelcome, unwanted, possibly doomed to neglect, not to mention the damage to the  life of the mother both in health and psyche and the consequences will be no less tragic. But in this case you are more likely to feel them. When a ratio of miserable, unhappy people around you grows you will not fail to notice. At the very least the crime rate goes up. You may not connect the cause and effect and I am afraid your ideology will actively prevent you from doing so. Ideologies are useful if you can't do better. They are particularly useful to rally up groups of people who cannot do better. You always do yourself a disservice if you use ideology in place of surgical thinking. \n\nIn summary, I am prepared to bet that your basic values are in line with the rest of humanity and it's possible to predict what benefits and harms you to a decent degree. Don't take it as an insult. I might do just that if the real motivation were not clear. I am the last person to tow the line. However, we do belong to the same species and that tells us something. If you are significantly different: breathe CO2 or prefer Mad Max life style, it warrants an early warning. I have no ideology that favors collectivism over individualism. The calculations go case by case, and in many cases maximum individual freedoms are beneficial, however in some cases thinking and caring about fellow humans, close and even far, acquaintances and complete strangers, yields the best outcome for you.
And do what with it? How do you propose to use a gun and what do you expect to accomplish?\nIf it comes to shoot outs between neighbors I just don't see any  point living let alone fighting for anything any more. And what can facing a force of trained professionals with a gun in your hand do other than a quick and hopefully painless death? \n\nI guess some of you are tickled by the possibility of living out your 4-year-old fantasies. However short that living may be.
seriously? how will that help? donate to ACLU and other organizations that fight non-violently while there are still shreds of laws in this country. Contact representatives regularly and tell them what you want. vote in every election and don't let them off the hook after they are elected. canvass if you can. but guns? that will only cause more bullet holes where you don't want them to be.
A small correction: judging by what you said their problem is not that YOU are liberal but that THEY are delusional people who think that liberal is .... whatever crazy stuff they think. They simply have distorted values.  Possibly anachronistic, possibly corrupted by insecurity and greed. Oh, well. It's certainly their problem but unfortunately it has become our problem as well.
It's questionable if even self defense is worth a full war. Wars are so devastating it's hard to imagine any order that would be worse than nationwide military action. THere are ways to target problems surgically instead of putting the patient into the meat grinder. \n\nIt seems that wars always, always have ulterior motives.
well, I also find the term "white people" ridiculous. White people don't exist. Even albinos have a tint to their skin due to blood. And I have never seen a black person. Very dark brown yes, but I am pretty sure humans simply don't come in black or white. 
The ones I know are not intelligent enough to process thoughts of this complexity, and have massive egos to protect. I have lost almost all hope in this regard. 
So how about you and everyone you know in Maine calls her office and demands some walking. It's within your power. takes a couple of minutes a day.
I don't think 100 times is reasonable. IMO the right number is way below that. If you earn 50 times more than the people who lack your qualifications and 10 times more than most people you know, many of whom have about as much ability as you do, you can still feel tremendously ahead. Bigger gaps are not really felt any more. It's pure greed.
All of the above.
nobody says that childcare is only for the rich. It's for people who have kids.  Childcare subsidies in terms of tax deductions are primarily for the rich.\n\nAnd when you say "so little early childhood support" what little support do you mean?
I am in turn hoping that you can appreciate that agreement with a group is not the same as pride. If those words for you mean the same thing then we are at a semantic impasse.\n\n Group pride exists but not for everyone. I have lived in 4 countries and watched widespread national pride in 3 of them and national awareness in one. In all three the pride is meticulously constructed through government propaganda. And still everywhere there are people immune to it. They still care and have opinions about the direction of their country. They can be prepared to work tirelessly for their countries and sacrifice a lot, but they do not experience pride. There is no point arguing about the usage of words but I consider it important to make a distinction. Pride is a useful concept for an individual. It boosts self-esteem and may keep you afloat during tough times. So some people try to scare up some pride where there is none to be found. And they succeed too. I find national pride to be an overall negative phenomenon because it creates a blind agreement and mob mentality. And this is exactly the reason why some governments are keen on maintaining it.
sarcasm?
a noble purpose indeed. something to wake up for every morning.
Please tell Vietnamese, Iraquis, Philippinos and many others that it's ok to invade them when their plans for their countries displease someone as long as propriety is maintained and Britain remains off limits.
do you call that a government? people who have no qualifications besides hating the job. better to have none. Federal government is not really necessary anyway. Every state has its own.
great wealth doesn't come from hard work. It comes from loopholes in the society. THere are lots of people working hard and producing real value and it doesn't bring them any wealth. Wealth is an accident. There is no good reason to hold on to it other than greed. 
Donated to ACLU
other than universal healthcare. You can't pay for medical services out of UBI.
donated today, again. really impressed with these guys.
besides voting we can canvass. I am not a big fan of using money to win votes, that's not what democracy is about.
Sadly, this is not an ethical policy. \n\nI won't give you justifications because I doubt you can come to a realization this late in the game. It is particularly hard to do since your current position is truly unethical and understanding of this fact comes with a certain amount of remorse attached which is painful. I don't wish you pain but continuing in your current mind set is a way more miserable fate. I wish you to grow out of it and become a better person. Good luck!
Do you wake up every morning into the same vile personality or you have alternatives?
you call that Justice? she looked more like Revenge. nobody wants a date with THIS Justice.
We can't tell the terms from the disclosures. There is no reason to do this to hide terms.\n\n>is much more likely than a free loan from the Russians to help them subversively take over America and the world order.\n\nSo how about just debt to Russians making him vulnerable?\n\n
These articles have to get more fact behind them. This could just as easily be a series of loans back around to himself as they could be to a secret oversees debtor. This is a great place to start investigating, not an investigation on its own though.
I agree with you on this.\n\nYou remember when Trump shut down his casinos and was fined 10 million for not reporting the money flowing through the casinos? My theory is that he was helping russians launder money, and the 10 million was nothing compared to what he was getting out of it. Close the casinos, then there is nothing to investigate...\nWhen you combine that whith the talks of removing Russian sanctions, pieces of a puzzle really start to form.\n\nI have no real proof of this, except for the 10 million dollar fine that was paid. I believe that was in either 2015 or 2016, I cant remember.
You would know about snowflakes comrade. Winter is cold in Mother Russia. 
I haven't ever gotten paid for my shilling.  Unfair!
lol, again, not surprised.
What we have is a company he set up so he does not have to disclose the source of the loan.
*slaps forehead*  I actually went "Wow, I never thought of that." out loud when I read your comment.     Why yes I am an uneducated idiot, though still not dumb enough to have voted for Trump. 
Black Sea yacht season is cumming up, he'll be paying back those loans.  One way or another.  Just make sure he doesn't find out that's not really caviar dripping from his lips.
[removed]
If it's Soros that will be a hilarious checkmate.
Exactly. If you wanted to read into everything, I bet Trumps people in New York pass within 5 feet of Russians hundreds of times a day...there could easily be information passing wirelessly between them very securely. 
Oh, you are absolutely right, but it would make sense why he started right out of the gate attacking the intelligence community and trying to discredit them. Something definitely is up, and I hope it gets properly credited or discredited.\n\nI mean, is there a chance it just looks this bad? yes. slim, but there is a chance. Just when someone decides to go at them, they better have their ducks in a row because chances are they will only get one swing.
We know it is to hide the source of the loan. I see no reason to not think the worst of it.\n
I bet there's more than one
Putin 
Damn, someone's a little defensive.
Occam's Razor. The most simple solution is probably the right solution. A perfectly legal loan with really terrible terms (like high interest) is much more likely than a free loan from the Russians to help them subversively take over America and the world order.
I didn't see him cry like baby Trump.
 *cough* Russia *cough*
Exactly. And while no matter what that's sketchy, it's a big difference if the origin of the loan is Russia or if it's another one of his own companies and he's just kiting the money around. \n\nOr maybe it's just terrible accounting...
How much did Russia sell Alaska for? Is Trump cheaper or more expensive?
Anyone remember what the tweet was?
Fuck. even a mummy has more hair than me... 
Chat is your friend for this type thing, for sure
if you ever do research on the disorder, I will sign up to be studied. This mess sucks.
Having just lost my dad in November to a stroke, I really hope your dad gets out and gets healthy! Hang in there, sending positive thoughts your way.
lol\n\nInternet....
I have never bought monster, and i don't plan on it. Of course, back when i used to smoke, i never bought winston.\n\nMy purchasing habits tend to be that if i am buying something, then i will choose the brand that support racing versus just the brand trying to sell items. For example, i don't go to walmart anymore, i go to dollar general when i need to pick up a quick cheap item.
Lol, that was creepy. You should pick it back up, it is good
OK, so why is he not in prison? Did he not, in a debate no less, openly ask Russia to hack the servers to find emails?\n\nregardless what they got or did, there was a public request for them to do it.
I wouldn't say I shit my pants....but I definitely sharted...
You sir, have my vote!
Plus the council is saying "By the way, we're sick of all these disasters. Holes in the sky. Tentacle beasts trying to eat our town? We're going to do something about this, you just wait."\n\nI suspect that is indicating something soon.\n\nPlus, Hagnk has a tentacle for a leg now.
I don't get disruptive angry, but easily irritable. Like right now, I am manic (triggered by a traumatic event a few days ago) and just chewed out a manager at work for disrespecting a young co-worker. I told him I will not tolerate this type of behavior and he better not let me see it again, or else. For context, I am not a manager.... not even in that department. I am sitting here now, buzzing like a high voltage power line like I am coked out of my mind.\n\nI won't sleep tonight, but I will lock myself in my house so I don't do anything stupid. I argue, get irritable, and hypersexual but not violent nor out of control physically. but I work hard at staying on my med plan.
My guess, the 88 car will be driven by Carl. The "pursue things outside of nascar" was to get away from a costly no compete.\n\nJrs test won't be the best, he will step down and the seat filled by edwards, because who in their right mind would turn down a Hendrick seat.\n\n\nJust a wild guess.\n\nDon't get me wrong, I love jr. Just think he has taken enough licks and needs to commentate and start a family before he gets jacked up worse.
44/M I have the exact same issue. first game was pong attached to a magnavox tv, then the Atari 2600, and I was hooked from there on out. The most common thing I see is the patronizing look of "awww still not matured yet, huh?" when they learn I am still a gamer.\n\nYet, like you say the benefits are great. I tend to be a hermit and game a lot after I get home from work. I used to play a lot more socially, had a core group that I would play gears 3 and judgement with. The xbox one came along, and they moved up, while I had to wait (single dad and all)...they moved on, but when gears 4 came out, I had to move up and got the Gears themed console. No regrets. Havent really found a new group of regulars yet. I use mic and headphones, but tend to stay pretty quiet till I get to know the people pretty well.\n\nHonestly, I have never had a truly positive reaction when people around me find out I still game. My daughters boyfriends love it, especially when they think they are going to show me something and they wind up learning, lol. Anywho, I dont really worry about what others think of me, as long as I am happy and not hurting anyone, all is good. :)
I am down for that\n
I have always liked Dogecoin better than LiteCoin, seems to stay more stable. Plus the community is full of awesome people.
Actually, I dont. In my opinion, do not enable 1-click buying so as not to make impulse buying easy. Also, when it is just a want, put it on a list and revisit it in a month and see if you still want it.\n\nBut, if you surf with Bing, and have a microsoft account, you can redeem their points for Amazon cash, and if you are diligent, can pretty much get your prime for free by the end of the year, effectively.
I wish I could afford to guild you!!!!
As a gears veteran, this is great advice. My biggest gripe is reviving someone who constantly runs out just to get killed. Yes, I will do what I can to get you and revive you, but I wont risk the round for it.\n\nThis is a fun game and a great community as long as you dont come at it with a chip on your shoulder and low experience. People will help you and advise you as long as you arent a know-it-all, cocky or annoying.
Yes, I have the car in my inventory and it says it is ready to download, as soon as you tell it to download There is a download error with the market place.
These videos are fantastic and she is a sweetie pie. it is sad knowing she has already passed away. so much knowledge held by the older generations
This is the absolute best route. The only reason he wouldn't give a receipt is trying to do the tow "off the books". if he wants to dispute the charge back, he has to provide proof that he towed you, therefore putting it "on the books".\n\nDo it, it will not hurt your credit either way.
My thoughts was that let a non fan see the best most exciting, then leave them hanging...jonesing for more.\n\nHonestly, I try to think about what would get me to go to, say an NBA or NHL game... Showing the crowd doesnt interest me enough to buy a ticket. Just showing a ball going through the rim, or a quick slap shot doesnt interest me. But, I started watching soccer some because I learned to respect the athleticism through my brother in law.\n\nMaybe a way to teach non-fans about the hard work, and dedication of not just drivers, but somehow relate the amount of skill involved. Anyone that is able to hit the right formula, definitely has a gift.  I know as a fan, you just cant capture on tv that first time walking through the grandstands to see the track for the first time. That feeling of seeing such a large and enormous facility, the awe as your entire field of view is taken over by such colors, smells and excitement. That is my favorite part to watch new fans as they experience it.\n\nAnother thing that I believe would be great, is to find a way to reach out to non fans and offer A deep discounted ticket. maybe a campaign for "introduce a friend" where an actual fan gets the opportunity to get a discounted ticket for a non fan. Figuring out how to do that would be easy by registering a social security number or credit card number or something like that and it would have to be purchased at least a month ahead of time. I am grasping at straws with that because I can see soooo many issues.\n\nWe as a sport really need to get more fans. Like Kenny Schrader said, the long time fans are not who they really need to address. I agree to an extent, but we gotta get young fans, even to the point of a free ticket for kids 15 and under with an full price adult ticket purchased.\n\nHopefully they can hit the target soon, because I don't like seeing them struggle. I will never forget going to the first sold out race at Talladega and the energy that was there. Bristol had a 2 year waiting list for tickets... we need that back.
For me, it is about the style of game and the writing. I have been playing since 2006 and have never gotten bored with it. I enjoy the variety of puzzles and the many things that can be achieved. 
Hell, as a 44 year old, I have been visiting Jayski nearly daily since 1997. Now, I have only been there once since the change.\n\nUntil it goes back to the old format, I am done with it. I dont want to see baseball, football or basketball scores when I am searching racing stats and info. Seriously, they screwed it up badly.
In all seriousness, Suarez has a better shot at the pole than Junior, imho. Gibbs Equipment plus he runs well at Daytona and he has something to prove.\n\nJunior, he won't care about the pole as much as a win. Not saying he won't try.\n\nI hope to see a good race this year and no one gets hurt. This new format is going to be interesting, I am giving it a chance.
My daughter was sexually assaulted last month and we were in the E.R. The boy that did It threatened suicide if my daughter told anyone. Literally as she told me and her mom this, her mom picks up the phone and makes a phone call, in front of my daughter, to try to help him. You could see the hurt and confusion in my daughters face.\n\nHer mom and I haven't been married for about ten years. But I would divorce her for that stunt alone.
Small banks folded... The large banks were bailed out, which is where the term "Too big to fail" came from. Some large Investment institutions folded. You are correct, the bailout did not work that way. It was a much larger and complicated issue, I do understand that.\n\nAlso, I do understand I oversimplified it. but my point is, if the hypothetical used is what you go by, it would be more profitable to take the high risk customers at a 25% return versus the guaranteed customers at 100%.
I have a 06 crown vic with 220,000 on the odometer, I got it at 6000 miles clocked.it was a program car. Still on all original parts (even the spark plugs and transmission have never been changed), except for battery, shocks and brakes. My theory is, it is all in how you treat your car. Drive like a grandfather and it will last longer, the closer you bring it to its limit, the more likely you are to have a problem. Brake easily (unless you have to stop suddenly) and estend the wear of your brakes. Fortunately, I am a mechanic, so I can promptly work on my car when something happens, but generally, if you take care of the small things in time, you avoid the big. With that said, I am about to give my car a tuneup (new timing chain, plugs, wires, etc.). because, I know I am playing with fire right now.\n\nNow, the downside, driverseat and armrest are shot to hell, I am pretty sure the airbags are out of "guaranteed to work" range, and its out dated.\n\nAt 300,000, you can rest assured you got your moneys worth. There are many factors that people don't consider such as ball joints, cv joints, rubber bushings, seals etc that wear, rot and give way over time. unless you can do all this work yourself, at a certain point you are wasting money even if you repair it yourself, unless you are keeping it for sentimental or hobby reasons.\n\nI try to drive a car for 10 years, and have for most of my cars, so I can justify spending 4000 a year on transportation, you just pay it off as soon as you can (and the sooner the better). I usually go with used or program cars.\n\n\nThat is just my take, I know others wont agree, and some will, so, good luck with your decision.
I bought the candle.... Do not regret. I like dipping my fingertips into melted wax....
I have a lot of items left over from past crimbos.... mainly because of this.
Yes, ok, sorry, I see I had gotten off track from the original topic of CC debt, my bad.\n\nYes, you are right, the customers I was referring to are the ones that pay off their cards, but not before racking up tremendous fees. and like you said, banks don't necessarily hurt from them, but once a bad customer becomes a defaulting customer, thats where it gets bad for the bank. I do agree with you, I believe what I was calling a "bad" customer and what your definition is, were two different things. I can see where you would say that any customer that pays their debts, even the late fees, isnt a bad customer.\n\nAs a matter of fact, I am leaving a bank due to the extra fees that keep getting tacked on. The bank I currently am with, I have been with them since 97.\n\nThanks for not turning this into an arguement, I enjoyed the conversation.
That game is awesome. One of my all time favorites!\n
Great theory, but the thing that stood out to me is, if you don't want to be found, but you want to brag about what you did, you would toss out a location as a red herring. At least, that is what I would do.\n\nSay, you set up camp somewhere in polynesia, or micronesia (would stay away from the Marshall islands because of them being American), so you tell people Kenya so no one is poking around close to where you are.... just a thought.\n\nGreat research!!!
Who??? lol
The manual way works good, but you are still at the mercy of the rng for a real good time at the end. I got my Battoo around my tenth try. Fortunately the Battoo skips those that already have it, so you will definitely get it in time.
I don't feel bad for Brian at all. The way they keep trying to "make the sport exciting" is just screwing up the racing. When you manufacture formats, it gets gimmicky. What he is trying to do, he could do it cheaper, less complicated and make more money.\n\nShorten the races to 250 miles, or two hours, whichever comes first. Qualify and race on the same day, and only pay points out to the top 20 finishers. No chase or crap like that. Just race to the end of the season.\n\n\nBrian brought all this mess on himself.
Thanks. Say the things you want/need to say so you won't regret it when you can't. I was fortunate that my dad and I had a good relationship, but I know some guys don't say "I love you enough" to their dads. \n\nI truly hope he makes it, but I hope you don't have regret mixed in with grief.
I agree with that, whole heartedly!\n\nNot just being fun.... They create stories that continue to carry the event as the stage for it. "That time mike, Todd, Steve and I were at the Charlotte NASCAR race in college..." Suddenly, NASCAR races become a rite of passage for college students everywhere...
This is actually a great idea. I would have the gates linked to the class levels, though. That ensures that if someone plays past a certain gate, they have a certain amount of experience with that class.
I believe you misunderstand what I mean by a "bad" customer... I only mean a customer that pays late and pays additional fees and charges. Obviously, no one can do business successfully without customers paying their bills.\n\nThe mortgage crisis is what really crippled the economy in [2008](https://www.thebalance.com/mortgage-crisis-overview-315684), and that was a combination of the lenders AND the borrowers (just because a bank will lend you the money, you better make sure you can afford to pay it back and know the terms). Mortgages were aggressively over lended to customers, by mortgage brokers, where it was a stretch to actually keep up the mortgage, but didn’t care because they were just going to bundle it and sell the debt off to other banks. My personal situation then a bank was trying to lend me 300,000 dollars for a home and I only wanted to borrow 90,000 as I can’t comfortably afford a 300,000 mortgage. I can see where ignorant people would take the loan thinking they could swing it since the bank thought they could. Anywho, literally less than 30 days of obtaining my mortgage, it was sold to another bank. Since then, my mortgage has been sold 3 times to other banks.
Thanks. I was just anxious to get going on it. I picked up both at the same time. And been mainly free roaming
it's all about the base!
I totally agree with this statement.
Because most of the users are like-minded and have the Same sense of humor.\n\nBut, yes, witty usernames are a plus as well.
Lol, "Still trying to figure out which is more believable." FTFY
You get a big thumbs up from me! Clever interpretation. Chad Knaus would be proud😀
I had no idea it was that legendary of a story, I literally had never heard it other than from my aunt. Reading the article, the tale seems to have a long history. The only gripe I have with the article is, why did the writer not reach out to Rolls Royce to see if that was ever done? Though, I could see the advantage for the company to have a "no comment" reply because the legend only sheds a positive light on the company and its craftsmanship.\n\nSo, I guess it is plausable that she shared the story she had heard from someone else and embelishing it, but enough time has passed she forgot the embellishment as well as the original story. I am good with that and satisfied it isnt a glitch.\n\nThanks for linking that!
It's just body language I have picked up over the years, I have no clue what you are talking about in that last sentence, never thought about it that deeply. I am certain you can find a book on reading body language if you are interested.
I agree that some of the puzzles, had you not seen the intro puzzles before hand are darn near impossible. There were a few I came upon that I had to come back to later.
Sorry to butt in, I believe this to be true. When you think about it, the only true thing that can be gained or taken away from life is knowledge. Sort of like when you play a video game... you can build things, buy things, earn money/credits and build things but once it is turned off, all that is left is the knowledge of your experience with it that improves your next experience with it.\n\nEvery existence has experiences to learn from, some greater than others, but none the less there to learn from. Whether you choose to follow the "story quests" and advance or just "mess around" and not advance, is entirely up to you, but each life has certain meanings to learn from.\n\nBefore someone says, "What about a stillborn baby, what could you learn there?", well, if you look from a mother or fathers perspective, the doctors, nurses, relatives, etc., every different perspective is affected by what in a macroscopic view can seem irrelevant or miniscule.\n\nBut, yeah, in a nutshell, I do believe the goal is to learn how to peacefully interact with other perspectives and ideals.
well, at least it wasnt a bad one you can remember. Sending love and warmth your way.
I agree with what you are saying 1000 percent, I was just answering why they are better, not what they are trying to acheive. Honestly, What they need to do to get new fans, is find the people that make fan made commercials and incorporate them to help attract fans.\n\nI work at a printshop and work with a lot of ad agencies. Last year, there was an ad agency working on a Valvoline "comeback" campaign and they were doing photoshoots at our office (old oil cans, posters, racing memerobilia and such) and the kids doing it had no clue what to emphasize. We chatted a little because they were using light tables in my department and they said they really had no idea who this "Mark" guy is. I shared some info and asked about details and all they could say was that Valvoline was looking at a campaign tying in racing.\n\nIn my opinion, if you have a fan who knows what to emphasize, you could get more fans. What I would do in a commercial, is feature the last three laps of darlington between Busch and Craven, Fade to black off of turn four, keep the audio, fade down before you hear who the winner is and put up the words, "You should have seen it live!!!!"\n\nYou give a taste of the excitement, then leave them wanting more.... Dear lord, this is one of those times I really hope Brian France reads this forum... or at least marketing people who have connections.
Amen!!!! To all of that, especially the BOA part. That is a financial predator if I ever saw one. 
'sup girl?!?!?\n\nbut seriously, congrats, you look great and I hope you feel much better as well. Keep the good habits going.
Fake athletes!  So Sad!
I have done this for years. It really adds mileage to them when you can patch and mend things, especially when the tear is "fresh".\n\nA stitch in time, saves nine....literally.\n\nGood on you, plus your sewing looks pretty decent.
As someone who has had a couple of family members that required assistance, I can honestly say that I only hope he is able to have decent conversations with his family and is mentally still "Michael".\n\nAs far as the rest, the guy/girl/scum is selling a peek into an otherwise private situation. More than likely it isn't very telling or exciting. What I mean by that is, my grandmother had ALS and was a quardrapalegic for a couple of years up to the end. If you were to have taken a photo of her in bed, other than it being a hospital bed in the home, nothing looked off. She required no hospital equipment or monitoring equipment.\n\nUsually the photos that sell are usually graphic, embarassing, shocking or inspiring. Normal pictures are usually not bought unless there is a wanted story with it. In this case, the world knows he and his family has struggled and their wishes are to keep it quiet, and so far, everyone has respected those wishes.\n\nI hope that the person trying to make money off of another humans misfortune, well, suffers the same embarrassment they tried to cause the Shumachers.
I actually subscribe to this theory. There are lots of small things that point to this. Granted, someone may explain away a lot of it, but most everyone has had those moments where you "knew" what was about to happen and you make a different decision to change what you know is going to happen. I believe that is due to variants in realities and consciousness bleeding over.\n\nor I could be crazy...lol

Unfortunately, in the U.S. at least, A lot of people don't understand money, or do the math, or look at an offer "down the road". They see 300 dollars now. Which is why there are so many people in credit card debt in the U.S. these days.\n\nI was one of those people. My ex-wife and I wound up with over 30,000 dollars of debt across various credit cards. Once I woke up and started actually learning about money, I realized the cycle then broke it. I got everything paid off and stopped thinking of credit cards as "easy money" but more of "in case of emergency".\n\nThe banks will nickle and dime you to death. They actually make more money off of "bad" customers which is why they tend to encourage that. You really have to look at what items "cost". a $300.00 item paid for in cash is $300.00 plus sales tax (roughly $315.00), but put that same item on a credit card at a 30% APR with a $45.00 activation fee costs $367.88 if you pay off the card that first month. But, say you pay it off and you dont get charged the APR, you still pay $360.00. Always look at total cost rather than monthly payments or justify fees to yourself to make it seem "ok".
Sweet!!!!

Here is what I am wondering. It is odd that the promo came out today... Alex Bowman is driving the 88 in the Clash, where most drivers want the experience for drafting info, if they can race in it. So, did it leak that Jr. isnt going to race the 500, guaranteeing the whole campaign won't lose them money?\n\nWill Junior "discover" in the twins that he can't do it due to the concussion symptoms? \n\nI don't know and I don't wish anything bad for him or his fans, but I would love to see him step out of the seat relatively ok and start a family and enjoy life.\n\n\nI hope for the Jr. fans, Chicago has to refund tickets, but I find it odd how the campagn is Jr. specific rather than someone less likely to grab it but more sensational like a Suarez or Elliot.... don't know, but I do subscribe to r/conspiracy... so that says something...lol
Speaking of conversations, I distinctly remember a conversation with my aunt over 25 years ago. I remember because I was impressed with the story. She is an executive assistant at a large mining company. The story went like this, Her boss had gone to Africa to inspect some mines and had his Rolls Royce shipped there so he wouldnt have to rent a vehicle. While there his rear axle went out/broke/stopped working. When he called for assistance, Rolls Royce sent some mechanics to repair the vehicle over night. Then a month or two later, he calls them to ask why they havent sent him a bill (thinking there could be a mix-up of his location) and they responded with "I am sorry sir, I don't know what you are talking about, Rolls-Royces do not break down".\n\nThis impressed me because of the superior service, then the fact that the mechanics went the extra mile, literally.\n\nI was speaking with my aunt a few months ago and she said none of The CEOs that she has worked under have owned a Rolls Royce. They have had a lot of Lexus, Mercedes, Audi, etc, but no Rolls Royce.\n\nI know I didnt make this story up, because I had no clue at the time you could ship a car to another country (I was young). Crazy man, Crazy

Until he does get back in and drive... Its all just speculation.\n\nI was told by someone who is somewhat close to the situation that he is pretty much done driving (a crew member who works for Gibbs). But, that doesn't mean he doesn't still have value as a sponsor draw, driving coach, p.r. Person and a representative for a company.\n\nI know, if i was him, i would focus on starting a family. He already has more money than he will ever need. The risk is just much greater than the reward at this point.\n\nDon't get me wrong, i am not rooting against him, but your brain can only take so much abuse before it cant heal anymore. He would make a great announcer, in my opinion. Put him in the booth with Gordon and Steve, you would have an awesome trio.... Expensive but awesome.\n\nBut, to clarify, my source still only knows what he sees and hears from the inner circle. Until the rubber hits the road, its all bullshit.

This is an issue for me as well. Mostly, it is because I interpret phrases and body language wrong, or so I have been told. When I am depressed, which is more often than not, I feel like people avoid me and don't want to be around me. I can't blame them because I have done and said some stupid crap in the past.\n\nI too feel like people avoid me because I am not predictable. This is why I am a hermit.

I am so sorry to hear this. You had absolutely no fault in this at all. The worst thing you can do for yourself is "coulda, woulda and shoulda" yourself over it. Her brain had her come to the conclusion that was a valid option, and wasnt thinking clearly, hence, why it is called an illness.\n\nI have been to that point a few times, and have never once thought there was anything anyone could have said or done to back my thoughts away from that direction. It's an unfortunate chemical imbalance.\n\nThe best thing you can do, is what you are doing now, speak out. The more people are aware, the less stigma there is on this illness in society.\n\nI hope you find peace soon and always keep happy memories of your mom in the forefront of your mind. I am so sorry for your loss. Your mom looks like she was fun to be around.
I am 43, and have had that feeling since 13. It's how our brains screw with us. Over the years, I have learned some social cues to monitor to see if I am annoying someone or not. But we can take someone who is annoyed, as they hate us, because our emotions tend to go to extremes.\n\nIf you are talking to someone and their toes are pointed away, they are wanting out of the conversation. If they keep their arms crossed, they are feeling guarded or are not listening. If they keep looking away, or checking the phone a lot, probably time to wrap it up. Also, I have learned, because we tend to talk about ourselves a lot, always, and I mean always, try to end a conversation with a question about the person you are talking to, and let them get the last word. It helps soften any harsh recollections they may have about the conversation.\n\nI have also found that if you actively try to compliment or say positive things to people randomly, not necessarily a conversation, they are more likely to have positive memories and not realize why.\n\nFor example, "Excuse me, I don't mean to bother you, but I just wanted to let you know that I really like the way you look in that outfit," or "Your hair looks really nice today." \n\nPeople will forget what you say, but they will always remember how you made them feel!\n\nDon't listen to your brain when you start feeling everyone hates you, that is all in your head. You will always find love here \nat r/bipolar!\n\n\nGood luck!
Thank you so much for your offer. So sorry you had to go through that mess.
there is a vegan mayonaise named "just mayo" that is great (I'm not even vegan) that you could use as a sour cream substitute to keep the potato from being too dry. Also, look up Alton Browns baked potato [recipe](http://www.food.com/recipe/alton-browns-baked-potato-465254) it is the simplest and best I have ever done.\n\nAlternatively a little chicken or beef bullion mixed in the potato may be enough of a change.\n\nGood luck, I know finding the right combination will be tough, but I hope it will be ultimately worth it when you do.

if they make 1000 off of one bad customer, and 200 off of one good one, then one "bad" customer equals 5 "good" ones. My definition is good pays on time and avoids extra fees. A bad one incurs late fees and carries balances.\n\nJust with that math, if they collect only on 50% of the bad customers, it is more profitable to keep many more bad customers than good ones.\n\nHypothetically, if you had 2,500,000 good customers, that would be $500,000,000 and 1,250,000 bad customers would net 12,500,000,000.\n\neven if only 25 percent of "bad" customers only returned profit, you would make more than the full amount of "good" customers by 1,000,000 dollars in this scenario. The "good" customers are just guaranteed money, but the good money comes from gambling with the "bad" customers, because if the bank messes up, the government will bail them out, so it isn't much of a gamble, really.
Cool idea. Keep in mind the original length and size of the object you are trying to portray. For example, the angle you are attempting, a pencil is about 5-5.5 inches long, so you could make a lump that long to make it look like it is under the skin past the wrist. Keep in mind to keep it straight (no soft bends, only breaks). \n\nGreat job!

I wonder if that Russian spy ship that was reported off the coast has left by now?\n\nSo many times, I have seen people say a variety of the following regarding Trump:\n\n1) Where's the evidence? More importantly, WHERE'S THE EVIDENCE? Where's the proof? Needs proof badly! Show me the proof!\n\n2) There was nothing illegal about what he did.\n\n3) Presidents/Candidates are not required by law to release their tax returns.\n\n4) Presidents/Candidates are not required by law to disclose conflicts of interests.\n\n5) The law is the law! Inaccurately spelled write-in entries don't count in the election!\n\nSo is the Law is the Law is the Law, Law, LAW? And the Rules are the Rules?\n\nNow it is the Left's turn to ask:\n\n1) Where is the Evidence.  Proof, please! Show me the proof!\n\n2) Was the previous administration and officials, if these allegations are true, within their legal rights? Is this a situation where it was Russian officials being monitored?\n\nAnd another important question for me:\n\n3) If the tables were turned, and it was a Democrat that was being monitored, would Republicans be as outraged as Trump sounds now? Or are Democrats not "real Americans" and therefore don't count? This is what the partisan nature of today's American politics has led me to believe that's what at least one person in this nation believes.\n\nIs it something like this?\n\n>The United States Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISC, also called the FISA Court) is a U.S. federal court established and authorized under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978 (FISA) to oversee requests for surveillance warrants against foreign spies inside the United States by federal law enforcement and intelligence agencies. Such requests are made most often by the National Security Agency (NSA) and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). Congress created FISA and its court as a result of the recommendations by the U.S. Senate's Church Committee.[1] Its powers have evolved to the point that it has been called "almost a parallel Supreme Court."[2]\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Foreign_Intelligence_Surveillance_Court

I think they had one post awhile back asking for them.  I don't think it's a good idea to leak that.  Aside from the usual concerns not only is it an invasion of an American citizen's privacy, I'm sure it will give certain GOP factions an excuse to enact whatever agenda they might have with the IRS....such as abolishing it.\n\nBut I honestly don't know what could be in those tax returns that shows anything.  No one has pointed out to me the lines or forms that will tell us a story about what conflicts of interest might be revealed.  At best, I think it will just tell us how much income he had, if he paid taxes, and how much.  And you have to see the whole thing to get a good picture, not just the front page.
> and the fact that individuals were less than honest about said meetings having occurred, especially under oath. So, sorry but the "we got'em!" finger pointing tactic won't work here no matter how hard you believe it will.\n\nWhat do they have to gain by not being 100% forthcoming with their meetings? Why do they have to give the appearance that they're hiding something?\n\nIf it's because they had private discussions with individuals that wanted their conversations to be private (that confidentiality thing with lawyers and doctors), why don't they just say so?
>Why do you know something the rest of the public doesn't know?\n\nI take that as an admission, then.  I'll call Comey.  Would you like some Krispy Kremes while you wait?
I see this in political forums and discussions a lot.  Sometimes the talking points are repeated over and over again.
This is what happens when our lawmakers, including Republicans, put Party over Country and skirt the edges of the Law (or ignore it completely) to protect themselves.  Where they say I DID NOTHING ILLEGAL! without following the spirit of the law, and without concern for ethics.  I hope we put an end to this type of behavior.  It's not healthy.\n\nI have a sense it's a running pattern with not just a couple individuals, but many many more.  This has been going on for a long time.

Now we're going to get innuendo and accusations, having ourselves a Donutgate.
Did he mislead people about releasing his tax returns?
That makes us all invulnerable.  Bumper Bubble Car Clash!
It's my understanding the source article is from 2015.
If there was a law that said he must release his tax returns, he may have chosen not to run until the law was removed.
I'm honestly surprised it has lasted this long.
Are *fake* news sources in your definition pretty much news sites that are made to look legit (example a fake ABC site) but really aren't? Or maybe even just directly make up things, like The Onion, but without the obvious humor value.
It's going to be really bad if some of your heroes, whomever they are, are accused and possibly convicted of that very same or similar thing.
I don't think they're really loopholes.
It would mean he was serving as a true patriot against hostile foreign influence from nation(s) that have not been traditionally our ally.  Calling for anyone that might have such ties to also be investigated.\n\nHis latest Twitter messages have nixed that idea in my mind, though.
Did you read how that statement was worded? How the post essentially de-Americanized you? \n\nI've been concerned for awhile about things now.  I honestly think we may one day see a point where Republicans will try to strip the citizenship of anyone that doesn't agree with them or who they don't like.  \n\nAfter all, being a citizen and voting is 100% a privilege only, right?\n\nAnd if it so happens that means less Democrat voters, so what? For the good of the ~~Country~~ Party!
I'm gonna set up the talking point that it's not technically treason.
Just wait.  Before too long, the Republicans will advocate for basically nationalizing all our businesses.  That is my guess.\n\nDo you think I'm right?
"a part"?\n\nBecause I don't want to be apart.  It makes me sad.
It perhaps depends on your definition of "met," though.\n\nThis has sound so please make sure your volume is not up too high if you listen to it:\n\n>“I do have a relationship and I can tell you that he’s very interested in what we’re doing here today,” Trump told MSNBC. “He’s probably very interested in what you and I are saying today, and I’m sure he’s going to be seeing it in some form.”\n\nhttp://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/donald-trump-putin-relationship_us_589a894fe4b04061313a4660?ir=WorldPost&utm_hp_ref=world

Hey now, we're not so innocent ourselves ya know!
The headline is:\n\n"Audit reveals Army's trillion-dollar accounting gaffes"
If Republicans don't like it, surely they can change the law? Just make sure it isn't discriminatory to one political leaning or another (specifically, don't exclude Democrats from the protection but include Republicans).\n\nWe have been told a number of times, by certain political persuasions, I believe, that if you don't like the law then change the law going forward.
Second statement VERY relevant since you said it was irrelevant.\n\nWas WaPo, at one time, ever considered Fake News? Is it now?
I'm also concerned about organized crime from the Russian spectrum of organized crime.
What lines and forms would be of interest and relevant? Or is it so interconnected you'd really have to have the whole thing to get a good picture?
Everyone keeps bringing up ShariaBlue and Soros and Correct the Record and I STILL haven't seen my paycheck or even know I could get paid to post on Internet forums (no, I'm not really sure that I would do it either).
Nice story, right?
Though they might not be outright lying, I want to know why people within the Trump campaign and administration are saying whatever they have been saying in regards to Russia.\n\nEdit: But I can only spin so far to try to explain.  From the article:\n\n>“Three weeks before Election Day, Donald Trump Jr. left the campaign trail and the country to speak at a private dinner in Paris organized by an obscure pro-Russia group that promotes Kremlin foreign policy initiatives and has since nominated Russian President Vladimir Putin for the Nobel Peace Prize,” ABC reported.
That's an image I could have done without.

If we find out that Wikileaks connected individuals or someone who Wikileaks gave a bump to is now trying to find dirt on these two Republicans, and if my theory holds, then MAYBE I will be more convinced there is something in these tax returns the Kremlin would prefer us not to see.\n\nOtherwise, I still don't see anything that would point to shady ties coming up in tax returns.
Yup, I read about that awhile back! Not that long ago, maybe a month or so.\n\nHere is what Trump had to say about that:\n\n>"I was not involved in that," Trump said on ABC about his campaign's work on the GOP platform. "I’d have to take a look at it."\n\n>"Do you know what they did?" Stephanopoulos asked.\n\n>"They softened it, I heard. But I was not involved," Trump replied.\n\nhttp://talkingpointsmemo.com/livewire/donald-trump-ukraine-crimea\n\nI rather wished I knew where I placed the audio--it might be in my links.  It was interesting.\n\nHere is Manafort denying that Trump Campaign was involved in that ("pushing for the change" I think the quote was):\n\nhttp://talkingpointsmemo.com/livewire/manafort-ukraine-gop-platform\n\nHere is what J.D. Gordon said:\n\n>The Trump campaign's national-security policy representative for the Republican National Convention, J.D. Gordon, told CNN on Thursday that he pushed to alter an amendment to the GOP's draft policy on Ukraine at the Republican National Convention last year to further align it with President Donald Trump's views.\n\nhttp://www.businessinsider.com/jd-gordon-trump-adviser-ukraine-rnc-2017-3\n\nTrump may very well be telling the truth, still.  J.D. Gordon pushing for it "to align with President Donald Trump's views" is different than Donald Trump himself pushing for it.  I could state what my policy on a certain matter is, for example, and then it is up to my subordinates to come up with something.  Note in the interview Trump said "he had his own views."\n\nEdit: Added some sources, reorganization, and things.
Why?
I don't know the law or how it works, but I think it is literally possible they do not.  That may be privileged IRS and taxpayer information, for the most part.

You're right.  It seems really, really weird.

Thank you for this.  \n\nI suspected the talking point would have just been a resurfaced story like about every other scandal Internet people tries to throw Democrats' way.  Maybe we'll get something new.

Long Form, please! We need ALL the forms.
Now please tell me by approximately how many people Trump won by in those states to get their "all or nothing" Electoral vote.\n\nHere's a link of interest: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barry_Goldwater#/media/File:ElectoralCollege1964.svg
You and I are discussing this right now, in real time.
Might he resign before and instead of releasing his tax returns?
No JEB is GOB. He's older. And it's John Ellis Bush compared to George Oscar Bluth. \n\nThe bushes only have a few names George Herbert Walker Bush. George Walker Bush. George Prescott Bush. Prescott Bush. Similar with  the Bluths. 
Me too, buddy. Me too.\n\nObama will come back from the Caribbean, and he'll be like WTF happened here. 
Well we made it through GWB due to Obama so they bumped him up. \n\nObama should be right above LBJ. But trump is in the 40s somewhere for sure. 
Isn't 5.7 really good on A1C?
We are 320 million humans governed by a chimpanzee. It makes no difference for me in my day to day life. I just started to be successful in work and in my personal life. But the primate in the White House is all I think about. 
"So help him God"
I'd say shorting today would have been good timing. 
With who else? They've got Pachulia and Iguodala. They lost Speights Bogut Barnes Barbosa etc.\n\nWarriors had the best starting 5 and the best bench last year. Now they just had the best starting 5 (maybe ever). Bench needs to step up. 
It's the first quarter too. And this is his audition for another team. 
Not to sound old, but there are so many unqualified people on TV now. There are 200 watchable channels. Each has about 20 anchors or hosts. That's like 4,000-5,000 "hosts" or "anchors". These aren't people with Ivy League degrees or even State U degrees. These are some of the dumbest boxes of rocks you can find. And, they aren't even charismatic. My point is, then you get a genuine shyster/troll, and they look positively Kennedy-like next to Schlubette Bumpkin from the local news or Milfy Lowcut from HGTV. Milo has an oversized personality and a smile. Tomi has a scowl and a rant. When you have a schtick, you can succeed in conning middle America. When you're a bland potato on the local news, you're making the conmen stick out even more.
You're 100% right, fleshed out my plan further.\n\nBut, what you're missing is the reason to go to war. The Russians need expensive oil to increase their power. They need us to go to war to destabilize the Middle East further. After the Iranian deal, oil prices went down significantly because there is a larger global oil supply to tap into. This Iran War is supposed to happen in a year, after Russia gets to drill in the Arctic. I'm wondering what happens now.
I'm just being a jerk and I think I'm doing it right. 
Technically true. We cut off our arm. You cut off a hand. 
He's better than Bob Love I guess....
Ask him "Why?" Ask him who voted for Trump's Cabinet or to repeal Clean Water Acts or wants to sell public lands to the highest bidding oil company. 
Keep closing yourself off to people different than you. Very productive. You probably worked on Hillarys social justice campaign. Most people aren't affected by minimum wage or gay rights. But we are all affected by workers rights and populism. \n\nCalling a progressive coastal liberal a racist is silly but my views are only in the context of what is possible in the rest of the country. Ellison and Sanders are great but we need more Petes in the party. \n\nI think you should discuss things with people more in person. Hear the other side rather than throwing everyone in the deplorable basket. I'm a proud progressive but have worked campaigns in Colorado Indiana Chicago and California. They're different. And we need to accept that. 
We're having a town hall, but it's $1,000/seat. \n\nSenator, that's a fundraiser.\n\nWell, those are my constituents.
Those damn extremists like Jim Justice. Lol. 
Didn't neanderthals have smaller brains so we thought they were dumb but really Homo sapiens were the less intelligent and more barbaric of the two?
He's always been overrated but those Bulls teams were underrated and he was the star of two #1 seed teams during the LeBron era. Could have beat them that year he went down. The front office opened the door for a championship. It didn't work out but injuries happen.
Why didn't they trade him to Boston? Or for some pieces that can contribute to a winning team?\n\nDivac is worse than Slobodan Milosevic
Deep Throat was a composite character. He wasn't in the first draft of the book. One of the anonymous sources was Mark Felt, but he wasn't the only one. The circling of page numbers and plant on the porch was completely fabricated, but it made for a better book.
Not how this works. Bush lost ground because it was 3 years since he was elected and the market got wrecked and people were losing their jobs.\n\nRight now, the market is booming and he's at 39. Wait until the market crashes or there's serious national security issues. He will drop then, but not just 1%/week. It's going to come all at once. 
STEVE MNUCHIN WAS THE EXEC PRODUCER OF SUICIDE SQUAD. HOW DO YOU FUCK UP A SUPERHERO MOVIE THAT BAD???
The Clintons aren't black and they've been demonized. If Obama was a black Republican he'd be their hero. 
Is the good reason that McCain is toeing the line for: power. I think it's power. 
Ellison isn't the best person for the job. Pete is. Biggest problem right now is uninspiring candidates like Tom and progressive warriors in deep blue areas like Keith acting like the whole country is urban or coastal. \n\nTo gain back a majority in the House we have to win back the Indiana and Ohio and Michigan seats we lost in 2010. That's why I'm cheering for Pete. 
PwC is in charge of this. 
I thought it said /r/ladiesinsults\n\nAnd I was going to say that Anne Hathaway looks like Sarah Silverman if you replace all the dick Sarah has taken with choir lessons. 
I'm a diehard liberal and I've masturbated to Megyn Kelly. Her whole schtick is the biggest turn-on for me. 
Haha. So youre saying you know the market is overvalued but maybe you can time it closer to the top? 
Do you have something you'd like to share with the class?
Those who serve and protect might kill, but I'm just looking for good judgment. The best judgment of a good police officer or military personnel is to kill the right people and not kill the right people.
Exactly! Came here to say this. When the market's booming and you've got a sub-40 approval, you're deeply screwed. The market will not be perfect for four years, I guarantee that there will be a bump or two along the way.\n\nHe has had the easiest job for this month. Inherited a booming economy and no wars, but he fucked it up anyway. They should have Reagan'd Trump. Have him on TV once/month from the Oval  with a script to hash out a more positive message. Tape everything they can without jeopardizing national security and write good scripts, release it on YouTube, call it 1600. They would have had a popular president in no time. Instead, they are playing alienation politics.
Yeah, in West Virginia...(eye roll)
It was the most impressive 90 minutes of Trump while he's been awake in 20 months.
Buttigieg is the only choice. The other two are a proxy war between Hillary and Sanders. 
LOL at ^ guy who thinks $10k is "a lot of money"
I think it's Elon. I know a close, personal friend of Elon's, and he told me a year ago that Musk would be the first man on Mars. I laughed at him, and this friend said that he has all the paperwork drawn up for when he goes on the mission. It sounded insane, but I think it's going to wind up that he's on this mission instead. 
Remember Obamacare. Remember Joe Lieberman and Collin Peterson. 
Name one democratic senator that approved devos. 
Absolutely!\n\nOddly, I think that we need to get some of the conservative poor to continue strongly supporting Trump, and have them get so pissed off that the global elitist corporatocracy has framed their president. Have them believe it was Pence & Ryan's plan all along to impeach Trump. \n\nI fear that in a year, there will be no one that said they voted for Trump and they'll just erase him from consciousness. He was a Manhattan liberal and not a true conservative....\n\nThey tried that shit with GWB and his father was a Republican president by saying he wasn't a real conservative. \n\n
If the Russians got info on Hillary and Trump, think how easy it would be to get dirty laundry on Louie "Yokel" Gohmert. And, all these fucks might be under the thumb of Russia. \n\nGood luck on all of us getting out of this one. Won't be surprised if some of these guys start committing suicide.
Warren would have won if she went into factories and talked the economic progress. \n\nShe has a good message and I think if she has a laser focus on the economy instead of Trumps an idiot then she could win. 
They need some perimeter defenders. Who is going to guard Cousins and Davis on the Warriors?
Bill Clintons blowjob got him practically disowned by Hillarys team. Here's a man who is a goddamn people genius. Knows what people are thinking and expresses himself so eloquently. Two failed Hillary campaigns because her staffers didn't listen to the former POTUS. Absolutely insane. 
Well, Rubio could help bring down fascism a lot easier than 100 angry constituents can.
I was told this a year ago, and I thought it was insane, but this news might back it up.\n\nThe person who is paying for it is Elon Musk, himself. He's going to pay SpaceX to make himself the first man to do a circumlunar mission. If it fails and he's incinerated then it won't be as bad for space flight as if he incinerates someone else. It will show he trusts his engineers. And, if he succeeds, he's going to be the biggest fucking hero on Earth.  
So, they were 1-4 without him, then finished 8-4 with him including a playoff win on the road, and he's not worth a backup spot?\n\nThe reason was that he was an enormous distraction. You don't want half of your fans calling for Tebow every game. It was more annoying than anything. But, without the cult of Tebow, he would have been a great backup. The goal of a backup is to go 2-2 if your starter goes down, Tebow could have done that.
Tebow was good. He won a playoff game at Pittsburgh. It just got to be too much media for his actual skill set. He was limited and probably was the 25-35th best QB in the league. Not good enough for the scrutiny and certainly not worth it to hold on to him as a 2nd stringer. 
This is like saying that you like a blowjob with extra teeth. 
I worked for Obama twice. Ellison is no Barack Obama. Howard Deans 50-State Strategy is the only way back. Acknowledging differences in the electorate of different districts is necessary to win. Sure there are black and Hispanic Reps in urban centers. But how many Democratic black reps are in rural areas? \n\nBig tent doesn't mean every race and equal amount in terms of gender. It means diversity of opinion and understanding that different districts will want to be represented by different people. We can have Dem Reps that are pro-life or pro-gun but we need to support workers first and foremost in the Midwest. Show them what we offer to put on their table in terms of jobs and taxes compared to the GOP. \n\nWe need to win seats back not redouble our efforts to pacify progressives. The coasts are our biggest asset but let's not allow that to be a detriment to candidates trying to win in Texas or Indiana. \n\n
Started smoking weed a couple weeks ago and since then my back pain has been reduced tremendously and my chiropractor said that my spine is holding better. Might be a coincidence. But I'll go with it. 
This is the People's Budget! All the jabronis in Congress and the millions of voters across the nation know that....{glass breaks}\n\nTHATS AUSTIN! \n\nListen up you sumbitch! I don't care if the marginal tax rate is 35% (what) 30% (what) 25% (what) or 20% (what). All I know is that we need a flat tax rate for all earners at 15%. And that's the bottom line cuz SENATOR STONE COLD SAID SO!
This kinda happened to me. I was showing up 15-20 minutes early and recording the time. I wanted to work 40 hours instead of 37.5. HR called me on it and I had to stop tracking my hours accurately. 
I understand this is a joke. But, by repeating it, it just keeps going. 
Right and there were no Iraqi Nate Silvers during Husseins time in power. Media was State Run and the internet didn't exist. So if you're an Iraqi peasant 3% means that there's no hope to beating Saddam and that you might as well not even try. 
Well they think they're smart and they're at the top so "FUCK YOU!" \n\nI don't know what they're thinking but it's a superiority complex that is put above reason. 
You don't need to live in district to run for the seat. Makes you an easy target but could be dispelled by an effective candidate. 
Fake news. 
Derozan rose over D.Rose
I'm interested to see if this will work again. I think it's been too soon. But it's been nearly 15 years since Iraq's lies. Who knows the possible stupidity of America right now. 
I disagree. Warren would get Clinton and Bernie supporters to unite. Progressive values on economics and social issues, no scandals, and she's a woman. \n\nAlso, a six point deficit of 42-36 is actually a good result when probably 50% of Americans don't know who Warren is. 
There was a slight miscalculation. I re-ran the numbers and we actually can't exist because there is no gravity. The world was a 14 billion year placebo effect. 
I volunteered for a conference as the President of my startup. I had door duty. Quit after a day. Definitely know what you're getting yourself into. 
How are the Pelicans defensively? Can they win some games from the Warriors in the first round?
We need fed govt employee sit ins. Just don't do work that Trump wants. And don't leave if you're fired. Shut things down for a month. 
What did this have to do with debating issues? 
You're describing Pete Buttigieg. He's a charismatic white mayor of a midwestern city. That's exactly what we need right now to win over the people that we're not doing as well with.\n\nEllison is going to be hammered by the GOP as a scary black Muslim. Buttigieg is gay, and the GOP is terrified of pissing off the gays for some reason. This is about winning elections, and focusing on the right areas. We need to win back Congress and I think Buttigieg has the best chance to help us in that sense.\n\nAlthough, the GOP had Michael Steele as Chairman in 2010 and won 60 seats, so.....
Mind you, I don't like his politics, but I love him as a football player. He might not be a great QB, but he really had a compelling story every week. And, giving up three picks, looking back was terrible. But, he was the best college football QB of my lifetime. His resume was incredible. I thought he was going to go #1 overall, but you can't teach a quarterback how to throw. Not going to happen that late. \n\nAnyway, I'm just hoping the Bears don't take Deshaun Watson. That will be a bad pick, and it seems like these top college QBs often don't have their success correlate to the pros. 
I'm pro primarying Feinstein but I don't think she will run again. Feinstein will likely have to run against a Dem in the general because of CA's top-2 voting structure. 
Omg I didn't think about that. They're just afraid to pull the trigger on organizing a real attack because there'd be so much push back right now and intelligence agencies would out them. 
But Israel isn't for the Jews. When the world gets fucked up enough then Jesus comes back. The Jews need possession of Israel for Jesus to come back according to evangelical Christianity. 
Yes that's what he has branded the media. He's basically saying lugenpresse. It's the whole of media that's fake. 
His career winning percentage was over 50%
So this is it folks? This is the date that Elon Musk turns to the dark side. After a failed launch, he becomes a public pariah. Trump begins tweeting against Musk, calling him a dangerous, delusional immigrant. Musk retreats underground in his new lair, developing his plan to destroy humanity and launch himself to Mars. 
You're the captain now.
Donald made a mistake, he could have deported the Mexicans/Muslims, built a wall, and lowered taxes. But, when you commit treason first, then the agenda gets much harder to enact.\n\nThis is a huge news story, and I fear it gets worse. 
Just like those Trump pivots to being a normal candidate/president. 
CALL Robert Langdon!
Kremlin Kraft
Bad leadership from the top. I'm still confused on what the mission statement or purpose of ESPN2 is. But now I'm confused what ESPN's mission statement or purpose is as well. 
What if I want no permanent damage done to KD but I want to see him get hurt before the playoffs for the next 2 years. 
I think about this scene all the time in relation to Trump. Glad to see there's a GIF. 
Economic justice rather than social justice. Manchin is a proven winner and he represents WV well. Let's worry about Dems more conservative than their voters.
Derozan rose over D.Rose.
Only way Putin can profit from his oil reserves is if we destabilize the Middle East. \n\nBest way to do that is to go to war with Iran after Bannon and his gang plant a false flag terrorist attack by an Iranian immigrant. 
So, then what will Trump do? Not pass tax cuts until Bannon gets all of what he wants.\n\nSo, now we have "leaders" in Congress waiting for their agenda, while Bannon institutes a white supremacist dictatorship. Let's see who budges first.
They'll toss him overboard if they lose the House. Dems will investigate him nonstop. \n\nWe need Ossoff to win the GA special election for Prices seat. That will scare them senseless. 
So one democrat from West Virginia (which Trump won by 30) is that bad. Doesn't make the parties equal. 
One time I made my friend laugh so hard at a restaurant that he threw up in the middle of the meal. Luckily it was brunch on the patio so it was hilarious and not awful. 
Only reason I thought Hillary might lose is because of Martha Coakley losing twice in Massachusetts. 
Oprah. 
They have some plans, but they're so bad at executing on the plans, it's amazing.\n\nBut what happens when Trump is close to going down for treason? Won't he just nuke everyone? 
Retards?
I spoke with Espn's current CEO and one of their C-level people during the early 2000s. \n\nThe difference is that espn used to have other programming and sports center was a flagship. 5 pm and 10 pm (central time) was locked down with SC. Now check your listings. I believe SC is on 16 hours a day! That's fucking lazy! And the rest of their programming is either live college bball or off-season football/baseball. It's nuts. \n\nCurrent CEO said that they are trending towards younger and more diverse anchors. Which is great if the network wasn't run by old white people. The pandering is so obvious that it's pathetic. Tmz sports can be ESPN1. But make espn2 back into old espn. Show old games and put John Clayton and Jaws and Gruden on a playbook show. They are so lazy because the money still comes in. But they aren't doing anything to advance sports entertainment. 
His superpower is that he has no shame. You can get away with anything as long as you're rich and don't apologize. 
Ah. Type 2. Got it. 
Also they don't rig the votes they rig the counting. So if it's 100-0 and you voted against then you'd know something was wrong. 
So you're saying we're invincible....?
I get the need, the desperate need, to hide what he actually says. But the topic is Rand and the ACA and his actions regarding it. This is not Rand's "good side", this is Rand grandstanding for the press. 
That does explain your other responses. You seem to defend Paul's comments simply on the basis that he is Ron Paul and therefore didn't say anything wrong. That makes it a cult of personality.
The difference is that VW was making money and so can pay the billions in fines.\n
> Regardless, ACA did nothing to address the 9% annual compounded growth rate of medical costs.\n\nActually it has. Between the ACA and Medicare pushing electronic records and such they have helped contain costs.\n\n>Real ground will be made when we can reduce the compounding and actually get medical costs to 3-4% of GDP like they historically used to be.\n\nTrue, but that is an entirely different set of issues.\n\n>Enforcing existing laws regarding collusion, price-fixing, etc. would reduce medical costs 50% virtually overnight. \n\nI'd love to see support for that claim. Hell, a 10% reduction would be amazing, 50% is fantasy land.\n\n
I talked with someone who said his objection to Obama was how he enriched himself as president. The example given was Obama's "luxurious" Hawaii vacation. I pointed out the expense to keep Melania in NYC. The guy disappeared.\n
Does Rand publish all of his work product?\n
Apparently Hillary Clinton was smart enough to have a massive fraud campaign and not smart enough to deal with the email server.
> Explain to me why if you have insurance that your EoB (Explanation of Benefits) often show 50-70% reduction in the bill (e.g. "Negotiated price")? \n\nBecause there is no meaningful relationship between the bill and the payments. Reducing the bills by 50% won't do a thing to *costs*. The bill is not the cost of the services. The *payments* relate to the cost of the services.\n\n>Why do you have to pay tens of thousands of dollars in insurance premiums for this "special price?"\n\nWhat do you think Heinz will charge me if I want to buy a bottle of ketchup? I bet I can get it cheaper from Costco. The free market is full of price negotiators, of firms that group together buyers to lower the end price.\n\n>Why can't you comparison shop? Most medical procedures (such as MRIs) are not emergency (thus subject to availability), yet it's near impossible to get pricing in advance. Why is that?\n\nThat is not an easy question. Unlike an efficient market health care has a radical disparity in information. The doctor knows a lot more than the patient. Nor do patient show blindly for *procedures*, they shop to solve conditions. And once you develop a relationship with a doctor there is a large cost to shift to another doctor.\n\nAnd then you have the continuity of care issue. I see doctor A who recommends procedure X to solve condition K. I have doctor B who does the procedure. K is not solved. Is the problem that X was the wrong procedure or that B did it wrong? B will point out they were not asked to diagnose and recommend, just to perform. Medical care is not a series of disconnected procedures.\n\n
> My comment was ONLY intended to point that it is sensationalist to suggest, as the article's title did, that Nunes was threatening reporters.\n\nHe did threaten reporters. He did say that investigating Flynn is the same as investigating reporters. \n\n\n\n
Here where you don't want me to talk about him.\n
If so so what?
So all or nothing, right? Either we do nothing or we police everything. There is no possibility of a reasonable middle case where we protect where our interest lay.  And this has nothing at all to do with RT giving RP his soapbox.\n
> Many people use Deuteronomy 22:5\n\nHow can Christians use that as law and ignore so many other laws?\n
They are both so damn boring.\n
> I can see why they made it though. \n\nTo avoid law enforcement, to obstruct justice, to enable their illegal activities.\n\n
Both apparently wanted the U.S. to stop helping Ukrainians resist Russian aggression.\n
Redditsionage
I happen to like, in theory, some aspect of the Nepalese/Dali Lama system. They take a child and raise it from birth to have the skills and goals to lead. It is a nice idea: you get someone dedicated and able. In reality there are so many potential problems.\n
Worked with the Russians? Violate the constitution by taking money? Change his policy on One China in exchange for his company getting a trademark in China? \n\nBut if you refuse to look you won't see.\n\n
> Ron what the fuck are you doing? \n\nRT gave him a platform to attack the U.S. for years now. He is repaying the favor.\n\n>Did the DEEP STATE hypnotize Sessions into saying false shit in front of the Senate? He fucking lied, dude. He perjured himself on a question that wasn't even designed to trip him up, because he's a retarded hick from Alabama \n\nHe lied because he is covering something up. And then lied some more. He claimed that he met with the Russians at the convention as a senator. Yet he paid for the trip with campaign funds. Apparently he magically turned on his senator shield in the middle of the meeting.\n\n
Does it matter where he hides his work product?
He has released all of the details of his bill?\n
Libertarians keep tell me this is the solution to high health care costs. We need to get rid of that artificial monopoly created by licensing. Let anyone practice medicine and the market will get rid of the bad actors.\n
How is that better? Flynn was working for a political campaign. Flynn was working on behalf of the president elect. Flynn has resigned, but you support going after reporters. \n\nOr are you buying the lie that the problem was that a private citizen talked to Russians?\n\n
What? You have to explain what you are thinking because it isn't obvious what you are talking about.
What is it so far? 20 years, 10 seasons, and at least half a dozen episodes. (British TV is weird.)\n\n
Those were the parts I particularly liked.\n
Illegal? How so? If and when they hold a hearing on the bill there will be something to see. And if anyone writing the thing wants to show it they can. The issue is that they don't really have anything to present. I don't get what law you think should exist.\n
Keep avoiding Rand's actual actions and words. The fantasy Rand is a great guy.\n
If by "fighting back" you mean committing crimes, sure. It is called obstruction of justice and this is going to cost them a whole bunch of cash.
I was just giving a rather famous quote from a philosopher on this issue.
What is not legal about deliberately evading law enforcement? Does the term obstruction of justice mean anything?\n\n
Do you think Moses is not relatable?\n
No, I mean the *content* of the bills as they are being discussed. Work product. Like the House bill that they are working on but not ready to make public. I am sure that as soon as Rand says anything or writes anything he makes it public.\n\n
Sorry, but other than their enabling Russian aggression how is Flynn and Sessions not a "warmonger"?\n\n
He is saying that McCain wants to investigate Republicans and that is a bad thing.\n
If Russia did try to subvert our election they are our enemy. They have certainly committed cyber warfare against us. Working with a foreign power to subvert our election is treason. And we can't find out if we don't look. But Rand says don't look because the potential guilty parties are Republicans.\n\nAnd you swallow that bullshit and complain about me.\n\n
I'm not sure what you want in terms of advice. You find out, you tell her. Give yourself a few hours to just process the feelings on your own, then tell her in private safe place for the two of you. The how her is not particularly special.
And taxi companies have been called out for those things. 
It is directly relevant as it speaks to Rand's priorities regarding the ACA. He won't investigate potential criminal actions since that would hurt Republicans. But he will grandstand for the press since that helps him.\n
They were already talking about them. Rand just made it clear that cops using armed drones was fine.\n
Well technically yes. Actually, just yes. I've got a brain cloud.\n
*American Crime* is astounding. Each season (2 so far, 3 starts soon) follows a crime and how it affects people. The cops play almost no role and the show is not about who did it. Rather it is about how the lives of the people involved are affected. It is an ensemble cast, the same actors play different characters in each season. It is intense and fascinating and has fantastic acting. 
Very little post RotJ until after Ep IX...
>  First, you are not obligated by law to pay a third party to help negotiate your ketchup price.\n\nThat is really stretching things. The disconnect between costs and bills existed long before the ACA, the two have nothing to do with each other.\n\n>Second, lots of other firms can sell and make ketchup provided the meet reasonable safety standards. \n\nI don't see how that is at all relevant to your complaint. That is a different set of issues to be discussed separately. The point remains that there is nothing inherently wrong with an aggregator or negotiating agent.\n\n>For medical providers,\n\nYou need to make an argument in place. If you want to talk about something else do so. But restrictions on who can practice medicine have nothing to do with the disparity between medical bills and payments.\n\nRemember that you claimed you could drop *costs* by 50%. I'm still looking for how you are going to do that. Removing those who do price negotiation is not going to drop costs.\n\n>There are existing laws on the books that, if enforced, require disclosure, prevent price discrimination, and reduce monopolies -\n\nYou keep saying this. What price discrimination do you see as illegal here? What monopolies are you talking about?\n\n>Now your last point about a doctor "knowing a lot about a patient." That's not the case anymore and you know it.\n\nIt is true and you should know it. Yes, *Medicare* has really pushed for the use of electronic medical records. (Yes, that is why they have become so prevalent.) But the record is not all there is. First, doctors *in general* have information not available to patients. Second there is more to your relationship with a doctor than you can find in the record. And third switching doctors frequently (the only way you will get some market movement on prices) means doctors have to spend a larger relative amount of time learning about you. Which drives costs *up*.\n\n>If I have a broken wrist, 9/10 it's pretty predictable the treatment.\n\nUnless this is suggestive of a balance problem.\n\n>In fact, most treatments follow standard procedures of care. \n\nYou keep ignoring diagnosis.\n\n
Who was blaming the drivers?
They are when they try to subvert our elections. But don't worry: Rand will protect what matters, he fellow Republicans.\n
What does it change? "We are not going to listen to McCain, not when it means having to investigate Republicans." Yeah, it is still a craven coward who puts his party above his country and above the law.\n\n
>I am not in any categories of people she hates, should I really be concerned?\n\nLook at that sentence three times. Say it out loud. And decide what kind of person you are.\n\n
It would be interesting if anyone answered or responded with anything except they don't like the number. 
They have a short window. They need to do it this year or they are screwed. If they wait for the 2018 campaign season to start the Democrats are going to run on "Impeach Trump" and hang him around their necks. 
> Yes, as a sitting member of congress as part of his committee duties.\n\nSo what? He *lied about it* under oath. So the question is why did he lie. He lied so he thought he had something to cover up.\n\n>No one was trying to hide anything. \n\nYet he lied under oath.\n\n>You're trying make it sound like he met with Russians in disguise and under the cover of darkness on Glienicke Bridge.\n\nNo, I'm making it like he lied under oath.\n\n>No, his position is that the era of "it's not the nature of the evidence but the seriousness of the charge" is over. Unless someone wants to come forward with some serious evidence of wrongdoing there's nothing to investigate.\n\nRand said don't investigate because the target is Republicans. We have plenty of evidence to *start an investigation*. Like the rest of the Republicans you say we should not investigate unless we have enough evidence to convict. That is not how investigations work. Remember, these guys had 5 different committees investigate Clinton over Benghazi.\n\n>BUT HE MET WITH THE RUSSIANS!!!! \n\nYes, you Republicans try that as well. You act like people make a different accusation. There is a *different* point that there is a whole lot of contact, often covered up and lied about, between Trump and the Russian government. This is not limited to Trump asking the Russians to interfere with the election but extends to a host of contacts including his company lawyer using Flynn to deliver a Syrian peace plan. Given that Sessions lied about talking to the Russians that is one more piece that says we need to look into this to find out what went on.\n\n\n

>I am easily amused. \n\nAnd there is the secret to Reddit's success.\n
Since I was making fun of British TV production I didn't bother to look it up. Hell, AbFab is still "in production".\n
I think that museums make for great dates. You have something to distract and something to talk about. Art in particular lets you have conversations that help you learn about each other.\n\nThe museum is off Fairfax. There are lots and lots of places on Fairfax. Which direction are you coming from?\n
They may be trying this, but it is not deflecting. It just intensifies things. These tweets make it look like Trump does not yet understand he is president. He said "Is it illegal ..." That sort of implies that Trump does not know and can't find out. Then he talks about a smart lawyer,  basically saying that Trump does not have access to a smart lawyer.\n\nThis is not a deflection, this is Trump declaring his inability to deal with things. Someone out of power could try this to push the FBI to investigate. Trump is not out of power. It is his FBI that is not acting.
> Why doesn't he just "join" your church? At least fake join so you don't lose your family...\n\nIt is a cult and cults don't do fake joins very well. 
> That's a bit of a stretch given the context of the questioning. \n\nQ: did you have contact with the Russians.\n\nA: No.\n\nHe lied under oath.\n\n>It's clear that a) he had met with Russian officials because it's part of the public record \n\nNo it was not. \n\n>b) that there was an implied (if not outright stated) "as part of the Trump campaign/administration" during his questioning.\n\nWhy? Of course now he even denies he was part of the campaign. But why was that thing that was not said at all somehow part of the question?\n\nQ: Did you have contact with the Russians?\n\nA: Only in my role as a senator on the intelligence committee. We never discussed anything at all to do with Trump or the campaign.\n\nSee? An honest man not trying to cover anything up would have given a full truthful answer.\n\n>Yet despite multiple requests to point us to that "evidence" you have failed to do so and just keep sputtering "EVIDENCE!!!" like a spastic parrot.\n\nSeriously, are you not reading anything except RT and the Washington Times? Are you saying that Trump and Flynn didn't have contacts? Anyway, start here:\n\n[The 3 Trump-Russia Sacandals Explained](http://www.vox.com/world/2017/2/15/14620560/trump-flynn-russia-campaign)\n\n[Donald Trump's Russia Scandal Is Just Getting Started](http://foreignpolicy.com/2017/02/14/donald-trumps-russia-scandal-is-just-getting-started/)\n\nYou can then move on to this story which sounded outlandish at first, but seems more and more real:\n\n[What We Know and Don’t Know About the Trump-Russia Dossier](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/11/us/politics/trump-intelligence-report-explainer.html?_r=0)\n\n[U.S. intelligence warned Trump about Russian 'perverted sexual acts' blackmail, report says](http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/russia-compromising-information-trump-report-article-1.2943045)\n\nThen more to some important deep background material, the kind of stuff you *investigate*:\n\n["Says Who?" - Piecing Together the Michael Cohen Story](http://talkingpointsmemo.com/edblog/says-who-piecing-together-the-michael-cohen-story)\n\n[What The CIA and FBI Knew About Trump Before 2016](http://talkingpointsmemo.com/edblog/what-the-cia-and-fbi-knew-about-trump-before-2016)\n\nOr you can demand that we have all of the evidence before we start looking. Or try tossing out more insults, maybe that will look like a valid argument.\n\n\n
> Sessions actually denied it yesterday\n\nHe admitted today that he spoke to the Russians. Nice try.\n\n>My position is to only investigate if there's some sort of proof. \n\nAh, investigate after you have all of the evidence. What exactly does investigate mean then?\n\n\n
Yes, yes it is.\n
They can't drop you, they can simply refuse to renew the policy.

> My argument is that the ACA never addressed the underlying cost drivers \n\nIt was not primarily focused on that. \n\n>Now, I pointed to several examples on how you can contain costs. \n\nSome did, some didn't. Again, changing the difference between billed price and paid price does not affect the costs. There is a problem  where the negotiated prices have gotten very far from the "standard" prices, but costs are still a different issue. \n\n>Why does medicine in Europe cost a lot less? If insurance was doing what it was supposed to be, wouldn't the prescription costs be comparable?\n\nNo, insurance is a different set of issues. Yes, if the Republicans have not prevented Medicare from negotiating the way insurance companies do it would reduce the prices. \n\n>You can't have collusion and expect price negotiation.\n\nWhat collusion?\n\n>The AMA reduces the number of doctors who can train in the US. \n\nNo they don't and the AMA does not have a monopoly on who can be a doctor.\n\n>There are a variety of regulations on who can treat you (seeing the increase of Nurse Practicioners for minor things is a good sign) - some are legitimate, others are simply barriers.\n\nYou are going to have to show that the barrier issue is significant. I am sure there are problems here and there, but I like the idea that a doctor has to prove they have some basic competence.\n\n>The FDA has been noted on several occasions of not permitting various drugs and devices not used in Europe because they caved into pressure by businesses with competing technologies.\n\nI'd like examples of the FDA doing this. But even so if you don't have some IP protection you don't get the research investment. Yes, the FDA prevents things from being sold, often because there is no evidence they provide any value.\n\n>Oh hell, the FDA even had the big give-away of giving patent rights to long-existing drugs that never had more formal safety studies done, but were known to otherwise to be safe and effective. Now old drugs that were pennies on the dollar are now dollars on the dollar.\n\nHow did the FDA do this?\n\n>Doctors, if you're lucky, spend 15 minutes with you. \n\nMy wife's doctor regularly spends half an hour talking about details of her care. \n
>Have you ever thought that it makes no sense, because it's literally conspiracy bullshit taken from a "source"\n\nWe have lots and lots of sources.\n\n> Look at what the AP just said about the sessions incident... There's no evidence yet. \n\nExcept that he has admitted that he talked to the Russians and we know that he lied about it.\n\n>You can't keep investigating members of the administration every time some lefty makes a claim about Russian ties with no evidence. \n\nSo basically your position is like Rand: you don't investigate Republicans. \n\nNow can we have yet another investigation of Benghazi please.\n
I can't: Rand and the rest of the Republicans refuse to investigate. It would be an interesting legal system where you refuse to investigate until you already have proof. \n\nI'd like a tiny bit of integrity, from Rand or other Republicans. They had at least 5 separate committees investigate Benghazi and there was never any hint of criminal action or treason. How about a tiny bit of that the Trump/Russia interaction? Or at least how about they come out as a group and admit the only goal of the Benghazi investigation was to attack Clinton's candidacy.\n\n
"Treason against the United States, shall consist only in levying War against them, or in adhering to their Enemies, giving them Aid and Comfort."\n\nI think that working with a foreign enemy power to subvert the American government is treason. I think it needs to be impartially investigated. Rand thinks we should not investigate Republicans.\n\n
If you don't look it does not exist. That is the basis of this administration.
Right. That the standard now has to be proof before you get started. I see enough *evidence* of the existence of crimes that we should investigate. As in a real investigation by a special prosecutor.
The issue with the Japanese internment camps was that American citizens were interned.
Not sure why I expected anything besides a deflection from a 'pede.\n\nWay to completely puss out addressing your own hypocrisy. 
> I am literally talking about their ability to impeach him. They have to prove it. \n\nAnd for that we need  investigations. We already have more than enough for a Republican House to impeach a Democratic president. The question is whether they will have enough public evidence for the Republican House to start an investigation. The 2018 Democratic slogan is going to be "Impeach Trump - Vote Democratic" and they may well take the House with it.\n\n>I'm not going to be one of the dumbasses that scream to impeach Trump, when the truth is that we aren't privy to the information needed to convict him of a high crime or misdemeanor. \n\nSo until there is enough to convict you oppose looking for more.\n
“A foolish consistency is the hobgoblin of little minds, adored by little statesmen and philosophers and divines."\n\n
He is not a Republican.
Sure. If it creates a black hole and destroys the Earth (which it can't and won't) then when you die you would find out. Other than that your prof gave you a silly assignment. So explain that.\n
>I was brought up in a religion that is very strict to certain or "most" things. NO sex before marriage, NO living with your boyfriend before marriage, NO cursing, OH and the worst one of all, DO NOT date/marry anyone outside of the religion.\n\nThose are classic cult rules. Controlling sex and reproduction. \n\n>Now that you have the background info, I can explain my current situation. I am dating someone outside of my religion. A religion that I find myself only being “half way in”. \n\nThey are not going to allow that. You know that. Not only that but if you go back they are going to distrust you and make sure you can't even think of straying. You are a danger to the cult.\n\n\n\n
On of them? We know that foreign dignitaries are staying at his hotel. So that is a violation of the contract and the Constitution. We know that Trump said he was going to reexamine the One China policy. Then his trademark was announced. Then he said he supports the One China policy. \n\nAnd the point is that you investigate before you have "proof". It amazes me that people want to lock up Clinton when the evidence says no crime and want to wait for utter absolute proof before investigating Trump.\n\n
> Call a lawyer and have the lawyer negotiate a deal with him. If he doesn't fully cooperate, meaning paying you $200 per person he signed up and he doesn't turn over the email list and sign paperwork guaranteeing that he will never contact any old customers, you get his ass thrown in jail.\n\nThe legal term for that is extortion. It is also a disbarable offense. You cannot use the threat of jail in a civil matter.
There is a small problem with this fantasy. If Trump wanted to investigate he could. No need to whine on Twitter. If Trump wanted to know if something were legal, he could ask the FBI. If he knew a smart lawyer he could have nominated him for AG. These tweets are from someone who does not understand that he is the president. \n\nAnyway, you can't simply go after the ex-president. You have to have some evidence somewhere that he was in fact involved. \n\nBut hey, let's see Trump proclaim that it is appropriate to investigate a president.\n\n
When you demand that Democrats have the proof already. Not simply evidence but full proof.
> Actually, that's the first time you've posed that question\n\nNo and you have avoided saying why Clinton's "lie" matters.\n\n>The answer is because Russia's impact on the election was minimal if at all. \n\nAmazing how you already know that. No need to look. I mean just because Trump  asked them to get involved and they did get involved in nothing to care about. \n\n>His political positions?\n\nI mean the lies he made as a candidate. Which don't bother you.\n\n>She has no responsibility to the CIA.\n\nYou don't seen to know how government works. Again: the CIA gave the talking points. \n\n\n>The reason it's important to me is because Hillary screwed up on Libyan security\n\nIt was a *CIA* base and operation. Not an embassy.\n\n>and the Obama administration was desperate to not have "radical Islam" as the boogie man. \n\nExcept for, you know, their drone strikes and all that. \n\n>She is still partially on the anti-Muslim video narrative so she can blame the west for the attack \n\nWTF?\n\n>But seriously, there is yet no evidence to show Trump's campaign in collusion to Russia, \n\nOther than the evidence we have. Like Sessions lying to cover up a meeting. Like Trump's company lawyer preparing a "peace plan". Like Trump's advisor working for the Russians and then Trump changing Republican policy on the Ukraine. How much do you want? That's right: you don't want any and we should not look for any.\n\n\n\n\n\n
They engage in illegal behavior. They engage in sexual harassment. 
Just that they are theft.\n
How many obstruction of justice charges will this produce? Will anyone have the  guts to RICO them?\n
How does that context change a thing? 
> You're the one who calls people who don't arm foreign nations, or wage foreign wars "warmongers".\n\nNo I am not. I'm calling those who want to encourage Russian aggression warmongers. Russia can also engage in war you know.\n
We will see.
Spoken like a True Republican.\n
Investigate what? Were they looking into a foreign intelligence issue or a crime?
Does Ron do anything these days except defend Russia? 
Huh?\n

Jorge Lanata, the journalist who [originally broke the story](http://www.lanacion.com.ar/1958082-revelan-que-trump-le-pidio-permiso-a-macri-para-hacer-una-torre) is actually highly respected. You clearly don't know what you're talking about.
Cool, tell the artist.
And again he deflects to Hillary. You're a huge fucking pussy, bro.
Skinned digital bones with something? You clearly have no idea what you're talking about. What you're complaining about is the rendering engine.\n\nAnd last I checked Mass Effect Andromeda wasn't out yet, so I'm not sure how you can claim the artist was "finished."

What's strange to me is that you think you're posting in good faith. Your first few responses were simply "Nope." You think that's posting in good faith?\n\nThe president potentially abusing his power for personal gain is not partisan nor something to scoff at. It matters. It affects you.\n\nYou say you respect dissonance, get some.
You could still fix it in post. Freeze frame the cube as long as you can, then work a handful of frames on either side of the impact point.
Tell me about it.\n\nAll those people that had their panties twisted over paid speeches and private email servers suddenly don't care that Goldman Sachs executives are in the white house and the new administration is using private email servers. How about a little consistency, amiright?
I'm not understanding how the fact that Trump even brought it up doesn't concern you at least a little bit.
WE'RE ALPHA MALES THAT'S WHY WE GET SO OFFENDED
You're completely avoiding the fact that his business failed. \n\nGood businessmen don't have their businesses fail in the first place.

I don't understand what point you're trying to make about character design.

I like your park.\n\nIt feels like a large majority of posters here just design cities instead of playing the game and growing them. How accurate is this?
And a doorman that always high-fives children of divorce
Just because he not directly managing it doesn't change the fact that he's not separated from it and you're completely wrong.\n\nThere is currently a lawsuit being bought against him for violating the emoluments clause in the constitution.

OK. That's still doesn't make it little.
Sorry I wasn't PC enough for ya.\n\nDon't call people immature if you can't handle when people dish it right back.
That's because all the Russian propagandists have moved onto getting Le Pen elected.

>If I were worse, I would've already posted about you being mean and hurting my heart, blocked you somehow, reported you, and stopped arguing a long time ago.\n\nYou have posted about me being mean. You literally just did it.  And don't pretend like I didn't get under your skin, because  otherwise you wouldn't keep coming back like you have something to prove. \n\nYou should have just taken note when your own hypocrisy was pointed out to you and moved on. Instead you chose to deflect to Hillary multiple times and be self-righteous.\n\nIn addition to doing all the things SJWs do, it has to be pointed out to you that you are doing these things because you possess absolutely zero self-awareness. That's what makes you so much worse.
I made it sometime last year. I don't remember exactly where I saw the original image. I think it was /r/TheSquadOnPoint.
That's exactly what I'm talking about. To you it's "bullshit" when a liberal gets paid to speak to bankers, but when Trump puts bankers in the fucking White House you're "not in complete support."\n\nAnd then you spout off about hypocrisy? Get real bro.
Yea, and he still is a businessman. He still owns and profits from the Trump Organization. Now he is using his position to leverage his business like in Argentina. \n\nHe is still putting himself first like he always has, not America like he is claiming.\n\n[1](http://thehill.com/policy/finance/307050-report-trump-pressed-foreign-building-project-in-congratulatory-phone-call)\n[2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Trump_Organization)
Present some reasoning for me to understand. All you've done is deflected or made an excuse for literally everything I've said. \n\nWhy should people not care that our president might be abusing his position for personal gain?
No I didn't. I chided you for complaining about hypocrisy without addressing your own.
Like I said, huge fucking pussy, and sadly exactly the same as all the other 'pedes masquerading as righteous.
Your account is barely 3 weeks old. The fact that you have the audacity to accuse *anyone* of being a shill is laughable.
Holy shit. I literally just said you were masquerading as righteous and your response is "Look how righteous I am?" BRUH\n\nYou're a fucking dumbass who needs to be told he's a fucking dumbass because your *astonishing lack of self-awareness* prevents you from reaching that conclusion on your own.
I can't tell if this is satire or not.
Nobody is forcing him to manufacture everything overseas and import immigrants to work at his resort. If he truly wants to help American workers, why has he been not been doing that the whole time?
Neither of those things are character design.
NO PUPPET! NO PUPPET! You're the puppet!
The President potentially violating the constitution for personal gain absolutely does matter, and nobody in their right mind thinks otherwise.\n\nAre you just trolling now or what?
I was just responding to your sarcasm with more sarcasm. No need to get upset.
I take it you don't have insurance.
It's the same video as the OP and it isn't even a minute long. \n\nThe fact that /u/greatwhite8 needs to have his hand held this badly is pretty embarrassing.
How can you possibly assert he's just making it all up? Do you not realize how ridiculous that is?
THEY STARTED IT!
And the MSM is too scared to report it! That's why we can only trust Infowars!
Another day, another Clinton post.
So the president of Argentina is just making it up and the history of the two of them scratching each other's backs in the preceding decades is completely irrelevant?
On paper yes, but it's already been pointed out to you that he is still involved with his business.
The story group are good folks...but this is a money making endeavor...it will be a book.
Just because he didn't explicitly say terrorist attack doesn't mean the rest of us don't know what he's talking about.\n\nAn incident related to "immigration problems" mentioned in the same breath as Nice and Paris? Don't pretend like you don't know what he means.
I guess it varies. I prefer to learn than rely on the fleeting kindness of strangers.
This sounds super fishy and unrealistic. Avoid.
Kind of a weird design choice to present it as a refraction.
Douche
Not much, just you making a mountain out of molehill. My grandparents say shit like this all the time.
/r/politics has 3 millions subscribers. That's not a "little" by any stretch of the imagination.
With Rosie O'Donnell as Steve Bannon. That would upset him so much!
I think it ends up falling on the gimmicky side.
There is no evidence to suggest he ever "turned it around." He is by all accounts over his head in debt. Banks and debtors own most of his properties, they just let him keep his name on it because they thought they would take less of a hit that way. \n\nYou're also conflating wealth with business savvy. Just because he's rich doesn't mean he's a good businessman. By that logic Alice Walton is a better businessman.

What's so funny to me is that you 'pedes are so afraid of terrorists, but fail to realize the common thread between them and you is right-wing extremism.
That's too much.\n\nYea you fucked up, but literally everyone has. \n\nDon't dwell on it, just figure out what you did wrong and apply what you learned to the next interview. Piece o' cake.
Your logic is awful. You're trying to equate an organized protest with a campaign stop.
What about Argentina greenlighting permits for his business immediately after he brought it up to their president? That's gotta concern you a little bit, right?
I know you're attempting to be sarcastic, but this is just over the top stupid.\n\nNobody hates clean air and water, because that's fucking retarded. They do think regulations shouldn't interfere too greatly with business, which is why they roll back pollution laws every chance they get, but pollution laws are entirely necessary and good for the economy as a whole.
Would you call it *unpresidented?*
There's a huge amount of overlap between /r/The_Donald and /r/TheRedPill. They don't have any women.

Damn. I thought y'all were just fucking with me.
Better let Cornelius know you think his behance page is better than his blog.
You're giving excuses, deflecting, and straight making things up. Just some advice Wang, you're making a mockery of yourself and other Trump supporters.\n\nYou're explicitly refusing to acknowledge that the concerns about his conflicts of interest are entirely valid. You're fooling yourself if you think there's anything "constructive" about that.
I've seen a lot of race-related ones too. I guess that's how it works when you learn it from pornography instead of literature.
Dude, watch the video and see how wrong you are. It's not even a minute long.
Nice penis.
Thanks goodness we have you 'pedes to translate literally everything he says.\n\nYour own interpretations of "what he meant" are truly a blessing.
If you think that's bad go check out /r/Incels.
But seriously, have you?
Looks like Kelsi Monroe
7/10, would be better as a route heat map that shows 1000 miles along actual pathways.
This was never a debate. It was you ironically complaining about hypocrisy and me telling you to address your own before whining about others, which you still have not done.\n\nYou can come down off your high horse at any time. You are *so much worse* than an SJW because they're at least *aware* of what they're doing.
Immature? Chief, you're the one that's asserting complete falsehoods and making up excuses for everything that man does.\n\nHis conflicts of interest and should absolutely concern you. You can still support him and be critical of his ethically dubious behavior.

If only there was some sort of records or documents that could indicate how much wealth he actually has maintained.\n\nTrump's companies are almost [2 billion in debt.](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/donald-trump-businesses-owe-debt-18-billion-150-institutions-study-source-of-study-president-elect-a7512586.html\n) Take the 5 seconds to google it, dude. \n\nHe fucking calls himself the "king of debt."

"Look at my African American over here"
Dude, I am fully aware I'm being an asshole to you. It's so obvious I didn't think I needed to explicitly tell you I'm being an asshole. The difference is I'm not complaining about assholes whiles I'm doing it.\n\nYou, a hypocrite, are complaining about hypocrites. Do you see the difference?
What makes you think *this* rally will be any different than all the previous ones?
Would you call it *extreme vetting?*
You are also throwing a pretty big tantrum, chief.\n\n* He was sued by the justice department twice for not renting to black people.\n\n* He  took out a full-page newspaper calling for the deaths of 5 black teenagers. And continued to call for their deaths after they were proven innocent to "send a message."\n\n* He says Mexicans are rapists and murderers, but *some, he assumes,* are OK.\n\n* He claimed an American-born judge was incapable of fairness because he was "Mexican."\n\n* He explicitly said he doesn't want any black accountants handling his money.\n\n* He re-tweeted white supremacists over 70 times in the last year alone.\n\n* His executive order banned Muslims specifically. Christians from the 7 countries listed were still allowed to enter.\n\nThere are plenty more examples, these are just off the top of my head.\n\nIf you haven't noticed a pattern yet, you're probably too deep in denial or fanaticism and never will.
Not quite
He still maintains ownership and profits from it. In what reality is that considered separated?
Bummer. Get a stronger brain.
There is a consistent enemy...Sidious 
That would be great to explain the fact that parsecs are a measure of distance not time...I'm partial to the idea it means he got closer to the black holes than anyone else...
Not where I expected it to go...but I continue to be impressed by the ability to tie together disparate timelines.
The Clones served with him after he turned though.
Jesus, this is a Star Wars sub....you never heard of a lightsaber?
Yeah, it was glorious. It devolved almost into r/subredditdrama territory
What Metro area though? Huge difference between Tulsa and San Fran.\n\nThough nursing is one of those fields, at lease right now, that the pay remains more constant across regions from urban to rura because of the high demand in aging rural communities. So while "retail salesperson" might be having the wage curve dragged down by the people selling cell phones in Iowa, the nurses don't, so it keeps the mean and median higher.
Yup.
Sounds like there may be more writing on different faces of the crystal?
Dammit, I wanted to make that reference...
Ah, thanks, will do. Apologies, I do appreciate a well run sub.
One thing to consider when thinking about how far some of these missed shots may go is just how empty space is, and how even beyond being empty, most of what's there is desolate and unpopulated. So to cause any damage...first you have to miss your target (no problem), then you have to find something to hit randomly in space, then that something has to have something of value on it for anyone to care, and you have to avoid hitting it in the wrong way (glancing shot or something), and it has to be weak enough to take damage. A single TIE turboshot to an ocean probably isn't going to do much.
But will it really increase sales? At least at the same rate as labor costs and insurance costs?
Look into the Superior Himing Trail, especially more Northn units, but Gooseberry to Split Rock is a great southern one..
Yay Iowa!
Also interested to see the type. Just got done running 10 lbs of bacon through my Casey and I am ready for an upgrade...
Any section of the UI you'd suggest? And any section of the shoot that doesn't offer livery?\n\nHow about the Whitewater or Turkey?
This is what I would suggest
No, this is CNN.\n-Mufasa 
Woohoo! Thanks for the citation lol
Check out Kickapoo Valley Reserve near Viroqua, and over in Minnesota the Lost Creek Trail.
I could get behind this, though I doubt it.
Are there different sizes?
Link doesn't work on Mobile but I think I know what it is.
I think he should know...but the core people who know should not know he knows.
Me too
Whatever he says for the offer, counter half.

We have that cake tray
Apparently I'm not 100% correct, it's at least also because it's harder to sanitize. \n\nAlso, Iowa is not really a dairy state. Yes we have it, but our specialties are corn, beans, hogs turkeys and eggs.
Honest question: do you just not vote in races without a Libertarian? Do you write in? Do you still tend to vote Republican in that situation?
I find machete order brings a lot to Vaders Redemption and the Fall of Palpatine...
But watching the PT after RotJ makes the redemption retroactively more impactful. Inserting between as a flashback makes it impactful as it happens.
Intelligent people abandoned rural Iowa. A number of factors, both positive and negative, lead to this, but ultimately: higher education tends towards liberal voting and tends away from rural living.
This does bring up an interesting idea...introducing someone (like Bariss, but not) who we saw as a Jedi or maybe a young king, in TCW, as an inquisitor.
In your view our experience, how would you say they compare to Izaak Walton league?
Should we fight monopoly on the merit alone of it being a monopoly? It depends on what your ultimate goal of the economy is. Strictly regulating market diversity is a pretty hands off way of spreading around wealth, because it still allows the strong to get the most money, it just means there are relatively more strong to deal with. \n\nThis article just loosely touches on some of the ills of monopoly, such as depressing labor costs, aka wages. If I work in widget making (I need a new job, but that's neither here nor there) and there are 100 widget firms, they will compete for my skills and there's a better chance I'll get my top dollar. If there is 1 widget firm, I'll get what they pay or I will get the best pay in an industry I am less effective in.
Okay so clarify for me...was Oddy the leak? He's clearly in it just to get his wife back, so did he do the whole thing, risk all those lives just in the hope of eventually going on a mission where he might get on Terex's ship? Missions where all his friends could have died at any point, or they could have blown up Terex's ship?\n\nOr did he just go on this one mission and intentionally get on Terex's ship?
If his doctor told him "/u/probablynotclever is a threat," I would say that makes him weak in that regard, yes.
I don't think you understand the use of context. To make a threat is different than something posing a threat.
That was my question, thank you for understanding my poor writing lol.
Good info. I know the population is not completely genetically pure anywhere. Period. And this isn't really for any purpose but fun, so close is good enough. 
Yeah Midwest!
A side note on why this is important...even for regular customers, customers who have been with you for years, Google can be the main way they contact you/refer you to friends. I don't have my dentist/mechanic/doctor/insurance agents phone number saved or written down anywhere, nor do I know the hours of my favorite restaurants unless I go there (like I have certain places I always go for lunch but also serve dinner).
This does look like a good group, but...can anyone recommend a group more balanced between hunting/fishing and paddling/hiking while still maintaining general conservation for the sake of conservation activities?
I fail to see how running to call the cops is worse than you being fatally wounded?
Awesome thanks
Oooo that does look fun but that's way out of the way for any of the other places...thanks for the suggestion though, going to read more about it anyway.
This is not all my pieces, also. I have another small skillet, a large round flat griddle, a muffin pan, two Dutch ovens and a bacon press.\n\nWhat to get next....
You must be pretty far out to have the choice to fo to Union or LaSalle...
That chart is good in concept but it lacks two huge things...cost of living varies widely within a state (could be done as a map at county level) and does not include benefits (could use a standardized valuation of benefits).
That's not canon
This is very true...
On one hand, this really makes it sounds like the entire country is unbelievably mentally weak. Because you lost an election your health is threatened?\n\nExcept: the changes the Trump administration is making often have critical impacts on professional wellbeing. Even in the fields he is "helping", the uncertainty is making it very hard to do business.
My tip for Chambers or any other networking group (and I know Chambers can be more than networking) is to get good at making leading statements. Statements that make other people ask questions about your business. So like off handedly mentioning "a client did this" or "I have a client meeting" and be vague enough that someone says "remind me what it is your business does?" Or things like that. And always ask people about doing business privately, not in a group. If you had a good convo with a few people and one seemed interested, wait until later and grab them and say "hey, prospect, would it be alright if I gave you a call about that?"\n\nThe key is to just "be" in these environments and let the business come to you. But you need to make sure people know what the business is.
The only thing is it may have made him more suspicious. And really just being on Tatooine should have. Why did this droid just happen to end up with his step brother?
The Turkey is what runs through Elkader...I've heard great things but never been.
If it became expounded upon then I would like it. I just don't like it in the current form. Bringing Derlin into Ep 8 could help expound on it.
That's more pastrami that's Jewish American. Though also corned beef. But the addition of cabbage (bastardized colcannon) makes it Irish American
What churning does is introduces small air bubbles into the milk/cream. Big bubbles don't work. So baffles create a ton of small bubbles...no baffle just makes one big bubble.
Well we already have a few pre-ROTS (Yoda in Ben's Journals, Maul, and Obi-wan and Anakin) comic books, so book books won't be too hard.
What's "the area"? There are a ton of places in Northern MN but also if you're driving from elsewhere there are a lot of places in other parts of the Midwest worth stopping st
No, I mean there is something not strong to be threatened. I.e. Our screening process and enforcement was weak before 9/11 (not a comment on if it's correct right now, just a fact).
But as long as you are bringing in less than $1000 worth and. It selling it, it's perfectly legal to go get it and bring it back...
But this law doesn't state "defend themselves from a deadly threat", butninstead just "defend themselves". You could interpret this to mean it's okay to shoot a kid who is squirting you with a squirt gun. And, honestly, I could see a lawyer to stretch "themselves" to mean "their property", or how do we draw the line on when it's defending ourselves? Does the perp need to have a weapon? Be within a certain proximity? Be on the property? Need to be showing the weapon?
Right. You look at how much of another product could you sell with that shelf space and determine the opportunity cost, then set the clearance at that.
He was smart enough to not divest 
Reputation ruined, the mercenaries become untouchables and try to claim more land. The owner sends his mercenaries to attack them, until the untouchables offer to share the spoils...
My experience is that a certain not-small subset of hunters and hunting groups want to exclude hikers and other non-hunting recreationalists from protected land. Not all, but for instance I've been chastised for hiking in July on DNR land donated by DU because that's not "what it's for". I'd like to see a group that is just as likely to advocate for a hiking trail through a WMA as for hunting in an SNA, and really pushes to have it all open for all.\n\nAnd really, someone working on large landscape conservation in the Midwest.
Not OP...but that doesn't seem like too many tomatoes at all...\n\nFirst, at least in our house, we can what's available because you never know when you'll get a bum year. Might get 180 qts one year, might only get 30 the next.\n\nAs for using them....lasagna, spaghetti sauce, pizza sauce, bloody Mary's, tomato soup (with grilled cheese), homemade hamburger helper, tomato leathers, tomato juice drinks, baked pasta other than lasagna...there are a million things to make!
I have a feeling it will be a flashback or a comic book.
Yeah that's my concern...any idea for more quiet sections or quiet rivers (NE IA or SE MN)?
Plus additional insurance, utilities, assumes there is only one employee, etc etc. \n\nAnd yes, you could close up shop at 2, regardless. But then you might lose people before 2 who don't want to have to move at bar close.
The same has happened to me. Maybe 50/50, but I say soda way more than I did as a kid.
Where have we seen the temple of the whills?
Yeah, the reason for the Root is the inlaws are in Chatfield and could take the kiddo for the night...I'm leaning towards a Monday-Tuesday trip to avoid crowds...
This little excerpt has convinced me Snoke is from the unknown Regions, the threat sensed by many including Sheev, and an element to Thrawn's story.\n\nThat makes me wonder what Thrawn's knowledge of the Force is, and when these little hints will start showing up in Rebels.
I really want more elements of Outbound Flight reintroduced, and not just as a project of Palps. I want the Jedi to have sent someone out as well.
Great article.
Do you live in Dairy country?
I like that vertical rack...is it meant for that purpose or did you modify a magazine rack?
How did you find the population of paddlers in Augustin to be?
If the title said "stress caused by policies enacted by the Trump admin.", that would be one thing. But the way it is written implies the general existence of this man in power is causing health issues. The article title calls is a threat to public health. A threat means something is not strong.
Because Star Wars is a story, with characters and plots and motives and whatnot. That's just a statement when it's in the database.
Oooo the route guide sounds fun!
Oof we have a very early contender for winning Reddit today...
And part of where margins go is the higher competition for labor.
That's his real gift. He doesn't have to get the logic all the way there, just close enough.
THe problem there is Star Wars is a very binary world (until R1). Can't have three factions in episodic movies.
Dude I think you need to get your dog some better food...
It's actually enamel inside, so generally we boil in a normal kettle and then steep tea in that for serving.
If you need suck eat please (misspelled -->)cover thanks
For sure try out some Driftless fishing in Wisconsin, Minnesota or Iowa (probably Wisconsin or Minnesota). You already are going to go right along there, and a minor rerouted would take you through the heart. Plus crossing the Mississippi at LaCrosse is way cooler.\n\nOthers could give you more details...but check out Driftless Angler for an awesome loca shop.
The independent regardless of policy?
Well, he still could come back as an even more decorated general then. But I hate when the sole canonocity of something is based on the databank.
I don't believe it's "exploitation" when \n- it's way above minimum wage \n- both parties agree on those salaries \n\nBut you are right, it should be "fair" maybe the word for it would be "legal" I thing the way to go is offer this people working visas or some other kind of legal status, the farmers had been asking for this for years. 
He has no idea what he is talking about 42% it's ridiculous, in the Great Depression unemployment was 25% and people were jumping off buildings.\n\nUnemployment is less than 5% and if you take into account people who stop looking for jobs is around 10% but this is because a lot of those people in working age choose to be stay at home moms.
Yes, why do you want them out?\nGive me one good reason besides they not having papers.
She was in the country illegally for about 5 years.
But they bring drugs and crime!!!!!  /s \n\nYou are absolutely right, immigration it's one of those irrelevant things that people get very passionate about like gay marriage and abortion, politicians use it for votes and when in power they push their own "tax cuts for donors" agendas, to bad a lot of people gets directly affected for this nonsense. 
You know which sub, has a top post saying Milo is Jew, I commented on it to point out last Friday on Bill Maher's show Milo said he was Catholic, it back fired and I got a bunch of PMs insulting me one guy told me that I am a cuck and that I have a small penis, joke it's on him I am a girl and I have no penis at all, gosh I hate that sub.
That's not even the biggest problem the US is one of the top food exporters in the planet if we can't maintain competitive prices we are going to lose a lot of our GDP.
Xenophobic hate crime
Trump is a chicken.\nHe is scared of being asked "mean" questions.
Awesome! Have fun!
I asume your base for this information is simple supply and demand logic.\n\nYou might think that when there is an increase in the supply of workers, the ones who were here already will make less money or lose their jobs. Immigrants don't just increase the supply of labor, though; they simultaneously increase demand for it, using the wages they earn to rent apartments, eat food, get haircuts, buy cellphones. That means there are more jobs building apartments, selling food, giving haircuts and dispatching the trucks that move those phones. Immigrants increase the size of the overall population, which means they increase the size of the economy. Logically, if immigrants were 'stealing' jobs, so would every young person leaving school and entering the job market; countries should become poorer as they get larger. In reality, the opposite happens countries become richer when their population growths.\n
Yeah I am sure millionaires never put money outside the US /s 
Ironically they already pay around 15 an hour to illegal immigrants, the agriculture labor force has been declining for the last decade and it now has a 20% labor shortage, nobody wants to work those jobs.\n\nSources\n\n15 an hour: http://m.huffpost.com/us/entry/1720019\n\n20% labor shortage. http://www.agweb.com/mobile/article/farmers-brace-for-labor-shortage-under-new-immigration-policy-associated-press/\n\nAmericans don't want those jobs \nhttp://www.npr.org/2011/10/08/141183030/can-the-u-s-economy-really-function-without-undocumented-workers\n\n"Since this law went in to effect, I've had a total 11 people that were Americans come and ask for work," Boatwright says. "A total of one of those actually came back the next day. That one worker picked about four boxes of tomatoes before leaving the field and quitting."
Ayer en el mismo rato cuando Tillerson y Kelly estaban dando su discurso Trump dijo: "We're getting really bad dudes out of this country, and at a rate that nobody's ever seen before. And they're the bad ones. And it's a military operation."\n\n
Maybe the healthcare issue will speed up those trends.
2 days on Reddit 
So they are living here so what? \nThey are 10% of Houston's population I honestly prefer the police to take care of serious crimes like theft, human trafficking and murder than for them to go after every Latin maid and Asian manicurist in the city.
Ok, tiene que haber criminales en el montón de ilegales pero honestamente no caigas en esa retórica, en USA el año pasado hubo 14,500 homicidios de esos únicamente 8 fueron cometidos por inmigrantes digo son 3.5% de la población y cometen 0.2% de los crímenes.
Believe me, a caring mother being separated from her children it's no joyride in some cases those kids are giving up for adoption before mom can do anything about it.
A while ago when the golden shower rumors came out I saw a comment from a Russian guy here on Reddit, he gave a quite convincing statement about how in Rusia underage prostitutes are quite common and Putin has cameras on hotels at the end he said he wouldn't be surprised If the material Trump is being blackmailed with was more than golden showers.\n\nI mean the intelligence agencies had said that Rusia has compromising personal information on Trump, what they have or not have it's completely speculative. 
Civil offense, misdemeanor. \nLiterally people from all over the world overstays in the country every day, doesn't make it right but it's economically wasteful prosecuting it.    \n\nAlso another cheaper option will be to implement E-verify, the companies checking the legal status of the employees, it would save billions in taxes and the immigrants wouldn't come here if they couldn't find jobs so you wouldn't need the useless wall.
True, until last year they were treated as refuges escaping communism.
I want to believe
I think pedophilia it's what Rusia has on him.\n\n
More legit than the bowling green massacre.
It doesn't affect, look they are not "taking our jobs" a society doesn't have a fixed number of jobs to be divided between their citizens, jobs are created when there is demand of products, immigrants help on increasing that demand so actually they increase jobs and economic growth.
Yes and no, look, suppose you get rid of them and then you start paying 20-25 per hour to strawberry pickers, you go to the super market and see two packages of strawberries one imported that cost $3 dollars and one national that cost $9 dollars, now I would buy the American one that supports local businesses, but in reality most people wouldn't, because most people care about the price and they would go for the cheap one, that same logic applies to the global market, the US is one of the biggest food exporters in the world but no one it's going to buy overly price product from us, I mean if you were a market owner from Spain would you invest in corn that cost $2 a pound from the US or would you buy corn that cost $.50 from Argentina, what do you think would sell better? What do you think your competitor would have? \n\nWe can have high wages or we can have a competitive exportation market but we can't have both we do need the cheap labor.
They should get to work then, the agricultural workforce has been declining for a decade, right now there is a 20% labor shortage.\n\nSource http://www.agweb.com/mobile/article/farmers-brace-for-labor-shortage-under-new-immigration-policy-associated-press/
La hipotética idea de lo que tus paisanos sientan o no, no es justificación para la intolerancia, es ridiculo ni en EU los tratan tan mal.
It's a bubble, it's growing because of tax cuts and the cuts on regulations, that thing it's going to burst before 2020 mark my words.
I just enjoy the fact that I burn my mouth occasionally eating these things because one bite is over a 100 degrees and the next it's undercooked, also free diarrhea I have save hundreds on laxatives. 
You can't but it has happen before.
How so?
Abraham impregnating that maid 3000 years ago really fucked everything up.
Great article.
Pero siempre dice cosas así, pinta a los inmigrantes como criminales qué hay que sacar, dijo que quería sacar 2-3 millones en su primer año y solo existen 150k personas Ilegales que han cometido crímenes graves son 800,000 si tomas en cuenta los que tienen minutas de tránsito y cosas así, ha dicho muchas veces que todos se tienen que ir y que va a sacar a todos, aparte hace poco un memo que pedía la intervención de la guardia nacional para sacar a los inmigrantes.
Si ves la lista de las 1000 personas más ricas de Estados Unidos el 70% se hizo rico por cuenta propia.
Si, el 27% de la población que votó por Trump, y aún así no te topas con comentarios tan mamones sobre mexicanos ni en R/The_donald  
They can just stop buying US products and let the cartels run free and that will do.
So lets just spend billions on getting rid of them all, and then let them come back because we need the labor?
Yes he is 
She met all the DACA requirements, and she was renewing her DACA but it takes a couple of months to get approved.
I wouldn't be surprised
"We share a giant border with a bunch of of third world countries"\n\nHoney, go look at a map.
I read Kulti by Mariana Zapata last week and I've been chasing the same level of high with Unteachable by Leah Raeder, Ex games by Stella Rhys, and other Mariana Zapata books. \n\nSo far, no luck. The search continues.
No, I know Trump talks about the deficit every day but Mexico buys 230 billion a year from the US, the US buys 290 billion from Mexico - you can see the 60 billion deficit Trump often talks about right there -   The thing is Mexico's population is 100+ million people and the US is 300+ million people so 3 times more, with that into account Mexican people buy way more per capita than American people buys from them.\n\n\nAlso they do put a lot of effort and funds against the narcos, have you heard of the drug war?  \nMexicans as a culture are not particularly heavy drug users they don't really care about drugs but the US market has a high demand for drugs and the US government puts a lot of pressure on Mexico to fight the narcos the whole drug war has been done because it's on the US best interest, if Mexico stoped caring the DEA would have to fight that war here.\n
Look, suppose you get rid of them and then you start paying 20-25 per hour to strawberry pickers, you go to the super market and see two packages of strawberries one imported cost $3 dollars and a another one national cost $9 dollars, now you seem like a nationalistic person like myself I would buy the American one that supports local businesses, but in reality most people wouldn't particularly care about that more than they care about the price and they would go for the cheap one, that same logic applies to the global market, the US is one of the biggest food exporters in the world but no one it's going to buy overly price product from us, I mean if you were a market owner from Spain would you invest in corn that cost $2 a pound from the US or would you buy corn that cost $.50 from Argentina what do you think would sell better?

If there was a way for them to automatically get their documents they will do it believe me, do you really think they like living in fear of deportation?\n\nYour "take the steps" doesn't exist I have a friend whose father is an American Citizen he is trying to become a resident, the waiting line is 14 years according to several immigration lawyers he has to be here in the US Illegally for 14 uninterrupted years until he gains his status, half of the 11 million have immediate American Citizens relatives and they are actually following the "path" that "path" says they have to live here without papers for several years, 20 years if you are Mexican, 24 if you are Philippine 14 for everyone else.
I agree with getting rid of the criminals nobody is arguing that, but I disagree into putting all of them in the same box, some of them are nice people I know a lady that has a taco truck she works there every day from morning to late at night she has a 7yo American daughter with artritis, if she gets deported what's going to happen to the kid? She will have to live in a small Mexican town with literally no hospitals and no schools, or she will have to stay here and live here without her mother, is a shitty situation either way, doing this to people is horrible specially for the kid they are making them suffer, SUFFER, she is an American it makes no sense.
I live in Houston, Texas where 10% of the population is illegal and 42% of them are home owners, so what I am worried about is not the lenders losing money or the immigrants not paying their debts, what worries me it's when you have a lot of houses on sale it devaluates the house market which would cause negative equity mortgages for the rest of us.
Nah, we are cool with Americans, we have 1.2 million illegal Americans living in Mexico we really don't mind.
Don't forget the 10 billion that cost to buy the private land.
Trump just announced he has total confidence in Seff Jessions
Nadie en Estados Unidos te deja rentar una propiedad que cueste más de la tercera parte o en algunos estados más de la cuarta parte de tus ingresos, los comprobantes de ingresos son un requisito y el ingreso mínimo también, yo viví en Estados Unidos con mi esposo, cuando llegamos el ganaba el mínimo y yo no trabajaba nos alcanzaba bastante bien para los 2, pagábamos todos los servicios cable, internet, celulares etc. comida incluso es ese periodo (que duro 6 meses hasta que encontró un trabajo mejor pagado) compramos una computadora, una cámara Nikon D5000 un flash varios lentes, no salíamos mucho si acaso cada 2 semanas o así pero nuestra calidad de vida era bastante decente. 
Mexico has 1.2 million illegal Americans living in Mexico right now and they don't mind.
Or just save money and do nothing about them, Mexico could also stop the war on drugs and just let the cartels do whatever they want, then the DEA would have to deal with them here in America.
Cowards 
Please adopt me, I am tired of living in the US

No entiendo tu punto, obvio es preferible ser pobre en México a serlo en Uganda pero eso solo corrobora mi punto de que es preferible ser pobre en USA que ser pobre en México, supongo que quieres decir algo como "mínimo no somos Uganda" pero eso se sale de la conversación, mi punto no es criticar México solo quiero hacer ver que la calidad de vida de los mexicanos más humildes no es buena, mucha gente pasa hambre en nuestro país. 
The fact that studies made in the subject suggest illegal immigrants produce a small net economic positive doesn't mean it would be and equal oposite reaction if the immigrants were gone. 
Great!!   I recommend the areas surrounding Cancun or Baja California (los Cabos) it would be like living on a permanent vacation and we have whole English speaking communities over there you would feel like home.
Scared of what exactly? \n\nLast time I check you guys were the ones scared of immigrants, Muslims, refugees, people using the wrong bathroom, pizza places...
Yes, she was a bit careless, she send her documents on Feb 10, and she should have done it in January, good thing we have "good emperor" Trump so this student/criminal with no criminal record is detain so prisons for profit can make a buck, god bless America.
That's only posible if she was on DACA or if you live in California, I live in Houston 10% of the population here it's undocumented I know plenty of undocumented people and not one of them that has any kind of government assistance. \n\n
"They look Mexican to me" \n~ Trump supporters probably 
Yes, but you know what is way cheaper?\nDon't detaining them if they didn't commit any crimes.
Si pero también en USA eres considerado pobre si ganas menos de 50,000 dólares por año, ser pobre en USA es que no te alcanza para una un carro nuevo y tienes que comprar uno usado, ser pobre en México si esta gacho la verdad. 
That doesn't make sense, I get corruption it's big in Mexico but to say the government is a cartel doesn't make sense, if that were true they would have legalized drugs long time ago they could give the license to sell these products to friends and family charge taxes and pack a pretty penny for everyone involved, it would also make the country way more safe. 
Do you even read?\n\nIllegal workers increase demand of products, which creates jobs for everyone else, troll.
No, lol let me say it again civil offense, and I am done engaging in an argument with you because you are completely missing the point you first bought up, MONEY, and now you are changing the subject because you can't argue with the money logic, if we talk money Trump's plan is stupid.
Todos estos comentarios intolerantes me recuerdan el dicho: El enemigo íntimo de los mexicanos son los otros mexicanos.

So I see this have become a weekly thing now.
"their children take up space in schools that should go towards citizens."\nYes, but they generate jobs for teachers because of this.\n\n"they live in a home that a citizen could be living in."\nAnd they pay property taxes that go to the schools their children use, plus that adds to overall market property value, all home owners benefit from it.\n\n"they work a job that a citizen could be working."\nWell it's more complicated than that, society doesn't have a fixed number of jobs to be divided between their citizens, jobs are generated because of demand and more people living in the country generates more demand, every year a certain economic growth is expected and that is because of population growth.\n\nAlso Americans could hypothetically work those jobs, but they don't, there is a 20% labor shortage on agriculture, any person could go and apply tomorrow and they would get hired, the pay is on average 15 dollars an hour, it's a decent wage but the work is so hard that most people who try it don't go back. \n\n"they use social programs that burden tax payers."\nThey can't apply for any of those social programs, some of them apply for food stamps or things like that for their American kids but the kids are Americans you are not going to reduce the cost if you deport the parents on the contrary it would be more expensive to pay for foster care. \n\n"Would you let your neighbor come into your house without permission?"\nThey have adds all over small Mexican towns that say "come work for Tyson make up to 12dll an hour" is like USA as a country send two big messages to this people one says "not entry" the other one says "help wanted".\n\n\n
Yeah, The President of Mexico's approval rating when up a bunch after that. 
Yes if you are planing to deport non Mexican people to Mexico.

Half of them have one or more American Citizen immediate relative so yes they belong with their families, and they are not jumping "the line" it's a process I have a friend here in Houston whose father is an American Citizen he has been trying to become a resident for 7 years now, but the waiting line is 14 years, according to several immigration lawyers he has to be here in the US Illegally for 14 uninterrupted years until he gains his status,  a lot of these people are actually following the "path" that "path" says they have to live here without papers for several years, 20 years if you are Mexican, 24 if you are Philippine 14 for everyone else.

Go ahead and read my first answer \n\nTL DR: population growth = economic growth 
I think you are lying on behalf of supporting a political agenda. 
Cuando dices "acá" estás hablando de México? 
Immigration aside Mexico puts a lot of effort and resources in fighting the narco-war it would be bad for the American People if they stoped or lowered their efforts, if Mexico sets the drug cartels free the US would have to fight the drug war here. 
Yeah liking the healthcare, the environment, human rights, increasing the minimum wage, decriminalizing mariguana, and making college affordable had nothing to do with our votes we just like the D 
So we are getting ourselves in more debt, and at the same time we are slowing our economic growth, all for causing brown people to suffer and make trump supporters feel extra special. 
I think this is a bad idea, if they are not Mexicans and they know no one in Mexico they probably would spend a couple of nights in a homeless shelter and then they would try to cross the border again.
That's not an accurate analogy, you can own a house but you can't own a country.\n\nSome people in your "house" are welcoming immigrants they are giving them jobs, they are giving them economical stability and they are giving the said "kid" a part of the legal ownership of said "house". \n\nThis country it's not your house or my house, it's all of ours and most people are benefiting of these new occupants being in here.

I agree with you completely we should legislate, take into account that farmers have been asking for immigration reform to protect their employees for years now and they also have been asking to expand the unskilled visas for temporal workers program, congress has been unresponsive to both requests, I guess as you said "pain will create impetus for change" things have to get really bad before the support for said legislation grows even more.

But there are fellow hollywood trolls out there with funny commentary on the life of women.

STEM careers are demanding. I didn't choose to go that way for financial reasons, but if I cared to have a family it would get delayed by 5 years at least if I'd chosen STEM.

There aren't enough flexible work schedules available to men and women to accommodate 2 young working parents trying to Kickstart their careers simultaneously.

The Regime's military would be depleted and ineffective after Civil Wars A-C.  Political and loyalty tests would be implemented probably after Civil War B, maybe before.  Statistically, a fraction of the military would side with the American's against the Regime maybe in some sort of attempted coup.  Regardless, the promotion of even low level NCO's based on political affiliation and not merit will severely cripple the Regimes ability to have an effective prolonged  force projection on the world theater.  \n\nEDIT: Oh- my- god.

Years ago, playing World of Tanks, someone said this and it really stuck with me.  It was a Tier 4-5 battle.  If you've never played World of Tanks many Tier 3 and 5 tanks are a blast to play while the Tier 4's are mostly a depressing grind.   The M3 Lee was no exception.  The M3 Lee is slow and bulky, expensive to upgrade, hard to hide because of it's height, and the off center cannon fucks you the 50% of the time.  (the other 50% is spent exploiting the shit out of it).    Most of the pre-game chat consisted of people complaining about the M3 Lee.  When the battle was over guess who had the most kills, the guy in the M3 Lee.  All he said was "Smooth seas does not a skilled sailor make" then left the arena.  Damn.

Sadly that's the case for many problems.  The people in 'charge' are not affected as the same rate or to the same degree as the people they govern.  So an issue exist, one group sees it from only their perspective, another sees it from a different prospective.  Then both groups accuse the other of being enemies of the state for not seeing the same solution to the problem they do to the exact same problem.

Thank you for your bravery and alertness.
I find comfort in this photo. Since becoming a vegan I make myself aware of the strive of those without a voice that humans can't understand. I wish I could apologize to them for my past. I can only move forward and do what I can.
Good job. I have been vegan 2+ years and I'm gaining. I must be doing it wrong. I'm always hungry.
Does this require putting the cell phone and cigarette down? If so your expecting too much.\n
With elements of Nazism, morbid obesity, thinning hair, small hands, and functional illiteracy.\n\nWe should just call it Trump Syndrome
Soon as we see your tax returns.
It's indeterminate until you look in the box. 
Still doesn't make sense to use three different units for your cats. That can cause all kinds of mistakes....like in my house if you see a cat and say "c'mere kitty" it's usually 0 or 2 cats that respond, never 1.
It's better fat than regular cow fat though. Higher in unsaturated fats and good cholesterol. Plus is comes from happy cows that get massages and beer. If it's actual Kobe beef (raised in Kobe Japan) and not just Wagyu (the breed) that is. Kind of like champagne vs sparkling wine.
A steady diet of fast food and no exercise, he's on his way to being the bigliest president ever.
About 1/3 of the way through his first 100 days and he's already fixed the environment, despite the democrats (who hate jobs, merica, safety and children) trying to give Donald grief because he's Putin's puppet. \n\nBigly done Mr. Precident, Tremendous. Not Sad!\n\n/s
Well, lying is an issue but meeting with the Russians is totally the issue. Meeting with the Russians is the biggest issue so far, IMO.
Someone won't let them have afros?\n\nThe band or the hairstyle?
I beg to differ. \n\nThat wikipedia article is incomplete at best. A roadrunner in vacuum can almost reach the speed of light. If you ever encounter one at relativistic velocities do not attempt to catch them as this could be catastrophic. \n\nIn addition, within an atmosphere, based on cartoons, I estimate that a road runner is able to travel roughly 165 mph however, if shot out of a cannon they may go much faster. I'm gonna say 732 mph.  \n\n
A work of art.
You are better off just receiving oral sex. I know it's just but if you really wanna have an extra good shot (no pun intended) of having a kid you'll just have to give in to her needs and be a good partner/husband, whatever.
About 7 or 8, depends on how fat you are and how much math you've had. 
How do you know he's not a goat? Goats are often confused.
They came up with it via the transitive property?\n\nThey're mathematicians now?
Like a story about Trumpian ties to Russia? and Russians? \n\nI'm surprised more people having brought up the rumors that the Russian Mafia bailed trump out and now they own him.
What he's craving is for people to talk about something other than him being a Russian stooge and a traitor.
Too bad he can't also type backwards e's and r's....that would be so cute.
You think Trump eats fish that isn't in stick of fillet-o form? 
You need at least 3 1/2 pounds but if you really wanna bulk up you should get at least 5. Don't eat them straight or you'll dissolve. 
Erase the cloud below his nose so it looks like the contrail is coming out the top of it.
Penguins are like birds to things at the bottom of the sea too. Sea turtles, sea snakes, jellyfish, swimming scallops, squids....pretty much everything not at the bottom of the sea. But Penguins for sure, and ducks, and terns.....
We ended up going to Mars to get more candy bars I believe. 
They do not have hands to eat with so they evolved a fork tongue. However, they are unable to eat soup.
That is how the dead are honored in turkey culture.
Sounds like more vitamins and electrolytes to me. MAGA!!!\n\n/s
No no no. You're supposed to shake the label that says to shake well. 
The fat kind of dissolves when you eat it. It just about melts in your mouth. It's not greasy at all. 
Looks like he didn't do too well his first semester. 
That only works if a little baby is stuck under a car. Also, assuming your aunt weighs 100 lbs....she should be able to lift 10 tons. Was the car made of gold or lead by any chance?
But you don't know how many lives he has left. He could be on his last one. 
Yeah, cause that would be gross.
Not necessarily. Suppose your father has monkey genes, A, C, F, G and your mother has monkey genes B, D, E. You could end up with monkey genes A, B, C, D, E, F, G.......you'd be way more monkey related genetically speaking.
He's just mad because of this cover-up. Obviously cats can be dissolved in jet fuel if you use enough and have enough time but people won't admit it.
Based on growth rings it looks like different parts of the shark are different ages.
Nothing. \n\nJust too messy that way and sometimes it doesn't work and then you're just screwed. 
Cost.
Well he did sneak into Egypt illegally as a refugee, then came back to Israel and broke the laws including some of the biggest (violating the Sabbath, etc). \n\nThen they had him scourged and executed for it. I'm sure at some point it occur to Trump that he should bring back those punishments, to excite the base.
They really go all out on these flagship games so I wouldn't doubt it.
Trumps grandfather avoids compulsory military service and gets deported. Trump avoids compulsory military service and becomes president (in name at least).
Kyslyak can't be that great a master spy. He's more like a blundering secret errand boy. He keeps getting caught meeting people in "secret".
Everyone on your Xbox Live is really your dad. So it's all good. 
Trump supporters....yeah nothing can penetrate their weaponized logic busting mental deflector shields. 
Real LPT: Tuck em in your shoe and sit down (even if you have to pee) and tie them there. Cause if you really gotta go, you gotta go.
Couldn't even grab a pillow's pussy right. Sad.
That's what the article said. He just did one tweet saying "thank you".
Or an English class, or History, or......well he 'd have benefited from going to school and doing his own work instead of paying people to do it. \n\nedit: the irony is that when he came up we had one of the best public education systems in the world, if not the best.
Yeah but if you were illiterate you wouldn't be able spell either no matter how good your brain is, or how gigantic your hands. Spelling is for dummies anyways. Dummy.\n\n/s\n 
Were you in space?
He needs to build and army of Stephen Miller clones to do his bidding. Lets not forget, Obama decided not to build a death star when he had a chance.
You never see "torpidity" in a newspaper headline.
And plundered German scientists, Russia too. 
Who knows? Sometimes ppl don't like factual?
We still had the numbers we just didn't show up to vote. Same way with Bush-Gore. Republicans get fired up and vote, we get fired up and assume everyone else will vote so we don't have to. It's how a minority party still ends up winning. They've never had greater numbers in recent history maybe ever.
Fake language.
Lets change our party name.....the Freedom Love American Flag Party.....the F.L.A.G. Party. Lets see a real Murican vote against that. It'll confuse the hell out of them.
Most of the time yes....but a pygmy goat has very small hooves and can use a keyboard, they just cannot spell good. OP may have been the best spelling goat on the planet though, you never know. I do agree though, most goats you meet on the internet aren't goats.
If I told you that would be taking credit for it.
You might be able to do it with 6. Definitely 6 if you've got any Peruvian in your ancestry.

We can't show them anything because they only watch their news, only speak to friends who feel the same, only read their stories and ignore everything else. You're not going to show them unless you can get an article in Breitbart, or get Alex Jones to believe you.
I imagine little Aryans are nicer to be around than little Satans I would assume. What with the sulfurous stench and fire and stuff. So if would make sense that Aryan pedophilia would be better....
I could see how Trump could think that because he seems to think he can just order the Justice Department to prosecute or investigate anyone he wants.
Well done with ketchup?
Despite their best efforts most blind people eventually fall asleep at least once a day. You just have to learn to live with it when you know a blind person.

I would say that makes them not a Christian. Christian doesn't mean you got to church, or you're against abortion, etc.\n\nChristian means you follow the teachings of Christ. IMO
That's totally different, she was using her own private server. Pence was using someone else's public server.
He thinks a president can just order a warrant/investigation. Remember how he promised he would do that to Hillary. 
That doesn't sound right at all. 
It's called the egg stamper. Not to be confused with the egg stomper.
Cotton sheep shrink but the wool ones don't. 
He's not a product of our education system. He went to private schools all his life. He's a product of paying other people to do his schoolwork.
Static wrap loves everything including itself. It clings to everything because it loves everything. Normally static tends to form one sided relationships and rarely ends up happy but then when it touches itself it's like love squared because each layer is equally in love with the other. It's the only time static wrap can be in a mutually loving balanced relationship.
The Russia connections or the Obama wiretap?
Well it is pathetic for sure just not for the reason he's implying but to be fair I think he probably assumed Bannon did it already.
Just one right after the "johntra".
Dementia on top of psychopathy.
Democrats aren't constantly spouting their love and admiration for Putin. Democrats didn't get helped by Russia to win an election. Democrats don't have a dossier about their deals with the Russians and Democrats did their meetings **legally and not in secret**. Democrats didn't pack their government with people involved in Russia.\n\nThis is what we need to do though. Keep him tweeting about Russia. Don't let him distract us with all his other stupid shit. It'll be hard because no one does stupid like Trump does stupid but we need to stay focused.
We don't need to clean up the Great Lakes because the EPA has accomplished it's mission, meaning the environment is protected. And it happened on Trump's watch. \n\nWho's the greatest environmentalist ever?\n\n/s\n
Pedophilia is ok with them. It's the combination of pizza and pedophilia that Republicans find so repulsive.
Perfect example in my mind of how nominal Christians (and I'm a Christian) do mental gymnastics to find any way to make the most evil, greedy, petty, exploitative, horrible excuse for human being, look like the savior to them. \n\nHe is a true anti-Christ (as in against everything Christ is about), the Prince of Lies, he's much much closer to THE anti-Christ than the messiah.
In black and white. It's very sad.
OMG that is brilliant!!!\n\nSince I read that I've printed out 500 sheets....hold on have to reload the printer, with my new paper!!!! \n\nPrinting out the next 500 now. Hope I don't run out of white ink. 
Obama is someone. Sounds like confirmation to me. 
You should stay standing, put your arms out perpendicular, and spin in the opposite direction from the tornado. 
But you said, if.....and if....you never asserted you were real or ghosts were real. So you're logic is ok. You could use some bigger words to sound smarter but the logic was ok.
Somewhere some Trump fan is really aroused by that picture. 
He also doesn't know the law, gets his intelligence briefings from Breitbart and Alex Jones, goes to Mar-a-lago every weekend, has top secret crisis meetings in the dining room.....\n\nOh, yeah.....btw what is our response to North Korea's launch? or Kim Jong Nam's death?
Not much to em really. Just put food in one end. Rinse off the other end every few days. 
It's not called atomic because it's a single atom. It's atomic because it's radioactive. That's how they protect you from cavities. It's called a jaw breaker because eventually the cancer makes your jaw brittle. 
He's 70 years old, it's not like he's gonna get any smarter. I don't even think he's capable of even learning anything new at this point.
Space.
I go fishing all the time and all the women I see fishing have clothes on, so yeah I'm pretty sure at least some of them know. 
This is an interesting choice. Beshear is not some up-and-coming star (he's 72 years old), but he's a guy who twice won overwhelming victories in Kentucky and oversaw the creation of Kynect, [one of the more successful state-level Obamacare exchanges](http://www.kentucky.com/news/local/news-columns-blogs/tom-eblen/article111795887.html) (their current GOP governor has since disbanded it for pretty much no reason). 
Also, 52% said that they think he will be at least a "not so good" President, 53% said that he is not honest, and 52% said that he does not care about the average American. And 45% of those surveyed think that he will be worse than Obama as president. \n\nAlso, people approve of President Obama's job performance by a 55-39 margin, so nice work, America!  
[He's a moderate](http://www.ontheissues.org/TX/Henry_Cuellar.htm) who may appeal to Hispanic voters. 
Didn't see it mentioned here, but [there will be a 4th season](http://variety.com/2016/digital/news/catastrophe-amazon-season-3-4-1201814226/), as well. 
Trump won this district 47-46, but it remains unclear if the electorate there is becoming more Democratic or if they simply didn't like Trump (Tom Price won reelection easily). Also, Democratic turnout in a special election could be an issue. Still, it's good to unite behind a candidate. 
It's worth clicking on the link in the tweet, as they have additional polls on their site. \n\nOne of the [most striking polls](http://www.people-press.org/2017/02/16/1-early-public-attitudes-about-donald-trump/) is the comparison with recent presidents at this point in their first term. Since 1980, GWB had the worst February numbers from a Pew poll....at 53-21.\n\nAlso striking is the extremely-low level of uncertainty among the public. Dating back to 1980, at least 19% of those surveyed by Pew have said that they "don't know" how the new president is doing, regardless of who the president is. Trump? 6%. The public KNOWS what they think of this guy's performance and they fucking hate it. \n\nAlso, \n\n18-29 - \n\nStrongly approve: 15%\n\nApprove: 9%\n\nDisapprove: 12%\n\nStrongly disapprove: 55%\n\n30-49 - \n\nStrongly approve: 27%\n\nApprove: 8%\n\nDisapprove: 13%\n\nStrongly disapprove: 48%\n\nIf there's anything to take solace in at this point, it's knowing just how much the under-50 crowd fucking hates Trump. I just hope that the Democratic Party can somehow use this energy and mobilize these people against him. 
I'm a big fan of period dramas, Tom Hardy, and BBC productions, but was hesitant to watch this one because it's received generally mediocre reviews on Metacritic. I've now watched 4 episodes and am into it, but definitely think that it's pretty slow so far and I understand why some critics were not wild about it. 
Still drives me nuts that they couldn't take down Issa. That bastard had been winning recent elections by 20+ points, but the situation changed and the Democrats fell JUST short of pulling the upset (lost by 0.6!). Doug Applegate had [barely money in his campaign fund until like June](https://ballotpedia.org/California%27s_49th_Congressional_District_election,_2016) and was at a significant funding disadvantage the entire time, but he's already declared that he's running against Issa again in 2018 and should be able to raise the funds that he needs to win. If our party is competent at all, they should be pouring money into this race. \n\nDenham first won by 29.5 points in 2010, and then followed that up by winning reelection by 5.4 in 2012, by 12.2 in 2014, and by 3.4 this year. This was the toughest challenge that he has yet faced, but midterm turnout is usually tricky for us. He should be a major target. \n\nStephen Knight won by 6.2 points last year and should be vulnerable in a lower-turnout midterm, if we get our people out. \n\nDavid Valadao should theoretically be the biggest target, based on the strong Democratic-lean of his district, but he's managed to overcome it easily. \n\nEd Royce has been winning comfortably since he got to Congress in 1992 and little has changed. 15 points (his margin last year) is a pretty narrow margin for him, but he's obviously still pretty entrenched. Maybe there's an upset possibility if we get a solid candidate and fund him/her, but I'm not optimistic \n\nRohrbacher also won easily last year (17 points), even if it wasn't his usual margin. He's turning 70, so the Democrats should have better odds whenever he decides to call it quits. \n\nWalter's has only been there since 2014, but she also won by 17 last year.  \n\nCalifornia seems like a great place to target if we want to re-take the House, but only a few of these targets seem especially vulnerable. I'd love to be wrong, though, and hope that we go hard after all of them.

In 2012, the GOP candidate for this district took 1,404 out of 27,402 votes. Considering that turnout should be much lower in a special election, a write-in campaign may be very doable (may only require a few hundred votes, even), but the Democrats would obviously need to coordinate it. 
Buckhorn is still [pretty undecided at this point](http://www.tampabay.com/news/politics/stateroundup/will-bob-buckhorn-run-for-florida-governor-doubts-growing/2313404) 
DailyKos readers have raised nearly $560K for Ossoff's campaign, so he theoretically has the money needed to mount a serious bid. \n\nhttps://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/dkendorsesjonossoff?refcode=20170210fsdatessetthermometer&tandembox=show 
It needs to be noted that there's been an ongoing court battle [since 2011](http://www.dallasnews.com/news/texas-politics/2016/12/30/plaintiffs-texas-redistricting-case-ask-federal-district-court-rule), in which Latino groups have argued that they (and black voters) were screwed over under the GOP's legislative and congressional gerrymander in Texas. If we ever get a favorable ruling, it should boost our prospects there in 2018.  
The guy who represented SD-2 had won recent elections with more than 75-85% of the vote. You never know with special elections, is probably pretty favorable to the Democrats. \n\nhttps://ballotpedia.org/Connecticut_State_Senate_District_2
According to [this article from last week](http://www.bozemandailychronicle.com/news/mtleg/senate-passes-bill-allowing-all-mail-ballots/article_967574e6-8ccf-5e5e-9778-9996a06be09c.html), the bill easily passed the state Senate, with the GOP sponsor saying that he wants to give counties the option of going to all-mail ballots for the special election. I have no idea when it will be voted on in the House or might become law, however. 
2 days prior to the election, NBC [released a poll that found that 49% of those surveyed would consider voting for Obama again if they could](https://twitter.com/mmurraypolitics/status/795386754509533185?s=09). If you consider this + his immense popularity among young people (77% approval among millennials, according to latest Pew poll) and black voters, it's very possible that Obama would have won reelection easily this year. It's hilarious to hear conservatives make the case that everyone hates the guy, when the Constitution is probably the only thing keeping him from being president for as long as he wants. 
She broke her streak by voting to confirm Nikki Haley as UN ambassador, but she was confirmed 96-4 and this was hardly the most egregious vote. \n\nAlso, while some people may be irritated by 2020 talk, the reality is that there are a lot of potential Democratic contenders who have an opportunity to spend the next 2+ years auditioning for the role. Gillibrand seems to be doing a nice job so far in the Trump era. 
This guy is young (32) and has an impressive academic background (2 degrees from Michigan and was a Rhodes Scholar), but he has only been a public official since 2015 and will probably have a difficult time against the better-known Whitmer. Still, he sounds like the kind of person we need running for office in the Democratic Party and it will be interesting to see how this primary plays out. 
Kyrou stats\n\nLast season (65 games): 17 goals (0.26 per game) and 51 points (0.78 PPG)\n\nThis season (59 games): 29 goals (0.49/game) and 85 points (1.44 PPG)\n\nHe's the leading goal-scorer on his team (by 5) and is far and away the leading point-producer (by *34*). 
Eric Holder (and Obama, I think) is leading the new [National Democratic Redistricting Committee](https://democraticredistricting.com), which is billed as a group that will fight GOP gerrymandering by electing Democratic leaders at the state level, fighting legal battles, and promoting state ballot initiatives. 
So the Dems hold on to another trifecta 
https://twitter.com/RicoBeard/status/819334388991361026
Jeff Flake barely won in 2012 (49.23-46.20-4.55 (Libertarian)), but that was in a presidential year and he could have the incumbent's advantage this time. There's a small upset chance here (Ann Kirkpatrick took just under 41% against John McCain in November, with another 5.5% voting Green), but it would be close and the Democrats would need to turn out in force. 
As indicated in the article, former US Rep. Betty Sutton (in Congress from 2007-2013) is seriously considering jumping in and will make an announcement next week. She was a victim of Republican gerrymandering, as she lost 52-48 in 2012 in a district that is now R+5.
What about his son Andy (the current state AG)? He'd have to run for reelection in 2019 and then immediately run for Senate, but it's theoretically doable. \n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Beshear\n\nHe could choose to run for governor instead, though. 
I will admit that I don't know anything about the possibility of it passing in Minnesota and was basing my comment on the partisan control of the state legislatures. Both chambers in the Minnesota legislature are controlled by the GOP and they are already attempting to force the state to divide its EVs by congressional district (some GOP EC-rigging bullshit), so I don't know how willing they would be to join this Compact. 
Yes
The Democrats supposedly have candidates for all House districts that are represented by a GOPer, but which also voted for Clinton (as well as some Trump districts).\n\nhttps://twitter.com/SeanMcElwee/status/830108010173329408 
A couple of points on this:\n\n1) The [Russian anthem](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AOAtz8xWM0w) is as badass as they come\n\n2) Many people might not realize this, but the music for the Russian anthem and the [Soviet anthem](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U06jlgpMtQs) is exactly the same. Russia initially went with a different tune after the breakup of the USSR, but later decided to go back to the classics, as the song wasn't sufficiently inspiring. Not just that, but they got the guy who wrote the lyrics for the USSR anthem in 1944 to write new lyrics for the same tune in 2000.  
Yes, the polls close at 8. \n\nAnd [this guy](https://twitter.com/Taniel) is one of the better people to follow for election news from a progressive perspective and he's tweeting about how he's never had a harder time finding results (there doesn't seem to be any anywhere). It's insane that the state SOS site does not even have a page for it. 
Yes, I saw that last night. It's disappointing and I'm interested to hear about his plans for the issue as governor. 
He cited Rasmussen because it's the only pollster that has had him at 50% approval or better in post-inauguration polls. Even if it's true that he's at 55% in their latest poll, his numbers are mediocre-to-terrible in every other poll (and 55% is not even that impressive for a new president).\n\nhttps://elections.huffingtonpost.com/pollster/trump-job-approval
2012 - Obama loses Texas, taking just over 3.3 million votes\n\n2014 - Greg Abbott is elected governor, winning 59-39 and taking nearly 2.8 million votes (Wendy Davis got more than 1.8 million)\n\n2016 - Hillary loses Texas, taking almost 3.9 million votes \n\nTo be clear, I highly doubt that O'Rourke would/will win (he might be better off running for governor) and it might not be close. But I don't think that it's as simple as "he's way too liberal for Texas to elect". Sure, this is not an apples-to-apples comparison, but the Election Project [estimates](http://www.electproject.org/2014g) that *28.3%* of eligible Texas voters turned out in 2014 (worst in the nation) and there are winnable races if we are able to even approach the turnout from a presidential year. I am very skeptical that it can happen, but the opportunity is there. 
Yes 
I really hope not. I mean, my main interest is in getting the most progressive Democratic candidate policy and, if he's it, then fine. However, Illinois is celebrating its 200th birthday in 2018 and,  as I recently looked at the list of governors that we've had, I realized that the state (and its more than 12.8 million residents) has never had a governor who is not a white man. If a white man turns out to be the best choice in this cycle, then I'd support him (and I am a white guy). But it's insane to me that they can't find a single woman (and most of the residents in the state are female!) or non-white man to do the job. I really hope that that ends in this cycle.  
No. Rob Delaney tweeted that you can't watch it legally in the US until April 28th \n\nhttps://twitter.com/robdelaney/status/836825858941804546
1) 21% undecided is pretty large\n\n2) Warren wins 70-9 among registered Democrats. If she ran, there is no way in hell that she's only going to pull in 70% of the Democratic vote. \n\n3) 34% of independents had no opinion\n\n4) 34% of those surveyed have no idea as to who Elizabeth Warren even is or they don't have an opinion (including 30% of Democrats, apparently), let alone like or dislike her policies\n\nWith figures like that, I don't think that it's possible to make any major conclusions about her 2020 prospects
I really like Garcia, but am wary of him starting because of his offensive abilities\n\nFirst 32 PAs last season: .565/.688/.913, .348 ISO, and 316 wRC+\n\nNext 225 PAs: .241/.351/.304, .063 ISO, and 82 wRC+\n\n1) Garcia doesn't not hit the ball with much power (23.6% hard-hit overall and 22.1% in last 225 PAs)\n\n2) He hits a ton of groundballs (50.3% GB-rate and 2.08 GB/FB last year)\n\n3) When he hits flyballs, they rarely leave the yard (7.7% HR/FB rate in 2016)\n\nI really like Garcia and want to see him do well, but hitting the ball with only moderate force and on the ground, as he has a tendency to do, is not really a recipe for success in the majors. I'd love to be wrong and for him to have a big season, but I'm skeptical. 
For those who don't know, Perriello is a progressive who (barely) won a conservative House district in the Democratic wave of 2008 and then lost his reelection bid by 4 points in 2010. He's young (42) and could be a real star in the party, but he needs to get past Northam in the June primary.   
I've never heard of this guy, but it turns out that he won a shocking victory in his city-council race in 2011 and then followed it up by taking 80% of the vote in his 2015 re-election effort (best in the city). Other articles indicate that he has ~50K in campaign funds, so it's going to be an uphill struggle against the other Democrats, let alone Rauner. 
SD-2 is extremely blue (like 75-85% Democratic). In a normal election it'd be a landslide victory for our side, but this is a special election and the GOP could put a big upset if nobody turns out\n\nSD-32 is very red (the former GOP rep was winning like 65-35 each time). Dems have targeted it, but it's going to be difficult. \n\nHD-115 is very blue (the former Dem rep took between 78% in 2012, faced no opponent in 2014, and got over 68% last year). \n\nWinning 1/2 Senate seats would be a good night for the Dems, as it would allow the party to (barely) keep control of the state government. The Dems have a 78-72 majority in the state House (our majority has shrunk considerably in recent years), so winning the open seat would preserve our current cushion. 
Yes, I remember them becoming a national sensation during their run to the Elite Eight under Dan Monson in 1999 [(which gave us one of my favorite SI basketball photos) ](https://cdn-s3.si.com/s3fs-public/si/multimedia/photo_gallery/0802/beck.bestshots/images/LED02S\\(2\\).jpg)

I live in Will County and remember an endless barrage of Rauner TV ads in 2014 [(here's our "everyman" multi-millionaire governor and his minivan, for example)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGNkN8IVbXA). He won by 4 points (a landslide by GOP standards in this state), taking every county but Cook in the process. [His approval rating is  33%](https://morningconsult.com/governor-approval-rankings-september-2016/), but he could get reelected if Democrats don't turn out. They don't need a ton of support outside of Chicago, but they're not going to win if they lose virtually every county again.

It's not just Trump, either. 44% say that his cabinet selections have been below-average/poor choices. In recent decades, George W. Bush had the 2nd-most unpopular cabinet...at 13%.\n\nhttp://www.gallup.com/poll/201833/approval-trump-transition-low-inauguration-nears.aspx
Yes, he was forced to face fellow representative Marcy Kaptur in a Democratic primary and lost 
It gets better! [Mika Brzezinkski has since joined the conversation, telling the CNN PR account "You're not the first".](https://twitter.com/nycsouthpaw/status/828680007602036736) 
I'm not throwing out a thing. I acknowledged in my post that I don't know why people chose to vote for one candidate or another, but there has been a clear trend over the past 12+ years in all 3 states (I did not include 2008 or 2012 data because it would have made an already-long post even longer). No shit, Trump is not your typical GOP candidate and it remains to be seen whether the Democrats continue on the current path that they're on in these states. However, I am not going to just dismiss Hillary's results as a fluke. 
[The poll results](https://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnn/2017/images/02/03/rel2a.-.trump.pdf)\n\nOnce again, there's a huge age disparity \n\n18-34: 32-64 approval. 52% strongly disapprove of his job performance, while 15% strongly approve. \n\n35-49: 39-58\n\n50-64: 56-43\n\n65+: 53-46\n\nUnder 45: 33-63. 50% say that they strongly disapprove of his job performance. \n\n45+: 53-45\n\nAlso, \n\nUnder $50K: 38-60\n\n$50K+: 48-50\n\nCollege Grad: 37-61\n\nNon-College-Grad: 48-50\n\nWhite College Grad: 38-59\n\nWhite Non-College-Grad: 59-38
She didn't have much of a choice in terms of staying in Congress, as her district went 52% for Romney in 2012, but was later altered to the point that he would have taken 64%. She got elected by 1.1 points in 2014, but that was when her district was far more purple than it is now. 
Its nickname is "The Show Me State" 
Because of the winner-take-all nature of the system (in almost every state), "landslide in the Electoral College" is a completely fucking meaningless expression. \n\nCandidate A: Wins 50.1% of the vote in every state (and Congressional districts in NE and ME)\n\nCandidate B: Takes 49.9%\n\nUnder this scenario, Candidate A would win the Electoral College 538-0, the absolute greatest EC landslide possible. And yet, virtually half of the country would have voted for Candidate B. Would that have really been "the biggest landslide in history"? Of course it fucking wouldn't. It would be incredibly stupid to call it that. \n\nTo further illustrate the stupidity of the point he's making, just look at the last election. If Hillary had increased her share of the vote by whopping 1.3 points in WI, MI, PA, and FL (needed less in the first 3), she would've won the Electoral College 307-231. Would that have been a landslide? Hardly. But, according to this moron, it would!
There might not have been a more frustrating state for the Democrats in the past couple of midterm cycles, as Rick Scott won 48.87% to 47.72% (indy candidates took 3.41%) in 2010 and won reelection 48.1% to 47.1% (other candidates took 3.9%) in 2014. However, 5.36 million voted in 2010 and 5.952 million voted in 2014, while 9.42 million voted this past November, so the votes are there for the Democrats to take.  
"Judge Donnelly is VERY UNFAIR and TOTALLY OVERRATED! Sad!" 
Gillibrand was a Blue Dog when she represented a GOP-leaning House district, but has moved sharply leftward since moving to the Senate. She is a New York Democrat in the sense that she is somewhat "Pro-Israel“ (although she broke with Schumer by supporting the Iran Deal) and is a timid Wall-Street reformer (but voted for Dodd-Frank), but is now someone with a solidly liberal record overall. \n\n1) She came out in favor of raising the minimum wage, initially calling for an increase to $10.10/hour,  but more recently (in 2015) joining the Fight for $15 crowd. \n\n2) She ran for Congress on Medicare-for-All and has been a longtime supporter of a public option (reaffirming that a few months ago) \n\n3) She led the campaign against DADT and in favor of passing ENDA (which would ban anti-LGBT discrimination). She's a longtime proponent of gay rights in general. \n\n4) She cosponsored the Dream Act and is in favor of a pathway to citizenship \n\n5) She introduced a bill to offer 12 weeks of paid family and medical leave\n\n6) She's called for marijuana to be dropped down to a Schedule II drug and cosponsored a bill with Booker and Rand Paul \n\n7) She led a campaign to tackle the issue of rape in the military and on college campuses \n\nAnd so on. \n\nIf you [look at the Wikipedia page on her positions, you'll find that she's quite liberal on basically every issue but Wall Street](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_positions_of_Kirsten_Gillibrand?wprov=sfla1) \n\nProgressive Punch, which tracks Congressional votes and rates Senators and Reps on their progressiveness, rates her as the sitting Senator with the 6th most-liberal lifetime voting record (excluding House votes) \n\nNational Journal, which has also ranked Senators on their voting records, had her as the 5th most-liberal Senator in 2013 (I don't think that they have any more recent rankings, unfortunately) \n\nhttp://www.ontheissues.org/NY/Kirsten_Gillibrand.htm   
Yup, but there's no indication of whether or not our favorable areas have reported yet
The Sanders-Klobuchar amendment in favor of importing drugs from Canada would have passed easily if the Democrats stuck together. The "No" votes from the Democrats were: Booker, Bennet, Casey, Cantwell, Carper, Coons, Donnelly, Heinrich, Heitkamp, Menendez, Murray, Cantwell, Tester, and Warner. I'm hardly a policy expert and I don't know what sort of impact it might have had, but Joe fucking Manchin and *Ted Cruz* (+11 other GOPers) voted in favor of it, but this group couldn't do it (Feinstein didn't vote).      
Because they misspelled it. The sub is /r/bluemidterm2018
A few comments\n\n1) Beyond the first 4 names on the list, everybody seems to be at least a year away. However, they had a number of guys make big leaps last season (Alcantara, Helsley, Williams, Sierra, etc.) and others make an impact in their first year in the system. There's a lot to like about the hitters that the Cardinals brought into the system last year, but they are still at the bottom rungs of the ladder and it will be interesting to see how they pan out (guys like Edman, Martinez, Knizner, etc.)\n\n2) Bryce Denton performed far better at the plate this past season, even if there is still little sign of the raw power that he is supposed to have\n\n2015 (169 PAs in GCL): .194/.254/.245, .499 OPS, 6.5 BB%, 18.9 K%, .052 ISO, and 56 wRC+\n\n2016 (225 PAs in App League): .282/.356/.376, .732 OPS, 8.9 BB%, 16.4 K%, .094 ISO, and 109 wRC+\n\nDenton will turn 20 in August, so there is still plenty of time for him to develop. He posted a solid BB-K ratio and hit for good average, but the ISO left much to be desired. Hopefully this will be the year that he starts to put everything together.\n\n3) It's very early, but it's already looking like the Cardinals might have pulled in one hell of a first-round haul last season in Perez, Carlson, and Hudson. Dylan Carlson was supposed to be a low-cost selection (at least as far as I understand it) and was a surprise pick when the Cardinals took him as early as they did. However, this is a guy was [long on the radar of one of the Cardinals' California scouts](http://www.stlsportspage.com/CARDSBASEBALL/tabid/91/entryid/4882/for-zach-mortimer-signing-of-dylan-carlson-ends-30-month-pursuit.aspx), who believed that Carlson was severely-underrated and that the Cardinals needed to take him if they had the opportunity (and they obviously did). He's already demonstrated considerable promise at the plate and may be one of the Cardinals' more exciting hitting prospects over the next few years. \n\nFirst 13 games (53 PAs): .122/.189/.122, .311 OPS, 7.5 BB%, 28.3 K%, .000 ISO, and 2 wRC+\n\nLast 41 games (164 PAs): .295/.354/.510, .864 OPS, 7.9 BB%, 24.4%, .215 ISO, and 154 wRC+\n\nCarlson will be 18 for the entire upcoming season, so the Cardinals have no reason to rush him along. His K% is a bit concerning, but it remains to be seen as to whether he was simply overwhelmed by facing older pitchers or if he has a real contact issue.   \n\n4) I follow the minor-league games online and am interested in the prospects coming up through the system, but I am no scout. That said, I'm surprised at a couple of omissions from this list. One of whom is [Matt Fiedler](http://www.fangraphs.com/statss.aspx?playerid=sa915642&position=OF), an OF drafted from the University of Minnesota this past season. \n\nLast 54 games (230 PAs in App League): .346/.404/.517, .921 OPS, 8.7 BB%, 14.8 K%, .171 ISO, and 153 wRC+\n\nFiedler struggled badly in his first few games of pro ball (0-15), but proceeded to go on an insane hot streak for the remainder of the season, basically being a doubles machine (20 in 54 games) and getting on base at an excellent rate. I have no idea how he is defensively, but he is not that old (will be 22 for the duration of the upcoming season) and I don't know why he would not receive at least a mention on a prospect list. It's possible that his average stats were a product of a high BABIP, but his ability to crank out doubles at such an absurd rate would seem to indicate that he can really hit and I would think that he's someone to keep an eye on. 
The current GOP rep won 49-47.6 in 2012 (1st post-redistricting election), but has taken ~59% in each successive election. It would be very hard for him to win there, but theoretically possible. \n\nhttps://ballotpedia.org/Indiana%27s_2nd_Congressional_District
Seems surprising, but Bustos won comfortably (60-40) in a swing district (was 58-41 for Obama in 2012, but Trump won it 47.4-46.7) in November and keeping that seat in Democratic hands could definitely help next year. 
now [THIS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purges_of_the_Communist_Party_of_the_Soviet_Union) is the kind of purge Bernie can get behind
This was what one of the DailyKos writers had in their election digest from today.\n\n"GA-06: Clout Research, the pollster formally known as Wenzel Strategies, takes a look at the April all-party special election primary for the blog Zpolitics. They give Democrat Jon Ossoff 32 percent of the vote, with ex-Secretary of State Karen Handel leading fellow Republican and wealthy businessman Bob Gray 25-11 for the second place spot. If no one takes a majority, which is all but certain in this huge field, the top two candidates will advance to the June runoff.\n\nThere are a few things to note about this poll. Wenzel was one of the worst polling firms in the business, and Clout has also displayed some very strange habits. This particular poll also one other thing worth noting. Ossoff was the one Democrat tested, while four other minor Democrats did file. Ossoff will almost certainly do better than any of them, but there’s still a chance that the others will take enough votes to cost him a spot in the general election.\n\nUnderstandably, Clout did not test all 11 Republicans. One of the candidates they left off, certified public accountant David Abroms, says he’ll spend $250,000 of his own money on his campaign. However, Abroms is running as a Trump skeptic, which probably isn’t the path to electoral success in today’s GOP."\n\n
Better offer list than Kirk Cousins had and he turned out just fine \n\nhttps://n.rivals.com/content/prospects/22479 
According to MLB.com, the Cardinals will now make their first choice at pick 94. While it sucks that they won't get to pick earlier, it should be noted that Harrison Bader was not taken until pick 100 a couple of years ago and the Cardinals managed to grab guys like Zac Gallen, Jeremy Martinez, Walker Robbins, Andrew Knizner, Tommy Edman, John Kilichowski, etc. after 94 this year. Thus, while they will not get a chance to draft early, there will be plenty of promising players available at their picks and it's far too early to declare that their draft will be a bust.       \n\nEDIT: Something else to consider is that the Cardinals already went wild in the international FA market last summer, signing highly-rated prospects like \n\nC [Carlos Soto](http://www.fangraphs.com/statss.aspx?playerid=sa900974&position=C/DH) (power-hitter who turns 18 in a few months)\n\n OF [Jonathan Machado](http://www.fangraphs.com/statss.aspx?playerid=sa924310&position=OF) (turned 18 last week)\n\nOF Victor Garcia (power-hitter who turns 18 in September)\n\nOF Carlos Soler (turns 18 in October)\n\nSP [Johan Oviedo](http://www.fangraphs.com/statss.aspx?playerid=sa922365&position=P) (6'6" power-pitcher who will be 19 in March)\n\nIF/OF Randy Arozarena ([Cuban defector](https://www.baseballamerica.com/international/cardinals-agree-sign-cuban-prospect-randy-arozarena/#hktOyE7KaJswZIfj.97) who turns 22 next month)\n\nand more\n\nSo, even if the Cardinals don't pick before 94 in this year's draft, they already have a handful of high-potential teenagers that they are hoping to groom into stars. 
If you want to understand how it could happen, look at how Trump and Paul Ryan pitched the delay of the fiduciary rule.\n\nIn case there was an confusion as to what an absolute snake Paul Ryan is, here's [his statement](https://www.speaker.gov/press-release/statement-president-trumps-executive-action-fiduciary-rule) on the issue. \n\n“President Trump’s action to delay the Obama administration’s fiduciary rule for further study is a wise one. This regulation is deeply flawed. It would significantly raise the cost of seeking financial advice, making it even harder for families to plan their future and save for retirement. It is essentially Obamacare for financial planning. Now we have the chance to study any unintended consequences before it is too late. In today’s economy, people’s access to sound financial advice must be protected.”\n\n1) "Obamacare, but for financial planning" - Oh wow, that tells me literally nothing about what this rule does, but it sounds terrible!\n\n2) "Now we have the chance to study any unintended consequences before it is too late." - Ah yes, of course. Let's just slow down a bit before we implement regulations like this one. Wouldn't want to make any hasty decisions!\n\n3) "In today’s economy, people’s access to sound financial advice must be protected" - The Punchline. Un-fucking-believable. \n\nAnd [Trump's memorandum on the topic](https://twitter.com/joelight/status/827645424982966272)\n\nIn both cases, there is no mention of what the fiduciary rule does or is supposed to do. All we are told is that it makes sound financial advice more expensive (Boo!) and limits our choices (boo!). But now we have FREEDOM. Great!
Before we grab our pitchforks, I would encourage people to click on the names of the various Senators and look at the actual votes they've cast.\n\nIn the case of Senator Hirono, her record of "voting with Trump" thus far consists entirely of voting to confirm a handful of nominees (Mattis waiver + confirmation, Kelly, Haley, Chao, McMahon, and Shulkin (VA Chief)). I understand the argument that she should been more bold as someone in very-safe seat, but are these votes really worthy of a primary? (Schatz is in the same boat, but also cast an inexplicable vote for Mike Pompeo to head the CIA). Possibly, but I think that we should wait a good 8-10 months (at least) before we start talking about primary challenges. [Progressive Punch](http://progressivepunch.org/scores.htm?topic=&house=senate&sort=overall-lifetime&order=down&party=), which rates members of Congress on the "progressiveness" of their voting record, has Hirono as the #5 most-progressive non-freshman Senator (based on lifetime voting record) and we're going to kick her out because of a handful of disappointing confirmation votes? Seems ridiculous to me, but maybe I'm wrong. 
Jason Kander's time as Missouri's Secretary of State has come to an end, but he was able to open the latest session of the state legislature one last time and he took the opportunity to [deliver a speech on the importance of access to voting. ](https://twitter.com/JasonKander/status/817045851033845760/video/1) He continues to come across as somebody who could have a major future in the Democratic Party (he's only 35!), but it will be hard to advance in a state like Missouri, which has shifted hard to the right over the past ~15 years. His next opportunity to take a leadership role in that state may not be until the 2020 gubernatorial election, so it will be interesting to see what he plans to spend the next few years doing.

Another point that I want to make is that, while I recently discovered that Rauner won every county except Cook, I did not realize how badly Pat Quinn got massacred in some places in 2014. And I'm not just talking about the rural, downstate areas, either. \n\n[2014 Results](http://edition.cnn.com/election/2014/results/state/IL/governor/)\n\nChampaign County (Downstate)\n\nObama (2012) - 51-45\n\nClinton - 54-36\n\nRauner - 55-41\n\nCook (Chicago)\n\nObama - 74-25\n\nClinton - 70-21\n\nRauner - Lost 64-34\n\nDeKalb (West Suburb)\n\nObama - 52-46\n\nClinton - 47-44\n\nRauner - 58-39\n\nDuPage (West Suburb)\n\nObama - 50-49\n\nClinton - 53-39\n\nRauner - 61-37\n\nLake (North Suburb)\n\nObama - 54-45\n\nClinton - 57-37\n\nRauner - 58-40\n\nMcHenry (Northwest Suburb)\n\nObama - lost 53-45\n\nClinton - lost 50-42\n\nRauner - 66-31\n\nRock Island (Borders Iowa)\n\nObama - 60-38\n\nClinton - 51-43\n\nRauner - 50-46\n\nSt. Clair (St. Louis Area)\n\nObama - 56-42\n\nClinton - 50-44\n\nRauner - 52-44\n\nWill (South-southwest Suburb)\n\nObama - 52-46\n\nClinton - 50-44\n\nRauner - 55-41\n\nQuinn did pretty poorly in the rural areas, as expected, but the real story is how badly Dem support tanked everywhere (even in Cook County). 
The state Senate is pretty evenly split (GOP currently has 21-19 advantage), but the House of Delegates has been dominated by the GOP since 2002 (currently 66-34). Any map that allows the Democrats to gain ground in the lower chamber would go a long way towards helping our side to take control of the state. \n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senate_of_Virginia\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virginia_House_of_Delegates
[From August:](https://www.mlbtraderumors.com/2016/12/jose-adolis-garcia-leaves-cuba-in-search-of-mlb-opportunity.html)\n\nAUGUST 30: Cuban outfielder Jose Adolis Garcia has left his home nation in hopes of securing an opportunity with a major league organization, Ben Badler of Baseball America reports. The 24-year-old is the younger brother of Braves third baseman Adonis Garcia.\n\nGiven his age and experience in Cuba’s Serie Nacional, Garcia will be exempt from international bonus pools. Of course, he’ll still need to clear several hurdles before he is eligible to sign.\n\nBadler explains that the younger Garcia brings an impressive set of tools — including a quick bat, 60-grade speed, and top-level arm strength. While he has lined up mostly in right field, Garcia is said to hold the promise of playing center.\n\nBadler notes that Garcia’s strong recent production in Cuba may somewhat overstate his polish at the plate, though, as he needs significant refinement as a hitter. Indeed, he struggled in a recent stint in Japan’s second level of professional ball. As always, you’ll want to read Badler’s report for a full breakdown.\n\nIn the aggregate, it’ll likely be some time until Garcia has a real chance of appearing at the major league level. Badler suggests he’ll likely be ready for an initial assignment in the upper minors, but even the start of his professional career could take a year or more to get underway — unless, perhaps, further rule changes ease the transition for players coming out of Cuba.
He certainly has a bright future, but it's difficult to see how he can advance within Indiana\n\nGovernor - The new GOP governor won 51.4 to 45.4 (lagged behind Trump's margin by a good amount, but he'll be the incumbent in 2020 and it will likely be difficult to unseat him. Might not be a terrible idea to run for this office in that cycle, though. \n\nSenate - Next opportunity is likely not until 2022. Todd Young defeated Evan Bayh 52.1 to 42.4, but he should have the incumbent's advantage when he's up for re-election. \n\nUS House - The current GOP rep for the district barely won Joe Donnelly's old seat (she won 49 to 47.6 in 2012 after he left it behind to run for Senate), but she followed that up with a 20-point win in 2014 and 23-point win last year. \n\nHe's only 35, so he has plenty of time to figure things out, but his options seem limited within his home state

And 52% WANT his advisers to be making the decisions (only 37% don't). Basically, most millenials think Trumpy is too stupid and unhinged to actually run the country, but other age brackets are more trusting. \n\nAlso,\n\n**Do you approve of the way the Republicans in Congress are doing their job?**\n\n18-34 = 17-72 (LMAO)\n\nThe Congressional approval #s are pretty bad in general, but the GOP's numbers among millenials are uniquely horrendous\n
O'Rourke is apparently a big advocate for term-limits and is acting on this principle by leaving Congress, even though he only arrived in 2013. He's [pretty solidly-liberal](http://www.ontheissues.org/TX/Beto_O`Rourke.htm) (as though it makes a huge difference in this race) and is a quality recruit for us, even if he's probably going to lose. He's also another Democrat who is young (44), but basically trapped in a red state. Even if he loses, he could have a bright future in the party. \n\nO'Rourke's House district is so blue that he did not even face a GOP opponent this year, so there's no risk of losing it. 
One of the most underrated, but critical, victories for the Democrats in recent years was the Pennsylvania Supreme Court election in 2015, which saw the Democrats [flip control of the court](http://www.dailykos.com/story/2015/11/4/1444191/-Democrats-flipped-the-Pennsylvania-Supreme-Court-gaining-control-of-2022-legislative-redistricting). So long as we keep that (and they can actually build their advantage this year), and the Democrats on the redistricting committee hold to the party line, we should be able to create far more appealing legislative and congressional maps in Pennsylvania after 2020.  
It could be close, but Al Franken won re-election easily in 2014, even as the Democrats struggled in many other races.

Correction: 54% of Arizonans don't want Trump to build that #FuckingWall
I'd say that there's no chance. I don't think GOP officials give a shit about Trump himself, but he would turn his supporters against them if they even hint at impeachment (we've seen it on the campaign trail). It's fear of the voters that will prevent the GOP Congress from doing anything. 
There are already 2 Dems in the race (St. Paul mayor Chris Coleman and former state Rep. Erin Murphy), with LG Tina Smith and AG Lori Swanson potentially joining the group. \n\nThe GOP has made huge gains in the state legislature over the past 2 years and actually currently controls both chambers. Taking the governor's office could give them a trifecta here for the first time since the 1970, so it's a huge race (all races are huge for Dems at this point, I guess, but losing ground in a state like Minnesota would be awful). The good news is that the GOP only has a tenuous grasp on the state Senate (1 seat margin) and that that chamber has been dominated by the Democrats basically continuously since 1970, with the GOP briefly taking control after the 2010 elections and again this past November. Thus, even if they take control, they probably won't be able to do a ton of damage. Still, I would not like for them to do anything at all, and we need to get people out in 2018. 
Snyder won by 18 points in 2010, but by only 4 in 2014. He won't be on the ballot this time, but his approval rating is garbage (40%, based on the last figures that I've seen) and it will hopefully be enough to vault a Democrat back into office. Midterms have not been friendly to us lately and Michigan is too purple for comfort, but Gary Peters won election to the Senate easily in 2014 and this should be winnable if we turn out.   
I know that some people are annoyed by presidential talk, but I was wondering if we could talk about some of the lesser-mentioned candidates for 2020. Booker, Gillibrand, Warren, Kamala Harris, and others are the big names, but I feel that there are some other names to consider and I'd be interested in hearing about them from people who live in their states (or know more about them). \n\n**Chris Murphy** - I honestly had not thought about him at all, but was inspired by his Twitter takedown of Trump this morning. I started looking into his record and found that he's had a very strong progressive record for years now, including advocating for legalizing same-sex marriage as early as 2002 (it was not yet legal at all in the U.S. and was still a very-unpopular position in many areas), speaking out against the current war in Yemen, opposing arming Saudi Arabia, etc. Murphy is young (43) and had always seemed charismatic when I saw him on TV, but hasn't received much hype yet (possibly because he's only been in the Senate since 2013) and I think that he soon might. \n\nPossible issues:\n\n1) He's another white guy - It's not a problem in itself (I mean, I am a white guy), but I think that it's time to finally elect a female president. I am torn on this, as I would love to have an opportunity to vote for Murphy, but I think that my fantasy scenario might be him joining a female nominee's ticket as VPOTUS, with an eye towards succeeding her down the road. He's on the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations and has [outlined a vision for a progressive foreign policy](https://medium.com/@ChrisMurphyCT/desperately-seeking-a-progressive-foreign-policy-b46bf45007a8#.lf9duy6j8), so perhaps an appointment as Secretary of State would be in his future, as well. \n\n2) He's a major gun-control advocate - It makes perfect sense, when you consider that Newtown is located in his old House district, but this could definitely be an issue for him in a presidential run. His views don't bother me, but it could turn other people off. Then again, I don't really believe that Hillary was much different on this and I don't really think that it was a major liability for her (the emails, Goldman Sachs speeches, and past TPP support might have hurt her more).\n\n3) He's had tax issues in the past (from Wikipedia), which could be embarrassing for a Democrat. But, he's apologized for it and I'm not sure that it would be a huge liability. \n\n**Tammy Baldwin** - The first step for her is obviously winning re-election in 2018, but I think that she may get some presidential hype after that.\n\nPossible Issues:\n\n1) If her [On the Issues](http://www.ontheissues.org/House/Tammy_Baldwin.htm) page is an indication, Baldwin is SUPER liberal. I don't  have an issue with that, but I wonder how it would play nationally. However, her past views on trade, especially, may put her over the top in the states that we need to win in the need next time (WI, MI, and PA)\n\n2) Is America ready for a president who is a single, childless lesbian? I think that many people these days would have no issue with it, but I still wonder how it would play. \n\nBaldwin is the most recent Democrat to win a major statewide office in Wisconsin and the people there did not have an issue with voting for a lesbian. However, she won by a small-ish margin in 2012 (5 points) and I'm worried that she will be vulnerable in 2018. \n\n**Amy Klobuchar** - Like Baldwin, she will be on the defensive in 2018. I think that she will likely have an easier time winning (Al Franken easily won re-election in the GOP wave of 2014), but we will definitely need to turn out the vote. \n\nPossible issue:\n\n1) I've liked what I have from heard from her whenever she's been on TV and she seems to have a solid overall record, but I'm a bit concerned that she will come off as a dull speaker to some people. I don't think that this is a major liability, but I think that others may disagree. \n\nMy final thoughts on the presidential race in 2020:\n\n1) Every time I've seen the topic raised, I see people arguing that we need someone who is super-charismatic in order to win (Cory Booker or someone with his charm), but I don't really buy it. I feel that we have reached the people that the Democrats could nominate just about any sane candidate and an enormous amount of people will turn out for them. I believe that we need someone who argues for our causes with passion, but that the most important "aspects" of a potential candidate should be minimal baggage and strong general competency.\n\n2) I'm not a fan of clearing the field, either. I don't know who will run in 2020, but I would welcome a field of 6-8 choices (not the 17-person clown car from the GOP last year), in order to see what they have to offer.   
Cheryl Turpin lost by 366 votes after pretty much [nobody in the bluest precinct in the district even bothered to turn out] (https://twitter.com/Taniel/status/818985203163078656). I don't know why these people skipped it or didn't vote, but this is fucking horrendous. If they have a valid excuse (I mean, it's a weekday, after all), then it's understandable. But we need to find some way to get our people to the polls. This shit just can't continue.   
This guy is apparently a young rising star within our party, but he has yet to serve beyond mayor of South Bend. His career path is unclear, as he's easily held on to the mayor's office in that city, but it's not easy to advance in Indiana politics as a gay Democrat. He should have a bright future in our party, but this is a pretty big leap. At the least, though, this could give him some more national exposure. 
I wasn't sure about a title, so I just went with the suggested one. However, I don't know if it fits the article. Despite what the title may suggest, Perriello is not nearly some far-left kook and I hope that people will give this interview a read. 
And the votes are starting to come in...\n\nEDIT: Decision Desk now projecting that Stephanie Hansen will win. Congrats to her!
Once again, the DailyKos election section is one of the best resources around. In this case, they've created a useful chart with the list of GOP reps in Clinton districts and how they performed relative to the presidential race. \n\nhttps://twitter.com/PoliticsWolf/status/828688344053866497\n\nAnd the master Pres-by-CD list \n\nhttp://www.dailykos.com/story/2012/11/19/1163009/-Daily-Kos-Elections-presidential-results-by-congressional-district-for-the-2012-2008-elections?detail=hide\n \nThis list of Clinton districts with GOP reps does not include IA-1, NJ-2, ME-2, NY-19, and NY-21, all of which went to Obama by at least 6 points in 2012 (plus others that he won by a narrower margin). The worst of these is IA-1, which Obama won 56-43 in 2012, but went 48.7-45.2 to Trump this time. The Democrats went after the GOP rep, but he was able to win by 7. However, he could certainly be vulnerable in a wave. \n\nAnd it does not include districts which Trump narrowly won (like MN-2, an open seat that went to Trump 46.5-45.3 and voted for GOP rep 47.1-45)
The average donation that he's received through DailyKos has been $18.57. He's now pulled in more than $562K from 30K donors 
I doubt that it will matter. He's raising money like other political candidates, but he also said that he's going to loan his campaign [$10 million](http://www.njtvonline.org/news/video/phil-murphy-becomes-first-candidate-2017-governors-race/) (and that was this past May) so getting name-recognition should not be an issue. Plus, a lot of voters in this race will likely vote for anybody with a D next to their name. 
I use [this extension](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/auto-unload-tab/) to unload all of my unused tabs after a set period of time (I go with 5 minutes). 
Nick Ward - \n\nSeason - 13.8 PPG, 6.6 RPG, 2.1 BPG, and 61.3 FG%\n\nLast 6 games - 18.2 PPG, 8.2 RPG, 2.8 BPG, and 65 FG%\n\nPer 40 (coming into tonight) - 29.9 PPG, 14.5 RPG, and 4.4 BPG\n\nWard is likely not athletic enough for the NBA at this point (given his size) and that's pretty great for us, as he looks like he could be an absolute stud for the next few years. His FT-shooting is pretty horrendous (honestly true about the team in general), but there is otherwise a lot to love about his game.  
Not sure if MSU commit Rocky Lombardi qualifies as one of the best QB recruits in the country, but I think that he can make a case for it.\n\n- 5* name\n\n- Prototypical QB size (~6'4'', 220)\n\n- Made it to the first portion of Elite 11 last year\n\n- Rocket-launcher for an arm ([he chucks one about 57 yards in the first highlight of his highlight video from 2015)](https://www.hudl.com/video/3/3047627/5721cb019a91677e749b7a27)\n\n- Strong overall athleticism (he's one of the best wrestlers for his weight-class in Iowa and demonstrates his speed in that highlight video)
These M.A.C. jerseys are pretty sick. 
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Popular_Vote_Interstate_Compact\n\nThere are efforts to join this group in many states, but it's obviously difficult at the moment. If Connecticut and Oregon joined (the best hope right now), it would push the number of EVs up to 179. \n\nEDIT: It's interesting that there's no effort to pass it in Delaware. Hopefully that will change if the Democrats retain control of the state legislature. 
I still think that there is no way. As long as GOP members of Congress remain afraid of pissing off his voters and spurring a primary challenge, I don't see him going anywhere, regardless of his actions or behavior. 
Not sure if you know, but there's been an effort in the courts to undo the current Texas legislative and congressional maps (as far as possible), but the case has dragged on for almost 6 years now. If it's ever resolved, and resolved in our favor, prospects for Texas Democrats may improve. \n\nhttps://www.texastribune.org/2017/01/04/analysis-dithering-judges-asked-rule-texas-politic/

Lol what are you talking about of course Republicans want gerrymandering, that's why they keep doing it.
Politicians do. I wonder if your average republican voter wants it (bet most of them dont even know what it is even).
Moon is an amazing human being.

Oh dear, this is a stupid one indeed.
No one WANTS gerrymandering. This is very much a bipartisan issue and should be talked about. Our whole system needs fixing.

"Picked someone to run" the only people picking Hillary are the American people who overwhelmingly supported her over her opponents 
the border should be open and they should be entitled to enter
Great, from a country with even worse immigration rules. Makes your comment so much more meaningful 
Just shut the fuck up man. I know you know the implication, we all know. I know you are not so clueless to think that what you described, I know you're not that dumb, please stop playing dumb
A this because bigger cities have more animals in their zoos?
I just can't fathom how people think they've met "the one good one". Like, how do they not realize that they are condemning thousands and thousands of good people who are just like "the good one" they know?
If by "nearly" you mean "fucking destroyed in a landslide"

Not wanting your rank to decay for no reason=your whole life is OW
I bet 0 Hillary voters ever did anything like the one posted 
\n\nThat sucks, I saw them in SF at their own headline show last Halloween and thought they were pretty good. And I thought Human Ceremony from last year was a pretty solid (not mind blowing or anything) record, but sucks that they weren't good when you saw them
You can tell this person isn't European when they say democrats are farther right than European right wing parties.\n\n\nCan't imagine the democrats supporting something like brexit 
Fuck em both
to be fair it did
Ive heard it but not from commies
They were writing angry letters? Wow, very helpful! I'm sure the conservatives are shaking in their boots
Yeah it's horrible. They're getting hit by the same rise in nationalism we are, but all "progressives" want to do is fight the democrats. Like fuck, the time for this was the last 8 years you can't fight us now, we can fight after we save the country

Ah yes, the guy who was honored by NAACP for his work in fighting racism after renouncing his racist past. Absolutely no reason the democrats wouldn't hate him but hypocrisy 
Remember when trump dragged Hillary for once saying in a leak she wanted open borders and free trade with all the americas, and she had to pretend to be against it for votes?\n\n\nI was like man, that makes me want to vote for her even harder, that sounds amazing

The original plan for the republicans was to run Rubio or Jeb to appeal to latinos (very religious, often conservative, big believers in hard work, etc).

Then they should have surrendered at the beginning 
So much better. Instead of defunding the EPA she would have begun her plan to install half a billion solar panels in the first year, thousands of Syrian refugees would have hope for a better life, Obama care would be expanding and millions of Americans would *not* be in fear of losing their access to healthcare, republicans would be promising to fight her liberal Supreme Court justice nomination, there would be no promise to fight states that legalize marijuana, no talk of defunding the entire state of California, no talk of deporting millions of undocumented Americans, she would have chosen a diverse cabinet, and of course people would be complaining some of her cabinet had had lunch with someone at Goldman Sachs a few years ago and whining about some emails
Well as a PoC it is partly cuz of our trade policy haha. But yeah, the racism is getting scary. Ever since election night I've thanked god every day that I was born in CA

Look, whatever we disagree with we're not getting the "real change" either of us want for a long time. Our country is facing perhaps the worst existential threat since the civil war we can't be fighting over shit like the tpp and free college 
Can we have broken social scene and father john misty too?
Are any of these even socialist countries? To be honest i don't know much about Cyprus but as far as I know most of those are socially democratic countries. But even if they were all socialist countries it would still be ridiculous to say Bernie is too far right for most of Europe in the midst of rising nationalism and brexit 
Millennial were massively against trump, the main issue is that not enough showed up to vote.\n\nIf only millennials voted in the general Clinton would have won 47 states

You know, almost everything about me suggests that I should be a Packers fan.  I'm intensely bothered by the way the NFL gives half the income to the billionaire owners - but Packers are owned by the people, give profits to charity.  I like teams that know how to be stable, stay the course, build through the draft - Packers never go into free agency, Thompson has been GM for over 10 years and that isn't ending any time soon.  I think teams that run more than pass are outdated at best, idiotic at worst - well the Packers have been heaving it up the entire time I've been watching football.  To put a cherry on top, the love of my life grew up in Green Bay, her parents members of the Packer band.\n\nBut I grew up in the greatest city in the world, Chicago.  FTP, Da Bears forever.

For all the helmets and padding, on an ethical level, it's not clear to me that watching football is any better than watching gladiatorial combat.  Regardless of whether this case turns out to be related to CTE on autopsy, the number of cases that already have been is upsetting.

The party without the white house nearly always makes gains during the midterm - they were complacent for the last 8 years, but as long as we keep this flame lit, it is entirely possible to chase a Democratic house in 2018.

They're specifically designed so that this can never happen.  Anytime a member starts to question whether they're really the baddies, *BAM* banned.  If you only allow those who are unquestioning in their support, the group is always going to be perfectly supportive.  If Trump gets impeached and removed from office, /t_d is going to keep chugging along, claiming some conspiracy theory was behind it, and continuing to support their "god-emperor."

People in general?  Once there's a smoking gun of clearly illegal behavior, or if his actual medical records come to light and reveal that he's in the throes of Alzheimers.\n\nMajority of his supporters?  I literally cannot conceive of an event that would cause them to turn on him.
His campaign statement that he could shoot someone on 5th avenue and not lose voters is, at this point, looking like an understatement.
I think every child should be raised rooting for at least one perennially unsuccessful team.  I loved rooting for the 90's Bulls, but if that was all I knew, I would have turned into a real piece of crap.  Instead, I went to plenty of Cubs games, they lost most of them, and I learned that life isn't just about winning - it's about playing, and trying.\n\nI of course welcome new Cubs fans, but they're never going to have the same sort of connection, the same sort of experience.

When I first moved into my own apartment, I decided to learn to cook by working my way through Modernist Cuisine At Home.  I didn't do it in order, and I didn't do everything - there's a lot of variations on themes - but I made sure to try a couple things from each theme.\n\nI highly recommend it; to bring something new into your repertoire, whether it's a tool, technique, or ingredient, you need to get a couple controlled trials under your belt, and working your way through a cookbook will do a great job of teaching you its themes.\n\nJust don't force yourself to make things you won't like, but do force yourself to try things that seem hard.

I'm against gun rights because I'm against guns, period.  I know the situation in this country is incredibly complicated, and I've never seen a specific new gun control proposal that would make a big difference, but I think that's in part because they're all trying to weasel their way around the 2nd amendment.
Welcome to the new world.  I gave my sister one of my old immersion circulators this Christmas, she's been loving using it.  Steak, eggs, carrots, reheating leftovers, chicken - the essential uses are plentiful, and 5 years on, I'm still learning new things I can do with it (I'm about to try making black garlic for the first time).
I feel for Knicks fans, but at this point, they're the ones choosing to remain fans.  You might be born with a fandom, but it's still a choice.  At this point, if I had been born a Knicks fan, I'd probably be on hiatus as long as Dolan owned the team.
The Correspondents Association isn't a branch of government; it's an independent organization run by the journalists covering the white house.  And given that Trump isn't particularly likely to attend, and he's doing everything he can to piss off the WHCA, why wouldn't they go with Colbert?
Made no statements supporting recreational marijuana...embraced the support of Chris Christie, noted hater of recreational marijuana...made Jeff Sessions attorney general...\n\nThere's being let down by Trump, and being let down by your overactive imagination.

How can scientific data go away with a political administration?
I'm very surprised nobody did the old reddit rose-a-roo here.
You left out hispanic.
Based on the polls (which whatever the Big Cheeto says, were reasonably close to the actual result), Stein voters heavily preferred Clinton, and Johnson voters narrowly leaned Clinton.  It wouldn't be certain, but in an election where only Clinton and Trump were on the ballot, her odds would have gone up.
Once I get started, I'm definitely planning on going in publication order.  I already know I love the world because I've loved all the adaptations, so I'd rather maximize references.\n\nJust need to find some time to read something new...
It didn't even get the right Columbia.  10 identically generic, poorly sourced entries on a list, and one of them is straight-up wrong.
Definitely not joking about the gentle difficulty curve - I was about to give up on it as entirely trivial, when finally I reached some really cool levels.  Well worth sticking with.
I'm a grad student; so, if you're just counting progress, and not effort...years?
To everyone saying they'll buy it for "ridiculously small price X" - Florida property tax is based on assessed value, not the price you paid, and is going to be mid-6 figures per year at a minimum. 
I believe in being kind to everyone; that the biggest problem with Trump and his supporters is a shortage of empathy for their fellow man.  So, I'm almost always against making fun of people online.\n\nBut how often do you get to make fun of actual, honest-to-god, modern day Nazis?
This is a man who the president of the United States respects and trusts as an information source.
How was the truffle salami?
I definitely didn't believe that this one was real.
Voting for Trump when you have a disabled child...hard to fathom.  I really hope the bottom doesn't fall out for them.
**Cosmic Encounter** would be the first game I re-bought if I lost my whole collection.  I'll never turn a game of it down.  It's the perfect weight, different every time, and I've never disliked playing it.  Runner up is Viticulture, which is both the heaviest game my family likes, and also great solitaire.\n\n**Mechs Vs. Minions** is an awesome co-op, and absolutely gorgeous.  This has just recently displaced TIME Stories in this category, which I still love, but hasn't had a module in a while.\n\n**Catacombs** is one that I've never been able to get my group to play.  I played myself to learn the rules, and I love it, but they don't like the flicking :-(
In terms of straight-up chucking, though, Curry is almost 10,000 behind Kobe.  He's also 1233 (so, 2-3 seasons) behind the current #184 on the missed field goals list, his dad.
It's embarrassing how little of LA that covers.
Is it worse that they gave it to him, or that they apparently kept it hidden for so long?  The former could just be incompetence, but the latter: it almost feels sinister.  I can't think of a single other extension in the NFL that was hidden for multiple months.
The guy he was replying to was using "fucked" with those very connotations.  I think the reasonable thing to do is assume he's using it in the same context, hence the reaction.
So, I'm an opponent of the 2nd amendment.  I live in California, and in the abstract, I support each of these things.  But in the aggregate, there are some alarming parallels between these measures and what's happening with abortion rights in states like Texas.  Why can't we just be honest about what is and isn't legal?
I hadn't ever heard of it before; dear god.  The last time I was this horrified by a new sub discovery was when redpill got started.
Their life story being public.  My nemesis has done plenty of shameful shit, let them be hoisted by their own petard.
In case you want to check that he actually did write 378 1's there, there's an easy trick.  See, there are 14 rows, and in each row, there are 27 1's, so the total number of 1's is just 14*27=378.
Think about what you know of Fraa Jad.  It's my opinion that he's incapable of being reckless.
Not quite; Ohio and Florida, for example, would still get attention from any national campaign.
I mean, they hit a wall efficiency wise; if they're getting touches, their fantasy points can be a less steep decline.  Matt Forte isn't the same guy he used to be but he had fantasy value this year.
Chef's knife (Misen)\n\nPressure cooker (cheap Presto model)\n\nHand blender (cuisinart, also has food processor attachment)\n\nBlowtorch (bernzomatic, with a Searzall attachment)\n\nImmersion circulator (Anova)
Yeah, I've already started monthly giving to the ACLU.  Hopefully the judicial branch weathers the storm enough for their impact to continue to matter.
I'm the owner of both big news RBs today: Melvin Gordon and LeVeon Bell combined for a very respectable 47 fantasy points.
I had Arizona, he had Rodgers and Ertz...but he benched Ertz and I won the championship by 8.
Bullcrap.  I've given out way less information about my next fantasy novel than Rothfuss has.  I doubt Pat is even in the top half of most secretive fantasy authors.
I moved here from Chicago, so parking has never stressed me out; LA and Chicago basically have the severity of parking and traffic swapped.
Makes sense; this way they'll be able to claim fraud in future elections, and there won't be any pesky independent authority to contradict them.
I'll start minding when they start outnumbering t_d in /r/all/top last hour.
Schwa is pretty creative; depending on the incarnation Elizabeth can get pretty molecular.
No, which is why their combination of rampant banning and upvote bots is particularly offensive.\n\nTheir way of going about things would be frustrating if they were a sub about gardening, let alone worshipping the worst president in history.
I found them in exactly reverse order.
He appears to be aware of the relevance of rain to growing crops...seems more qualified than the average Trump nominee.
They were talking like middle schoolers, but it was actually a group of high schoolers from PA playing right after school.
Much more trustworthy.  They're not the best, and they have a well-known house effect, but they are far above the "tries to do their job well" bar that tiny trump doesn't even notice overhead.
Low 90's
I would be feeling exactly the same way except...I have no confidence that this will do anything to take him down.  If it was actually a dealbreaker, it would have been one back during the campaign, when we knew 95% of what we already know.\n\nA president engaging in treason can no longer be considered concrete evidence that anything bad is going to happen to him.\n\nEdit: To be a little less apocalyptic: we have a not-crazy comparison to this in the Plame Affair.  Only Scooter Libby went to prison, and President Bush got re-elected.
According to the article, profits were north of a billion; so, less than 2% of the profits.
All 5 major teams have signed supporting this.\n\nAs a former Chicagoan, it certainly gives me pause, forces a re-evaluation of my support for them.
I've got too many old games to play.  I haven't bought a game at release in years, and see no reason to change that.
McMullin wasn't in any real swing states.  In terms of pure left-right support for Johnson, I'm sure you're right, but a deeply principled conservative isn't exactly likely to prefer Trump to anybody, and a chunk of them voted for Johnson.
Don't you think it's more likely that we'll just see politicians promising to bring back trucking jobs? Basically a repeat of coal in 2016? 
My draft contains a lot of candidates for my best move; Le'Veon Bell in the 1st, T.Y. Hilton in the 3rd, Melvin Gordon in the 5th, Travis Kelce in the 6th, Michael Crabtree in the 8th, Cardinals D in the 11th - this was my first year where almost all of my regular starters were guys I drafted.\n\nIn terms of worst move, it's either dropping Jay Ajayi, or keeping Tavon Austin until mid-November.
"Fucked" has connotations of being undeserved.  He'd be on more solid ground if he went with, say, "fucked up," but even then, the context of the discussion was of other schools getting unfairly punished on account of Baylor, and there's no way around that.
It's gotten distinctly worse lately; unfortunately we may be watching the game's death cycle happen very early, with bad servers pushing players away, and a lack of players killing the fun.\n\nWhen it works, though, it's great, so if these problems get worked out, I'll be shouting about it in the streets.
From what I can tell, it means US citizen.  According to the administration, white people aren't terrorists.
She didn't have the best people working for her.  The campaign went with its 2nd, 3rd, 8th choice for some positions, as Obama vets decided to sit this one out and support from the sidelines.\n\nThere's no one factor that led to this, which means every thing that could have helped, should have helped, and needs to be done better every chance we get.
I wasn't using hyperbole; I'm aware that there are differing magnitudes, but the underlying issue is the same: I'm paying to watch people suffer permanent traumatic damage.  Given that it still leads to premature deaths, the scaling down, even by a factor of 100, does close to nothing to assuage my conscience.
To be more accurate, it's how far I would walk just to be the man who walked 1000 miles to fall down at your door.  The waking up next to you is a certainty; the walking is a task undertaken for the sake of having done it.
None of this is secret info; it's all things we've seen from plenty of unverified sources before.  I happen to believe a majority of what he says here, but the post itself is basically pointless.
I've relied on the Ravens and Cardinals this whole way, and am strongly considering dropping both.  They each only have one good matchup left (Ravens next week against the Eagles, Cardinals week 17 against the Rams).  I'm not playing either this week, and I need to drop a player (I went without a punter in my game last week because I had already clinched my seed).\n\nWhich is to say: It's time to stream, baby!  I'm home!
Yes; when you go down the stairs that are halfway across the bridge, that leads to a ladder you can kick that goes down to that bonfire.
As currently played (where contact is non-incidental), similarly conflicted.  I've just never been as big a fan of those as I have been of football.
Tina's the best character, Gene is the funniest.
Some of it has come because he's been relatively (relative to other pro athletes) public about his conservative political views.
Yep, let's stick to the sexual assault that we have him on tape bragging about.
Pace doesn't want to pay him what he's worth, so he's not going to stay.\n\nIt's frustrating, because with $75million in cap space, there's no way that the $17million the franchise tag would take up is going to make the team better than Alshon would.  Instead, it's going to go to some other overpriced vet, except he'll be on a contract long enough for it to come back and bite us.

Thanks for the response, I was starting to feel pretty demoralized today. 
>Bernie says thing plz give me karma\n\nReally makes you think
So honest question, given that every thread posted here about Sanders is met with a series of attacks on him for being Independent, are Independents not welcome here? Or is it only because Sanders ran against Clinton? \n\nI'm technically unaffiliated with a party but support and vote Dem and have since I turned 18. I might've gotten crossed during the campaign thinking this was a hub for people that support Dems, as opposed to exclusively for party people. 
All you Bernie supporters do about the fact that he got smashed in the primary fair and square 
He actually quashed a request for him to join / create another party.  \nSo for all the people bashing him, he seems fairly dedicated to helping the Democratic party.
Then why doesn't he join the party?\n\nEvery day he spends as an Independent just encourages more young voters to go third party when we need as many Dem voters as possible. If he's really committed to the idea of unity against Trump then show it with action instead of angry tweets.
I don't know about all the 'damning research', but I know of a few examples you mentioned. With regards to Castro, he was trying to explain why the Cuban people weren't as hostile towards him as the USA expected despite the awful things he'd done. He talked about the social programs he set up and praised them but never said he approved of Castro over all and has since condemned the other horrible things he has done. Also Hillary did in fact bring this up at a debate. The 'rape essay' was weird but obviously wasn't condoning rape and rather commented on the complexity of humans and sexuality. Hillary never brought this up to her credit it but it was talked about in the media and it never gained any real traction. Plus it pales in comparison to Trump's words. I don't know enough about the rest to comment but given the scandals that both Trump and Hillary (rightly or wrongly) went through, I question how much of an effect they would have had. \n\nFurthermore, Bernie chose not to go after Hillary on comparable, illegitimate 'scandals' like the emails or Benghazi. He did go after her on corruption but I maintain this was a legitimate concern that many people agreed with him on and they deserved to have a voice. He also framed it as a problem with the government most of the time instead of focusing on Hillary. While Republicans might maliciously and hypocritically attack Hillary on this issue, it doesn't make it illegitimate. \n\nAs for Sanders not defending Hillary during the general, while it's always possible that he could have done more, I don't think it's fair to say he never spoke out. I think he did enough but I guess this is a subjective point. \n\nAs for Hillary staying to the convention, I never said she shouldn't have. She still technically had a chance, and so did Bernie. My main point was I don't think it would have made a difference when he dropped out. \n\nFinally, I am also upset about the Bernie voters that didn't vote for Hillary. However, my point was that this seems to simply be a standard occurrence in elections. There will always be people who refuse to vote for the person they lost to, I just don't see evidence of Bernie supporters being an extreme example. This also wasn't helped by all the faulty polls and predictions from news sites that claimed Hillary would almost certainly win. Also, I imagine that there would have been Hillary supporters who would have refused to vote for Bernie had he won the primary. \n 
Bernie is the man
>did he not campaign for Clinton\n\nDid he not give legitimacy to decades of republican slander?
There were a *lot* of things she could've pulled out against him. The clinton campaign (as well as the RNC) were sitting on some pretty damning opposition research they never pulled out, Burlington college,  the rape essays, the speech where he said jfk "made him sick" and praised castro, him saying "the american dream is best realized in venezuela shortly before their economy collapsed, him saying bread lines are good, and who knows what else. She didn't release it, though, because she feared it would alienate his supporters. \n\n\n>e kept on making the same points and the Republicans would have made the same attacks against her regardless of when Bernie dropped out\n\nthis is *exactly* what was wrong. If he had used left talking points like not enough support for social programs and stuff that would be one thing, but the fact that he gave legitimacy to right wing rhetoric was absolutetly critical to why she lost.Think of it this way, the Republicans claimed a lot of the exact same shit about obama, that he took too many donations, was corporate, blah blah blah. But democrats *never* fell for it, but this time around they did, and I would bet good money that this is at least partly because they saw someone on the left legitimizing those claims. \n\nAnd then, in ads and debates what does the Trump campaign do? What any republican would do, use *exact quotes* from Sanders himself to attack Hillary. And what do we hear from him? Nothing! Not one "oh what I meant was" or "it's not fair to say that now", not one peep.\n\n\nAnd for the record, Hillary stayed until the convention because she actually had a chance, in fact she beat Obama in the popular (a recurring theme for her career).\n\n\nAnd the vast majority of his supporters did go to Hillary, and I do respect that. But enough of them didn't show up, voted third party, or (a very small minority) flipped to trump to make her lose\n
Maybe don't run a negative campaign. Hillary somehow won without bringing up his massive negatives and opposition research on him (for party unity, something some Bernie supporters would never understand). And he could have brought things up besides reiterating the lies about her being corrupt (or my favorite criticism, "unqualified"), but *especially* don't do that after he knew he lost. I mean, what the fuck was he doing insulting her when he needed 75% in California to win the popular? He knew that would all be used against her, and it did, and now the country must pay 
He's not a democrat though 
> the campaign thinking this was a hub for people that support Dems, as opposed to exclusively for party people.\n\nThis is a pro-Democrat forum. As long as you vote for and support Democrats, you are welcome here. Your actual party registration does not matter.
Yeah, people can hopefully realize that the Democratic Party needs to unify no matter what. The stakes are too high for any party infighting, we can fight when trump is out of office and the democrats have control of congress 
The thing with a lot of the stuff I mentioned is that maybe there was an explanation, but as we've seen in the current political climate whatever explanation you have doesn't really matter, it's all about the optics of the initial public reaction (and some of them even with explanation I would find very questionable, but I suppose that's besides the point.\n\nThe major issues I had with sanders campaign gun was the accusations and implications of corruption, which were not policy issues and baseless, but more importantly probably what killed her campaign. Obama had very similar criticisms from republicans, but in 2008 and 2012 the left was smart enough not to listen, probably because there was no one on the left encouraging these kinds of claims.\n\n\nAnd the length of his campaign was an issue. As the convention neared he ramped up this kind of campaigning, and I maintain that had far less justification in staying in the race than Clinton did in 08. Clinton was in a much stronger position (again, having actually received more votes) while Bernie was riling up his base with assurance of a contested convention even as he required a 40 point margin in remaining states (including California, which he lost in double digits). Party unity would've been easier to achieve with an earlier exit from the race
If you honestly want a productive discussion then please don't call the moderate wing of the party 'weak', 'whiners' and 'moaners'.\n\nMy only point is that from our point of view his support is \nsuspect because he refuses to back up his words with actions and join the party.  If he is truly a democrat then why won't he?
If a green circle popped up and tried connecting you to random strangers, would YOU trust it? That's some alien shit. 
Those count as action when you're that famous.
They are not an action that shows commitment to unity in the Democratic party. If he wants to be a leader then let him actually show he can work with us instead of criticizing from the sidelines.
People are always going to feel as though attacks against their preferred candidate are unjust. From what I saw both Bernie and Hillary ran comparable campaigns in terms of tone and I don't subscribe to the idea that Hillary ran a purely positive, restrained campaign in the name of party unity. She did what she could to win and was more than entitled to.\n\nOn the issue of corruption, while you may think it was slander, Bernie had every right to run on the issue of money in politics and how he believes it corrupts the government. The fact is millions of people agreed with him. You may disagree with them, but to say he's not allowed to talk about it is in my opinion pretty undemocratic. A large portion of the democratic party wanted to get money out of politics and they had every right to be heard and represented. Furthermore, Hillary could have run on getting money out of politics in the general too, even if she still accepted campaign contributions. It's one of the most popular stances in politics and would have helped her. \n\nAs for not quitting while he had almost certainly lost, Hillary waited until the convention in 2008 as well. As for why he did it, he did it to try and influence the platform the Democrats would run on in the general. Maybe he was wrong to do that but I don't think anyone really voted based on the date that Bernie dropped out. It wasn't as if he revealed some secret, crippling flaw in Hillary in the final few weeks. He kept on making the same points and the Republicans would have made the same attacks against her regardless of when Bernie dropped out. Especially Trump who was already using similar rhetoric against his primary opponents. \n\n'Now the country must pay the price' implies Bernie caused her to lose. The fact is the vast majority of his supporters voted for Hillary in the general. More than Clinton voters who voted for Obama in 08 in fact. That also doesn't take into account the people who he brought into politics who may never have voted in the first place. \n\nThanks for your time, happy to discuss further 
I can answer that!!\n\n\nThe answer is YES.
Yup I agree. Hopefully this is just short term sour grapes and by the time the elections roll around again we can all call each other allies again.
I'm sure whining at everyone who didn't vote Dem is a good use of the run up to 2018. 
A lot of people don't trust anyone running for office to do what they say they're going to do. 
Give it time! 
Were you quicker at healing people than they were? That's a lot of overhealing, which reminds me of a lot of the heal sniping that goes on in WoW. 
Considering he's still working for the Democratic party I don't see how he abandoned it. 
You know I never considered my touring there was actually a bad thing. 
Abyss Watchers. Had no problem with almost anything else but they fuck me every time somehow. 
All these hard feelings are why they probably should've gone over the depth of the proposed battle system changes in the keynote. Surely they have them finalized, even just in planning. Maybe it wouldn't sting so badly for healers or tanks if they knew what changes were on the horizon for them. 
This would basically be it. For a whole lot of people, breaking the law is an excuse to let the government do anything it wants to someone. 
League of Legends. Owned nearly every champion until Jinx when I quit, and had at least one skin for all of them. Irelia, Janna, Ashe and Sona I owned every skin for. 
One of the things I really want to see the Guile theme applied to.
Pandaria map is to remind us of better days, Broken Isles map is to signify something is terribly wrong. 
We live in a nation of very blind people. 
Eh, when you can get your puppet to do it...
The latter. They're desperately trying to make it seem like people aren't upset with the current regime. It's all Liberal smoke and mirrors or something. 
I really don't know why you're making an argument in response to free and open borders, which nobody is advocating. \n\nOur values are enshrined in things far older than you, me or any living person. They cannot be easily eroded and worrying about that is beyond ridiculous. Our culture is not so precious as to turn our backs on people seeking a better life, especially not out of such fears. Our culture already dominates the globe, what more do you want? 
You should do it. 
I'd just like to see them add the cutscenes to the inn journal. 
I honestly do not believe they ever expected to have to back up their talk on Obamacare. It was really easy to shout from the back that it should be immediately repealed, but saying so (and doing so) upfront is a different matter. 
I just want a /cancelaura option for it. No need to remove it, it's pretty cool. 
Disappointed, but I guess it doesn't really matter. 
I remember watching him get attacked by Democrats on every single one of those points throughout the primary. You may ultimately be right that it was always going to be Trump, but you're absolutely wrong on the rest of it. 
Be careful what you wish for, look at what happened in Georgia in 2011. Imagine that nationally, and what that could do to the price of food and everything else. 
This sort of feeling reminded me of a bit Keith Olbermann did back during the Bush years, where he talked about the attack on Sen. Sumner in 1856. The story goes that Preston Brooks attacked Charles Sumner a few days after Sumner delivered an anti-slavery speech, beating him to near death with his cane and only stopping because his cane broke. The people of South Carolina responded by sending him new canes.\n\nIt reminded me of that because the atmosphere in the country feels a little like that today. It's been steadily getting worse since the turn of the millennium and it isn't really slowing down. The gulf between Americans seems to be growing with no end in sight. 
This entire scene just reminds me of VtM:Bloodlines https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyqKUmcb7-I
He just doesn't want the competition. 
Your quote isn't actually untrue honestly. Our recent wars impact very few of us and without constant news reports they completely drift away from public consciousness. 
Man here I thought there was virtually no daylight between all the different candidates. What is it? 
The right to vote is one of the things everybody is actually entitled to. Political opinions aside, that is the basis of at least 2 amendments to the US Constitution. 
I generally let people see it first, then explain important stuff. I've always been the type to want to see an encounter first so I give other people that same chance. 
This place is anti-Bernie. You're wasting your time. 
Went there honestly hoping it was real. Hopes dashed. :(
Retainer would be really cool. 
Anything is possible, but I'm not buying it just yet. 
Many of his supporters are, though. What use is shitting on them?
It's not really so bizarre, likely what happened is he wrote it off as shovelware but heard good things and wanted to see for himself without wasting money. 
Nice to see, we could use some more fresh faces running for things. 
I can't really list everything that they changed, but I can list a few that to me were important. \n\nOne is the power difference, not just in numbers but mechanics and the way the world handled itself with you. Mobs were more dangerous in the world, and not many classes could easily handle more than 1 mob at a time. While you can look at this simple thing as just taking out unnecessary grind, the thing is that it also removed any real threat the world posed to the player. Because of that a group of Defias in Moonbrook from old WoW were more threatening than Deathwing flying around one-shotting people.\n\nThey also scaled down elite quests at some point to no longer be elite, meaning that even without the power creep the mobs that used to give everyone trouble just didn't anymore. \n\nAnother thing they changed were old mechanics, that at the time a lot of us felt were kind of annoying and we wouldn't miss. I'm sure a lot feel this way still, but I look back on my old Hunter and I feel something valuable was lost in the transition. \n\nThe old Hunter had a spell dedicated solely to teaching their pet ability ranks from other pets, or from trainers. You had very limited stable slots, so you mostly focused on one or two pets at most. This meant that your pet mattered to you, it had value because you'd sunk time into it. A lot of us would go out to try to get special looking pets as part of that. Now they're fashion accessories, they change with the transmog and are easily tamed/tossed without any thought. They don't matter to the Hunter any more, and Marksman even remove theirs entirely for the best DPS. That's an entire element of that class totally gutted because it was a bit clunky, but with it went a little bit of the class's soul.\n\nAmmo is a little similar for me, because while it was 100% an undue burden on the Hunter and very annoying to have to dedicate an entire bag to it Hunters also got a unique look out of it. Quivers were removed a while back, now only on the MM Artifact, when before they appeared on anyone with one equipped as a bag. \n\nMostly what they've done over the years is pull the RPG out of the game. The removal of reagents, ammo, relics, flavor things for the various classes and the weakening of the world's threats have all turned it into a theme park. Show up for a while, see what's new and then unsub until they add more. This game no longer offers you another space to "live" in, like older MMOs used to. You have no community, the world is a background thing that serves as drapery to show you pretty things from point A to point B, or to look at while in queue.\n\nAnyhow, this might be a bit hard to follow or jumbled. I'm running on low sleep and a lot of tooth pain. 
That didn't take very long. 
They're working through a pretty large grudge at the moment. 
Embracing the idea of the "Alt-Left" lets conservatives set the tone and control the language, again. Knock it off. It's not real and should never be real. \n\nWhile we're at it, stop letting them own the constitution, freedom, liberty and all that too. 
Dems would gladly accept the ammunition given by no replacement plan. 
Alright, we're chosen undead!
Maybe we could all respect him as a strong virile man if he sexually assaulted them like big daddy Trump. 
When I have a shitty day I'll watch this as a gif and giggle. Thanks guy who punched a Nazi. 
He absolutely did, which is why he complained a while back that he would've won the popular vote if not for a bunch of illegal votes he made up. 
Man that beginning war is kind of rough for the Enchantress, just had Orion bring Tilea, Estalia and all elf factions into that conflict before turn 10. You aren't kidding, this shit is brutal. 
That is genuinely funny. 
My FC went with the lavender beds, and I've regretted it ever since. Goblet forever. 
I tried really hard to focus on the story in ARR, didn't really succeed and when they killed Haurchefant in Heavensward my reaction as a result of that was kind of like "thanks I guess? who were you?"\n\nHeavensward I didn't so much have that issue, thankfully. My hope is that Stormblood keeps up Heavensward's story quality. 
Our values are to welcome immigrants. They don't need to come from places that strictly share our values, because they will come to share them in time. That's generally how it's always been in the US, even after we treat each new group as subhuman. 
Ah well, enjoy that profit motive guys. 
Unless you get ganged up on as the Fey Enchantress, it's probably a good idea to just snipe the rebellion stacks as they come out instead of ending the event. I ended up with a ton of traits doing that earlier today. 
So just package and ship Flint's water? I'd be down with that. 
Won't someone please think of the sexually frustrated? 
Really hyped but I can't help but hear a little movie cheese in this dialogue.
They'll blame Obama and point to how Obama blamed Bush for the recession as precedent then pretend they caught Liberals in some crazy lie. 
Sanders article comment section without the Enough Sanders Spam screeching? What?

Do you mean the tornado around you when it procs? If so, yes please. It might not have been a modern spell effect, but it was so iconic of Enhancement. 
Dude never stops looking like a rock star. 
So is this a full second game, or a large expansion release for this? Like are we talking about 60 bucks, Total War: Warhammer 2? Or something like Legion for WoW? 
Completely unimportant. 
Is her ignorance willful or due to her life of luxury? 
I really hope they don't start bowing down to him for access. 
As a long time healer in MMOs your entire healing philosophy baffles me. 
Actually that would be fucking brilliant. 
This quest really makes it seem like we all have ADD. 
Yeah, I'm totally fine with it. Otherwise cool ideas could get cut or crap could get hoisted onto a class just to put them up to par. 
I've been using mouse over macros since BC. I've never ran into a better method for healing, to the extent that I don't know why it isn't a default control scheme in MMOs these days.  \n\nWASD for movement, 1-5 + alt1-5 or ctrl1-5, R, V, Z, X for spells. 
An America where all immigrants were fully assimilated sounds incredibly boring. 
Bard is pretty easy.
Okay. Hopefully cooler heads prevail, or 2018 is already down the drain. 
It's a breach of our values. It doesn't need to come down to an argument of rights. 
To be honest that second quote isn't actually that outlandish. Trump spent so much in a month that the number SEEMS fake, despite not being fake. Especially when they spent so much time trashing Obama's vacation expenditures. 
This is how I feel if his supporters are ignored.
So they voted against their interests? 
This will never matter to anyone who supports this ban, unfortunately. 
You can get it, you need the RBG rating for it though.
That was during the primary, which is just that kind of contest. Now we're out of that and we're the losing party, and we're kind of burning down. What's the point in hurling dirt at people under the same roof now? \n\nBut honestly fuck it. By all means, keep trashing Sanders supporters. Alienate them as hard as you can. 
Really disappointed that they didn't show the comparison of the Women's March killing puppies and the March for Life helping old ladies cross the street while also curing cancer. 
Nothing eventful happened and I'm mostly puzzled on why someone is responding to something 2 months later. So I guess pretty well? 
Unlikely. Was fun at first but kind of wore thin quick. Can only watch people benny hill around a map so much before it stops being funny. 
I'm only slightly over 30 at this point and have been feeling this way for a few years too. Mostly play strategy games and anything with a good story or even good story moments. \n\nI think I just stopped enjoying trying to rank myself against other people all the time. I don't really care any more, and I find working with other people a more enjoyable activity in games. Games with good narratives also offer a lot of conversation material with friends, and that's lead to more introspective and retrospective good times than competition ever did. 
SCOTUS would probably enjoy knocking that one down.
Good lord reading his direct quotes hurts my fucking head.
Why would California do that? 
Even when he's gone they can't let him go. 
We are the bitch here after all. 
Depends entirely on how it plays. If it plays like most of the post 50 classes, probably not. 
Honestly, that's pretty cool. 
Check to make sure you've got everything you want from inside the main building too. There's some good stuff in there for glamour. 
He sheathed it, they were showing off the Iaijutsu skill. 
Fuck off don't speak for the rest of us. 
He will kill again. 
Dammit I *did* mean days instead of hours. I spent even longer than I thought!
This sounds like a real mess. Honestly the best option at this point might be to flash a RUU and start over from stock.\n\nYou don't really have enough info to work out what exactly is going wrong here.
You can see the full article if you Google the headline then click on the link. NYT only blocks you if you don't link via search engine.
In addition, this is an issue of selection bias. There are no records of the trees/insects that didn't encounter big globs of resins, so when we look back there appears to be a disproportionate amount of amber records. \n\nFinally the entire amber record covers a period of millions of years. Even a very low rate of fossilisation will produce a large number of viable fossils over that timespan.
Very glib, but I already agree with you. You need to convince the Republicans.
There will always be Muslims in Europe. I don't see any benefit to discussing this honestly.
Damn good phone. Shame it looks like the last decent one HTC will end up making.
I agree it's *technically* possible, but it's still politically impossible.
I think I may have found a depository of RUU zips for the EU M9, see [here](https://www.androidfilehost.com/?w=files&flid=28212).
Scarface the Market Tested McGee.
Sorry,  doesn't seem to be. I found a [RUU depo](https://www.androidfilehost.com/?w=files&flid=31399) for the asian M9s, but none seem to be Nougat so far.
I have fond memories of that scene with him and Brent Corrigan from when I was younger.
I laughed when Sy thought he'd look like a tit if he kept waiting for the lights to go off. Acknowledging that he can fuck up makes him so much more real as a character.
When the show is on and producing new content it's usually a decent community, but at the moment they can only circlejerk over stale jokes and their own opinions. And the target demographic doesn't tend to the most progressive opinions. 
I've ordered one for Xmas. Looking forward to the unboxing!\n\n[In the meantime here's a video. :)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUCNtXrpe-M)
I love seeing these conflicts between the casual users and the obsessives - there's no end of drama.\n\nThe casuals browse Reddit, and absently upvote any anti-Trump headlines they see before moving on.\n\nAs comments take more work than voting, the obsessive users then freak out in the comments and hysterically blame mods & shills.
Heh, Hillary is practically a sot! One of her more minor scandals had her accused of alcoholism.
The theory of the four humours is ancient and the exact origin is unclear, but the root of the Greek theory is generally accepted to have come from a text called *The Hippocratic Caucus*, which might not have been written by Hippocrates himself but certainly came from his school.\n\nIt's worth noting that the theory was finalised in Western medicine by the writings of Galen in the second century, who would act as one of the most prominent medical authorities all the way until the sixteenth century.\n\nThat said, I remember GCSE History. If in doubt go with what's in the syllabus and study guides, that's what they'll be looking for.
[Yep](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ikorolkov.poweramp.skins.material&hl=en_GB)!
I have that exact model too! Very happy with it so far, only real downside is HTC's slow updates for the international version. \n\nThe HTC 10 isn't the best in any particular category but I've found it to have no major flaws. For a daily driver you can't ask for much more.
Even if it's a financial loss for him *he should still do it* - holding onto them might not be illegal but it's still immoral to have such blatant conflicting interests. He could even spin it as a sacrifice he made for the public and boost his polls! Every former President with business holdings has relinquished them, all he's doing is saying that he holds his own funds above the public interest. Or are you saying it's actually legally impossible for him to do so?
And when you consider that 2016 was decided by a margin around 2% in three key states it's very easy to see how the relatively small impact of voter ID laws can essentially swing an election. 
Because srs isn't really an issue. They used to be in the early days of Reddit when it was much smaller, but it has nowhere near as much influence as it did. \n\nSRS brigading is essentially a meme at this point.
Perhaps I'm just locked in my own bubble, but I haven't seen as much fake news on the left. 
I'm not an expert so I can't guarantee anything, but it is extremely likely.
IMO it was a valid artistic choice. The tone of the film was less about "The wonder of first contact" than it was about the implications, fear, and mystery of meeting something truly *alien*. I think the overcast shots suited it wonderfully. 
Well it started with Harambe and it's been all downhill from there. Did you somehow miss Brexit and Trump?
I like the drama that comes from having him there but I really dislike *him*. Bastard.
I'm not saying play nice with the racists, fuck them. I'm gay, I know there are some things you don't compromise on.\n\nBut instead of taking the ball and going home, we need to make our voices heard in whatever coalition ends up in power once the Dems have reorganised. 
Honestly it might be a physical issue. Maybe your headphone port has worn down enough that it can't make the connections anymore?
Have to say, I'm really liking the original animation they're using these days.
Notice the lack of exclamation points, the absence of SAD!! Wonder if he wrote this himself?
If Ford has any scenes at all then we'll drown in the obscure literary quotes. I'll need a new liver for certain.
Locking up someone on your side because they failed? That sort of hate and division is what we should be avoiding now. The Democrats need to be united in some way, and there's no way to do that if her supporters are demonised. Many of us supported her *over* Bernie.
It's mostly JRPG's in my experience for some reason.
I'll check when I'm back at my PC. Thanks for the help!
That's a interesting viewpoint, but I'm uneasy with it if it's true. \n\nIt sounds like it could be used as a justification to allow future insurgent movements to establish themselves as a quasi-state before we attack them, because that's easier to fight.
And another note, people who think that because others don't agree with their own methods they don't share the same goals. \n\nSo much political argument is between those who have 90% in common and fight to the death over the last 10%.
In the primary, not the general. Since only Democrats voted in the primary it didn't reflect the views of centrist or Republican voters - the ones they need to win over.
I don't understand how some people on the left have no empathy for Hillary honestly. She's worked tirelessly for decades to try and champion progressive views as best she can, to get something *done*, and lost her legacy to a reality TV star. I've always appreciated her focus on results over flash and the fact she lost has made me much more cynical about the election process.\n\n
Hm, sometimes full OS updates on Android can cause odd bugs.\n\nIf nothing else works the most reliable way of sorting misc. problems would be a factory reset - it'll delete your data but it sorts most issues.
Ikr? Nice to have some meat and two veg on the front page for a change instead of melons.
Sounds like the system partition got wiped or corrupted.\n\nThe good thing is you have TWRP, so you can just flash a NANDROID backup and restore it. There's a depository of backups [here](http://forum.xda-developers.com/one-m9/general/stock-nand-backup-ota-update-collection-t3132698), in the second post.\n\nYou need to find the right backup for you using your CID and software version, then restore in TWRP using that file. If you want to keep your user data then TWRP should give you the option to restore just the system partition.\n\nThat said, if you're uncertain about your software version or anything then you can flash a RUU and return *everything* to stock. HTC makes RUUs for the US publicly available from [here](http://www.htc.com/us/support/rom-downloads.html). This will delete your user data.
Here's the thing - I have genuinely never understood why people dislike Hillary. The entire election I was trying to work it out but I've never been able to nail down the exact reasons, everyone just acts like it's obvious. Evidently this whole feeling went much further than I thought and I was wrong. Can anyone describe why they didn't like her? I want to understand. 
I want to ask you to please stop focusing on Clinton's faults. She's done.\n\nAt this point, we can't disagree. She wasn't the right candidate for this election. But she's political deadweight now and she will never be an important figure in the Democratic party again.\n\nAt this point we all need to stop blaming each other and hurl about these negative comments. They divide the left when we should be coming together to work on 2018 and 2020.  
Relax. The fact that you've recognised it is already a huge step, so congrats!\n\nIt sounds like you've been thinking about this for a while and honestly these kind of negative thoughts tend to fester if you linger on them, it's just human nature. You need to change the way you're thinking about this.\n\nIt sounds like you're unhappy because you don't like yourself, and you're never going to find anyone if you don't honestly believe you deserve it. So work on your self image first, then you can move forward.\n\nWork on your appearance until you're genuinely happy with who you see in the mirror. Throw yourself into your hobbies until you've done something you're proud of. The point is just to do little things to prove to yourself you can change, then you can work up to the big changes. 
I tried installing it but couldn't see the H. Does it show on a certain screen?
You can't reason someone out of a position they didn't reason themselves into.\n\nPeople aren't homophobic because of logical reasons, they have an emotional hate against us then construct elaborate semi-logical justifications. The only way to counter homophobia is with emotional arguments, by demonstrating that we're people and not caricatures. 
 
Can you link a source? There's no point to these threads if there's no evidence for either side.\n\nI do recall a video of it making the rounds when it first happened.
Is anyone else a bit worried that the finale can't possibly meet our expectations? 
I don't have that issue myself, but the RUU should fix this.\n\nRUUs re-flash every part of the phone's software, including the firmware, so although it wipes your user data it fixes almost all software problems as well.
Theresa May was Home Secretary before she became Prime Minister - in charge of crime, immigration, and law and order.\n\nThe Snoopers Charter was first introduced by her back then, it's something of a pet project for her, and she's always had an obsession with security and surveillance over freedom.
Yeah I thought it was along those lines but it didn't make sense to me. What about Jessie? 
Can you provide any evidence that this is correcting a preexisting problem?\n\nBecause from where I'm standing VOICE is trying to demonize immigrants so Trump can use them as a hated scapegoat for cheap popularity.
To actually answer your question OP, there is currently no stock Nougat Roms available outside the US that I can find. I guess if you're s-off you could change your CID to the developer version and flash that, but I haven't seriously looked into it. \n\nHonestly it would be simpler to wait. It shouldn't be longer than a few more weeks plus you wouldn't lock yourself out of future OTAs.
La La Land really helped when I saw it last week!
Legally it makes little difference, but it will affect the general reception to his administration.
There's a good chance his staff have caught onto this trick and bought a few cheap Androids to use when posting in Trumps name. Add a bit of authenticity for the obsessives like us.\n\nI mean, Trumps an idiot but I can't believe that not a single member of his team has heard about the metadata trick.
I don't think we need to get too up in arms about this, aren't we trying to unify now?\n\nPersonally I've always been a bit of a Bernie-skeptic but I never disliked the man or his supporters, I just had doubts about his ability to deliver on his promises. \n\nHe always struck me as a man who's heart was in the right place and was hugely passionate about his beliefs but didn't fully appreciate the details of what he'd need to do to make his vision happen.
Manning has been experiencing particularly brutal incarceration, largely due to being a transgender woman stuck in a male prison.  The severity of the imprisonment shouldn't affect these decisions I admit, but I do wonder if it was a factor.
Dude, context. Can't we put politics on the back burner for one post?
But it isn't a fallacy. To take an extreme example, North Korea has one of the worst governments on earth with extreme fascism, media control, and internment camps. But it would still be wrong to slaughter and torture the North Korean citizens in retribution as they are not responsible for the actions of their government.
She isn't that pretty, by leading actress standards. Some decent makeup effects and costuming could easily sell loser!Taylor imo.
First of all, thanks so much for actually putting that down. Given the emotions in this election it's v. hard to find decent conversation that doesn't break down into name calling and spite.\n\nThat said I don't agree with the statement that she was a terrible candidate - I think she was the best candidate there was according to the information available at the time, even if that info turned out to be wrong.\n\nSince fake news is everywhere and the msm is bullshit I've been trying to find primary sources for everything. [Earlier in the year this very comprehensive study was down about voter attitudes to all the different candidates in the general electorate.](http://www.people-press.org/2016/01/20/voters-skeptical-that-2016-candidates-would-make-good-presidents/) Hillary was the single most favourably regarded candidate on either side of the aisle, with Trump trailing and Bernie behind him.\n\nAccording to every conventional reading she was a good candidate. But no one anticipated it would be such an unconventional election.
If the Democrat's don't appeal to the centre and regain lost voters then they will lose 2020, no matter how legitimate they are, that's just political fact.\n\nIt's clear the current establishment is done but going full left-wing Tea Party is the wrong move.
Clinton didn't visit Wisconsin because every piece of polling evidence her campaign had showed it as being safe. [Have a look at this piece from Forbes.](http://www.forbes.com/sites/realspin/2016/11/30/in-wisconsin-clintons-pre-election-poll-numbers-were-accurate/#60990d5e291e)\n\nThe pre-election polling was accurate for Clinton's percentage vote but it was completely off for the number of independent voters that went to Trump. True, Clinton should have campaigned in Wisconsin in hindsight but her campaign had no possible way of anticipating this could happen.
Urgh, I wish you were wrong. It's depressing to be part of the 48% here at the moment.
I'm glad to hear you say that. Usually in political conversations the most reasonable people are the ones you never end up hearing. 
Obama only had a majority for *four months* out of eight years - September 24, 2009 through February 4, 2010. And in that four months he managed to pass Obamacare, the most far reaching healthcare reform in decades, which would have had a public option if a single Blue Dog Democrat (Lieberman) hadn't voted against it.\n\nThere are many reasons Dems didn't get the House but the main two are (i) Dems grew complacent in mid-terms as they thought they'd won the war with Obama's inauguration, (ii) Repubs gerrymandered the hell out of it in 2010.\n\nAt least do basic research first.
I thought we were discussing Russia, not Islamic extremists.
Uh, what was Sy alluding to with Mabel?
Actually I think this could be the one twist we wouldn't see coming.
I want single payer as much as you, but I don't know what the perfect solution is, I wish someone knew. \n\nDemocracies are all about compromise, but one party refuses to compromise on anything based on an irrational ideology that puts party ahead of country. There's no reasoning that can work with that. \n\nAnd in response, the left seems to be splitting apart between centrists (because they can't get anything done), and left-wing purists that will make the partisanship even worse.
I dunno, speaking as a Brit a lot of us are shitting our collective pants at the moment. Brexit might work out, but it doesn't look very optimistic for Remain or Leave.
What the hell do the policies of her parents have to do with Chelsea? She's her own independent person, and damn smart from what I hear from her.
You can find a stupidly comprehensive guide to the process [here](http://forum.xda-developers.com/one-m9/development/firmware-t3068243), just skip to the HowTo. You can use this method even on an S-ON phone since the RUUs I linked to are security signed. \n\nA RUU zip file is essentially a zip file containing stock images of *every* partition on your device (including the bootloader and recovery), and encrypted so only your device's bootloader can open it to read it. When you flash it, it will return your phone to 100% stock and wipe anything else. \n\nKeep in mind you might need to flash that file twice in a row - the first flash updates the bootloader, then the second flash updates everything else.    
The spirit of the Millennium Ring, (realising that if he were to change hosts it would cost the animators money) summoned an Ancient Egyptian Plot Hole to return the Ring to Bakura's bedside table. Bakura then resumed wearing it without question, as he had no other pieces of bling that went with his outfit.
Politics affects people's lives, you need a certain level of respect. When Trump's decisions will change the lives of *millions* he must be taken more seriously than some kind of reality TV star.\n\nAlso, Trump is going to have complete executive power for the next four years, and with a Republican legislature there's going to be few limits to what he can do. How can he be held accountable if his followers are blind to any of his faults and refuse to believe he could make any mistakes?
I blocked it from my feed when they introduced the feature, been very happy since. Are they shitposting again then?
We wouldn't make a very good Project Caterpillar would we?
Well when they let you down, the morning rolls around & it's another day of sun!
Wish I had more news on when the international 10 gets the update. It's starting to get annoying.
There's few actual logical defences of Trump's policies, and the best counter they have is blaming the enemy.\n\nAnd now that Trump's actually in power and has to back up his empty promises with actions they have a *huge* amount of things to defend.
The Episode 10 preview had a shot of Clem standing there, intact. Bernard is deader than disco.
Huh, sounds interesting. Do you need to be a mod to get that part of the extension to work?
The three tests loosely follow the pattern of past, present and future.\n\nThe first test would show Elayne's commitment to the White Tower measured against her history. Gawyn and Morgase would be in danger, perhaps with Caemlyn under siege from the False Dragon Logain. Elayne must leave them to their unknown fate to proceed.\n\nThe second test would measure her commitment versus her current life. Her new friends Nynaeve and Egwene are under attack in the White Tower from the Black Ajah, she must leave them to face possible torture and Turning to proceed.\n\nThe final test sets her against the future. Queen Elayne of Andor and the Dragon Reborn, Rand al'Thor stand against the Shadow at the Last Battle, joint leaders of the free world. The tide of battle turns and Rand is wounded and trapped, causing the morale of the Andoran army to break. Elayne must leave the fight when Andor most needs her, when Rand most needs her.          
Oh I know. I just think we should work with as much info as possible.
Ouch. Have you trying flashing the RUU zip through fastboot? 
Uh, what device are you using? What software version? Have you updated the system recently?
 
Hillary is far from spineless, she just refuses to pretend something is possible when it isn't. People can hate the situation all they want, but single payer healthcare is politically unfeasible in the current climate.\n\nShe tried ambitious healthcare reform in the '90s and failed because she didn't recognise the realities at the time, then learned from it.
I don't deny there's probably some degree of manipulation from both sides to varying degrees.\n\nBut the average anti-Trump post consistently reaches several thousand upvotes once it reaches r/all. If it was majority astroturfing the comment sections would be far more conflicted about it. \n\nAtm I think it's fair on average to say the average Reddit user just dislikes Trump. :/
It was a production meant to highlight minority issues, how is this an issue?\n\nI mean, if a movie only has black characters in the script you don't get on their case for refusing white actors.
... dude what did I say about unifying?\n\nFor the record I agree with that article - it's actually one of the ones that cemented my opinion of him - but sharing that doesn't achieve anything now. \n\nThe left needs to build bridges and focus on what we share instead of the minor flaws. We have four years now to sort out the fine details of what policies we'll do when we're in the White House, for now we urgently need to work on the broad strokes of the ideas and causes we'll unify behind.\n\nIf this election has made anything clear it's that we currently have no consensus on what the Democrats actually *stand for*. And we need the Bernie supporters to be willing to come to the table.
I agree. When you criticise Wikileaks people seem to think you're criticising some platonic ideal of transparency, when the organisation itself is oddly secretive about its own processes, and is biased enough to sell "Bill Clinton Dicking Bimbos" t-shirts.\n\nThere are several legitimate criticisms of Wikileaks and it's tiring to be shouted down when you mention them.
I thought Elizabeth Warren would be able to win, then I realized she was a woman. It would be best if we got a white male progressive for the Democratic nomination, like Sherrod Brown or old Bernie.
"Historically, Mexico and Canada have always been a part of 'America'"!  \n\nWhat is Trumpspeak for "Anschluss"?
I'm worried it will come down to a pissing contest over who has been most anti-Trump. It needs to be who can articulate the clearest, most appealing vision, one that cuts through the insanity and comforts voters. So far, Bernie has that, but others might.
2016 races should be focus, and then 2018. \n\n

If your constituents are angry at you, you might be doing something wrong.
The weekend before the election I drove through rural Pennsylvania to go camping.  Saw a lot of Trump signs all over the place, some even large and homemade (unusual), but the kicker was the person who built a six foot cube prison cell in his front yard with a Hillary mannequin sticking her head out and a handmade "Hillary for prison" sign.  Damn.  What a neighborhood that must be.\n\nI am very curious to know how his supporters are feeling now.  My opinion is that he is single-handedly obliterating everything that has made America great in years past.  It will take decades to undo the damage even if Congress flips in the midterms, and most people won't be able to make the connection on why things are as bad as they are years down the road.
Rick Perry is Energy (national labs and nukes), not EPA.  Pruitt is EPA.
I've heard a new employee doesn't pay off until about six months into a job.  This is really risky for your career since you may also have screwed your current employer out of their second choice for your position by accepting and then immediately quitting.  Do you hate your current job enough alreadyto quit and risk the damage to your professional reputation?\n\nThat said, you always need to look out for yourself.  But I typically say that only when someone's been at a job for long enough to know their employer isn't treating them fairly.  \n\nWhy wouldn't you wait for your dream position if it was only three weeks?  Did you tell them you had to make a decision?
You don't know what bipartisan means.
Orphan drugs are how Shrkeli/Turing, Valeant, and Mylan were able to jack up drug prices obscenely, because they had no competition.  Rejiggering the exclusivity clause to allow other entrants to the market would keep downward pressure on prices.\n\nI work in pharma so I know more about this than Trump.  Gutting the FDA would disrupt the industry.  Regulations exist for a reason.
Pearl S. Buck???
Most corrupt non-President in history!

Maybe post this to /r/photography or /r/history too?  The color tint of the photo might be a clue for an expert.
The Daily Mail?!
Check out [PresidentialTrump on Twitter](http://twitter.com/maturetrumptwts?lang=en).  Parody account, but damn what a difference.
This could be a very interesting Supreme Court nomination hearing.  I would love to see the Dems grill Gorsuch on what the country's recourse under the Constitution would be if a President made himself an autocrat and the Congress didn't impeach and try him.  It would be a textbook civics lesson, on which half the country apparently needs a refresher.
"Extreme vetting" from a man who keeps his business deals and tax returns from the American people.  You first, Donny.

I hear they are also the number one exporter of potassium.
Eh, voters in South Dakota and Oklahoma (both red states) voted for tougher ethics laws for their state lawmakers...and now those state lawmakers are trying to repeal the new laws the voters just specifically approved.  The will of the people is being ignored by their legislators.
Just emailed him via his website.  Will try to call tomorrow.  Fingers crossed - surprised to learn he was a potential vote against.
Or Tom Jones for an older generation.\n\nAlfred Russel Wallace was the only scientist on the Wikipedia list that rang a bell to me.
Or anything good, period.
Very special.
"State Sen. Ralph Shortey said people didn't understand what they were voting for"\n\nJust like the South Dakota lawmakers who are throwing out the voters' approval of tougher ethics laws.  [Source](http://www.npr.org/2017/02/01/512730065/south-dakotans-voted-for-tougher-ethics-laws-but-lawmakers-think-otherwise)\n\nWhen you overrule the voters, you better be prepared to face some consequences.
I would be very curious to hear if an atheist from one of the listed countries were denied entry while a Christian was admitted.  That would be a perfect 'religious test' case for a lawsuit against the order.
Can't wait for someone to post one of Trump's old tweets with a misattribution to one of his "enemies" and have him react against it.
"Were you aware that a poll was released revealing that a majority of Americans actually supported President Trump's temporary restriction executive order?"\n\nTextbook begging the question ("Have you stopped beating your wife?") right there.
With a Republican Congress and soon to be a conservative Supreme Court, you better hope more of them stand up like this or there will be no check on Trump or Trumpism.  McCain and Graham in the Senate have been speaking up (maybe others).  I hope we all agree that autocracy is out of the question for America.
Yes, but it was closed in preparation for the transition, at a time when Obama would not be able to do anything.  (Note that neither of the Snopes sources cited is free of bias.)\n\nNevertheless, it's clear where Trump's priorities lie since he's signed plenty of executive orders since his inauguration, but still has not brought the comment line back up.  I am not sure how comments submitted to The White House by phone under Trump will be handled if it was handled by volunteers in Obama's administration.  I am curious to see if the "We the People" site survives since the top two petitions are antagonistic to Trump.
Longer than that.  It goes back at least to Gingrich in 1994.
Every good Hosptie
You read the comments?  You are a braver man than me.
I can see from your post history that you frequent The_Donald.  Why not go back to your safe space?
For all their digital ingenuity, Amazon sucks at correlating reviews to the correct Kindle versions of classic texts.  Many of the cheap (not free) classics, I suspect, are stolen from Project Gutenberg by dishonest individuals who add minimal value.  I'd go with an established publisher, if Amazon happens to have somehow listed the right edition under the right name.
Almost hoping some reporter uses a hand puppet to ask Spicer a question in a silly voice next time.
And here I thought "unfair" was a term used by clueless snowflakes.
New user, -100 karma already.  Congratulations!
Pence?  Ryan?  How far down the list do we need to go before we find someone sane?
There's a petition at wethepeople.gov with over 300k signatures.  Most signatures of any petition there.
You are a better person than I am.  If someone deliberately sets the house we both live in on fire, I'm gonna be pissed at them even if we both survive.
Nah, he'll slap a tariff on any imported bits.  Those "1"s made overseas are going to cost American companies 1.4 now.
Hulk love this guy?

Would love to see the Trump Organization get sued under RICO by a competitor business.  His not divesting before making policy seems to be the golden ticket for anyone looking to score some big bucks off of him.
The comments section in any online paper is full of nuts.  Even my county paper has loads of idiotic comments.  In the digital world, every single posted article has turned into an opinion forum.  With print you had a well-moderated "Letters to the Editor" section where the cranks were contained in one space.  Now you see craziness after every article.

Hey, it's as effective as prayer.
If this is how you feel now, call:\nNational Suicide Prevention Lifeline\n1-800-273-8255\nAvailable 24 hours everyday\n\nIf it's a longer term attitude, seek counseling or a different way of looking at what you see as the difficulties in your life.  Some people choose religion; I think Stoicism and Epicureanism have a lot to offer.  \n\nSurely you've had some good times; think back on them and realize that you would have missed the good times if you had exited the world before they came along.\n
Some (McCain, Graham, and a few House members near me) have opposed him on some key issues.  Many are indeed spineless wankers, but some R's still believe in a system of checks and balances.  We're going to need all the allies we can find to keep Trump away from the type of power he seeks.
Never thought of that, but it would have been hilarious.\n\nSeriously, the Saudis have been buying land in America for industrial farming because they used up all their water back home.

It'll be sent as a voucher to his 2020 reelection fund.
Damn interesting.  Who is #UnholyTrinity?\n\n(Edit: Found out it's apparently Priebus/Pence/Ryan.)
They'll fit right in!
Yeah, I don't have enough hands to carry my Starbucks frappucino, my crowbar, my abortion tools, and my framed picture of George Soros to all these protests at the same time!
"Maybe!"
Those aren't the only two groups in the world.
But it strengthens the argument that the Trump administration is illegitimate the more he breaks traditional American political norms.  One man is not our government.
Just subscribed to WaPo this week (free for six months with Amazon Prime!).
They bother to man their registers, unlike the second-best grocery store around me.  And their prices are good...they just don't sell crap quality stuff like the other groceries do.
*Yuuuuuuuge* people!
I wonder how long Tillerson's going to last under these conditions.  I wonder what he's thinking, since he is arguably more successful in business and has better leadership skills than Trump.  Why would he work for this guy?
They've gotta be shaking their heads when he brings that up.  "Less" and "more" is something an average preschooler understands, yet Trump reminds world leaders he can't figure it out when he brings up his inauguration.  And he has the nuclear launch codes.
It is a sad day in America when those 94 million babies, octogenarians, and stay-at-home moms can't find a job.
Dat 80s pink.\n\nI know of him only because my high school marching band director arranged "Boogie Down" (I think it was from this same album) for our show my sophomore year.  Love that song!  The world lost a very happy, talented man.
Coward.
This is what growing up rich will do to your brain.
Saw the "Yorktown" bit on the Tonys and thought it was unique, but still didn't get it.\n\nAfter the Schuyler sisters sang at the Superbowl pre-game, I finally checked out the cast album.  Now I get it!  Wow.
Nixon did do some good, but his undermining the republic is why he's a villain today.  Trump is much worse in that respect.  Hopefully America will be "unpresidented" before too much irreparable damage occurs.
As tightly as Orthodox religions are integrated with their national identity (Greek, Russian, etc.), I wouldn't be surprised if they keep it to themselves, since leaving the religion might be perceived as abandoning one's culture.\n\nI love a good Greek Festival, though, and I like seeing what the Orthodox churches look like.
We don't have the votes, nah nah nah nah, nah.
Hey, you should move to Michele Bachmann's old district!  Apparently they need you there.  Badly!
"liberate".\n\nIf coal were that great as an energy or raw material source, the big energy companies (ExxonMobil, BP, etc.) would be all over it.
Even adulting would be welcome.
Twist: Its antennae are for transmitting, not receiving.\nAnd [a certain video](http://www.news.com.au/lifestyle/real-life/news-life/twitter-is-drowning-in-a-goldenshower/news-story/17f297c7c86510cf986011201ab88d85) is on board the ship, ready for broadcast at a moment's notice....
I am convinced that the only reason they have an "Analytical" section on the GRE is to be sure you can pull your committee together at the end of your program on a certain date at a certain time in a certain room with the requisite number of committee members and dissertation readers.
I don't like sand.  It's coarse and rough and irritating and it gets everywhere.\n\n
I didn't know Japan had that style of fort.  Cool!
But the regulations are so lax!
Trump's order makes for good TV.  He's an reality TV entertainer, not a statesman.  Logic doesn't fly with him.
It was a Senator from Oklahoma, for anyone looking for a tl;dr.
The best place for a nut.
We're ALL going to have PTSD on this blessed day.
He will be made to understand soon enough that not properly divesting himself of his business interests ahead of taking office will be an economic liability for himself and his kids, who are now supposedly handling The Trump Organization.  Tying up the phone lines of the hotels so guests can't get through to make reservations is a good first step in sending that message.
It's almost as if being a spoiled rich brat who never had to grow up or work for his wealth is poor preparation for the most important job in the world.
Classy and appropriate.  /s
I read it as "Escorts"...
RCP?  Pass.
Dissent is not treason.  Treason is conspiring with a foreign agent hostile to the country's interest.  Like Trump has done.
This is the lawmaker who wants to introduce affirmative action for conservative professors applying to faculty positions at Iowa universities.
I would be curious to see what proportion of the unemployed refuse to relocate for a new job.  I mean, yeah, the Rust Belt has lost a lot of jobs, but you can move out of an economically depressed region.
Yeah, the IRS never really enforced it like they could or should have. But I doubt "destroying" it will make much difference ultimately, since churchgoers tend to congregate with like-minded people anyway. Hopefully some people will leave the churches that get heavy-handed with the politics.\n\nAlso, this will give Muslims, the Satanic Temple, Discordians, the Church of the FSM, the Church of the SubGenius, etc. a textbook test case on the First Amendment.\n\n
Of course he would.  \n\nThe libertarian line we heard in my high school civics class was, "Public schools are like public restrooms."
I am not blowing away my (beat) snot
I seem to donate every time a Republican President is elected.  Wish I didn't have to, but here we are.
Yes.  They randomly disappear, apparently whenever I want to cast to one of them and then I can't even see them in the Google Home app.  Also, from time to time my three CC Audios will take over my router and knock my other wifi devices off my network.  Rebooting the router (I'm on Verizon FiOS) seems to clear it up.  \n\nAlso, I use mostly Spotify, and I don't think I can easily cast from my Chromebook in the Spotify app.  If I'm running a Chromebook, I should be able to access any Chrome___ device from any Chromebook app (but that's probably a Spotify issue, not a Google issue).\n\nThe CC audio was cheap, though, for what it is.
Good to see this.  I figured the transcripts were long gone and there was no way to verify his claim.  \n\nLying about academic achievement is pathetic, as is constantly having to tell everyone how smart you are.
"Wooden area"?  \n\nMore like "wooded area".  \n\nUnless someone's trying to say "Woody's" in a roundabout way.
Waiting for "Mexico allows deployment of Russian missiles" headline.  It's generally not a good idea for a nation to piss off its next-door neighbor.
Until 2020 when they pull the same garbage against anyone who dares to run against Bernie.\n\nAppeasement doesn't work.
Keith Ellison will bring Bernie supporters back into the party if he is elected.
No he won't. They'll find some other reason to not join the party. Even on the multitude of Bernie subreddits are talk of how the DNC still needs to do more like primary not pure enough Democrats and offer a formal apology to Bernie and have all open caucuses 
Are you saying ego is more important than issues and Bernie supporters will destroy everything if they don't get their way?
We'll be lucky to make the tournament next year.
Of course Bernie and his crew were threatening people into voting for Ellison. Because obviously people respond so well to threats. I wonder how Ellison could have done without their "help".\n\nhttp://www.politico.com/story/2017/02/sanders-revolution-resists-dnc-loss-235404
He does that without the chants.
Sam Hinkie was done so dirty by the 76ers, damn.
And when you expect a Democrat from Missouri to be the same as a Democrat from Connecticut or Washington then you'll be looking at perpetual minorities in both houses.\n\nThe Dems nearly had a supermajority in 2009 because the party was diverse and a big tent.\n\nDogmatic progressivism everywhere is not how we're going to come back.
Wtf
If it actually works, which isn't a guarantee, it would hand the GOP another Senate seat without them having to put any resources into it.\n\nIt's objectively a stupid idea.
Watch that shit happen.
Let's not assume. I think Ellison gets it on the second ballot.
They are so dumb.
Kings front office is like the Trump administration of the NBA.
BASKETBALL REASONS PLEASE!!!
Yep. I like Ellison but if he loses Bernie and his supporters need to look in the mirror because they'll have been a big reason why.
Yikes, okay.\n\nI want Perez to win just for the record.
A lot of stupid people on the left were the loudest on that particular train.\n\n
There will be reading. The only book you'll be allowed to read is the Bible though.
What, did Ted Thompson himself write this?
The people who run the Bucks are dumb too, but they aren't that dumb.
His ceiling is probably Nina Turner who's opinion people care about even less if it's possible.
Isola said we were getting Dame, so probably him.
They like her because she endorsed Bernie and attacked the DNC. Literally the only reason why.
The next Jason Kidd.......
Actually Ellison is the one who's going to get it through shitty backroom politicking.\n\nBut I bet the far left thinks it's okay when he does it.
The Ray Allen trade........
Fox News is state media. Think about that.....
They are trying the hardest.
Every reporter is just dumping all their Boogie intel before this all goes down.
They just got a new arena so no.
God the people who run the Kings are dumb.\n\nBet they think the Earth is flat too.
Jennings Bomb???
She's not a Democrat.
Well he is an Armenian Genocide denier so....
Hoo boy, if Michelle Obama had done this the GOP outrage machine would have gone insane.\n\nRemember the tan suit???
The Kings front office is the Trump administration of the NBA.
Dean just endorsed Ellison. I think it's over.\n\nSo are we allowed to say we're going to quit unless Ellison does what we want now?
Then when they lose they'll call everything rigged and rag on some imaginary establishment and we'll repeat the cycle all over again.
Get that homophobic shit out of here man. Everybody knows what you're trying to say.
I think folks are starting to see the writing on the wall.\n\nGood for Perez though. Ellison ought to look at some of the supporters he had in this race and think about if they really helped him or just hurt him. \n\nI think they hurt him.
But they'll take Buddy and two mid first picks......
John Kasich talks a good game now, but let's not pretend he wouldn't sign a full ACA repeal put forward by the House if he were president right now.
And it's coinciding with Weaver and Bernie going on TV to trash Perez and threaten the DNC if he wins.\n\nThey're getting desperate.
Makes you wonder what Jeanie had to do to get all this goodwill from the media.\n\nHow many glowing Jeanie Buss features is this now? Who knew canning your own family could be so lucrative as far as good press goes.
Perez always has his analogies on point.
We've got one good player and we're still above the cap but somehow everything is Kidd's fault?
Came here to say this.\n\nHe's garbage.
Get this man that MVP trophy.
He's literally a walking charicature of why people dislike politicians.\n\nHe fits every terrible stereotype there is.
If my own sister fired me and cut me out of the multi billion dollar business that my Dad left to both of us and I get massacred in the press while she gets nothing but glowing praise I know I wouldn't want to go quietly into the night either.\n\nJerry Buss giving one of his kids more power than the others was a terrible idea.
That'd be some petty shit.
When can we stop talking about Bernie Sanders every ten seconds?\n\nLast time I checked he isn't on stage at this pointless thing.
Bernie was using Ellison to promote himself. He wants one of his guys in there for when he runs in 2020.
I'd be cool with that.
As if lying to the player and trading him for peanuts wasn't bad enough, let's get our play by play guy, who we pay, to trash him on his way out the door.\n\nGood plan.
The parties are so fundamentally different these days that you have to be a special kind of stupid to be an undecided voter.
And I'm sure Neera tuned in to TYT Live to see it.
Even though he said he wouldn't.
The reports aren't taking into account how stupid the people who run the Kings are.
I'm just waiting for the snarky Hillary Clinton tweet.
That's what I thought. I think that's more likely.
It doesn't help that we haven't seen the East's best players since the third quarter.
Paid for by money that they had to borrow.
Because Magic likes Corey Brewer.
You're exactly right. They need to learn how to lose or they'll never win.
Yeah, and that culture is a blend of ineptitude and lying to players and agents.
With how trash we are I'm still absolutely amazed that we're above the cap.\n\n
Hoo man, Nina Turner is running for Ohio Governor. That ought to go well.\n\nI hope she wins the primary so that when she gets blown out by Kasich she can't blame Democrats.
How does she get to decide to fire him? Doesn't he own as much of the team as she does?
Well yeah.
Looks like Ellison is going to win.\n\nThe blackmail worked I guess.
You have to ask yourself why a guy with this much talent keeps getting cut by teams.
Well their eyes need glasses.
The DNC needs money to operate.
Only if Vlade and Vivek are next.
This is my big takeaway of this whole thing,\n\nJeanie hires her long-time friend Magic as a consultant who then instantly starts making a power play for her own brother's job.\n\nThen she fired her own family who also happens to literally own the team.\n\nAnd she fires a good GM and hires Magic who has no front office or player personnel experience at all to take over the whole team.\n\nJeanie sure has some allies in the media that's for sure. This whole thing seems mad shady to me, as well as being dubious in its intelligence, and she's still not getting criticized.
If you live in the rural Midwest and have racist beliefs you're a racist.\n\nIf you don't then nobody is talking about you.
Yo, you guys want Monroe or Henson???
Tobias Harris for a half season of JJ Reddick was bad too.
We're the Bucks. I can't make any promises.
It's not just because they buy weapons from us.
Tom Perez isn't a moderate.
This guy is literally being paid to say this.
It's excruciatingly clear most of them have no idea what the DNC chair does.
Care to provide any examples?
The team crumbles without Happ in and he can't play every minute.
Hopefully our recruiting class is good or we're going to be hot garbage next year.
Exactly right.\n\nI like Ellison personally, it's some of his supporters who drive me up a wall. He doesn't deserve to lose this race because his supporters are hurting him.
I am kidding.\n\nShe's not going to win the primary anyway.
Yikes!!!\n\n\nhttps://twitter.com/GregJKrieg/status/835584212988219392
Jeanie Buss sure does have some allies in the media.
Can the NBA just seize this team and fire everyone???
He's been like this for a long time. It's not you.
And certain segments of the left.
Yeah, wtf. And who's decision was that? I'd be upset if I were him.
Then where did the earlier story come from?
This East lineup is trash.
No
I must be dead. We're talking Bucks at an All Star Game.
Perez isn't really a centrist Democrat though. It's like nobody even looks at his record.
Interesting approach but I think we should stick with the privacy rights issue which supports 'Her body, her choice'.
No fly list is the potential punishment.
After you've boarded the plane? Highly unusual 
Sorry, I missed that the checks were done post boarding. This is entirely unnecessary. I agree with you 100%, flying is stressful enough and I'd rather take some risks than live miserable and humiliated.
Its normal to check when boarding, but after you have already boarded too!? Flying is stressful enough as it is, now we have to look at federal agents going through our flight, and wondering if everything is okay, or if maybe our flight has a potential terrorist on board!!!!!
I have never boarded a plane without showing some ID. is that unusual or undesirable to check IDs for plane  flights? sounds reasonable to me.
Get Barack, Michelle, Bernie, Warren, Biden, etc out holding rallies to encourage local participation and excitement.  This will strengthen the local base and get them to work downballot.  These rallies can visit every Congressional District in 2018 for a relatively inexpensive cost.  
Deport more immigrants than the system can handle, cracked down on jail filling victim less crimes, encourage private prisons.  \nDon't forget to have ownership or kickbacks from those prisons before hand...
In an alternate Universie,\n\n"Justice Department reaffirms it's commitment to ending the use of private prisons. In a statement, President Clinton said..."
As someone who is center right, (and more right than center) I understand the appeal to private prisons. Heck, at a county level, I *might* be in favor of it. It's the kind of thing that would have to be decided via ballot not policy,. \n\nHowever,  at the same time, I think that private prisons on the federal level are a dangerous abandonment of one of the few things that I think government has a moral duty to execute (pun unintended). 
Should have taken the username Motivader. 
Starla? Wasn't she a buisness model for the Bluth company?
Because he's the President. \n\nI can't believe someone needs to explain the idea of taking responsibility for the actions of others under your authority on this subreddit. 
Your definition of honesty makes me never want to buy a car or appliance from you. 
Nope, it really happened. It's in the episode where Tuvok is trying to train up/haze some of the Maquis crew members to Starfleet standards. \n\nThen when one of them talks to Chakotay about it, dude gets decked. 
And the nice thing is that it will be nowhere near as difficult getting back to the ground! 
You skipped all the civics and American government class in school didn't you? \n\nIt would explain a lot. 
Make left traffic... By turning right. 
Same here. I basically kind of had to grit my teeth and get through until he left earth in the beginning. \n\nAfter that, everything was pretty good. 
Not for the good of the many, for the Prime Directive! And when you put it that way it sounds a lot less utilitarian and cold. 
No you didn't. You didn't need to post this. 
You know what, forget the new empire! 
Oh deer. 
Five five six. 
YOU'RE REPLYING TO A DISTRO! STOP REPLYING!

And then later Honda. 
How'd you feel about taking up a student pilot (or hopefully PPL before the end of March) willing to pay pro rata at some point before the end of the year? 
Okay, so cooking isn't hard. It can potentially seem kind of daunting, admittedly but it's not impossible. Baking however, is just witchcraft and makes no sense to me. \n\nOne super easy thing to do would be grabbing a pizza from Papa Murphys. I'd recommend the chicken garlic, it's delicious. Just follow the directions on the wrapper and within 15 minutes you've got delicious pizza. \n\n Or another slightly more complicated, but still suuuuper simple meal could be grilled chicken. \n\nFirst, get a couple of chicken breast, do a butterfly cut, and then marinate them in Italian dressing overnight. Then the next day toss them on a greased pan and add some garlic pepper, and if you like spicy, a bit of cayenne powder. The chicken is done when it's white all the way thorough. \n\nThen get some instant mashed potatoes and your choice of veggies (I like either green beans) those both would take about 10 minutes at the most.  Start those once you've got the chicken on the grill, and they should all be done around the same time. 
How about Jack trying to write Sam's OPR, with both Daniel and Teal'c offering to help, but only making it worse. Extra hijinks occur if it can't have any SGC things related and only be related to her official job. \n\nThen it ends with Walter writing the thing perfectly on one try, because of Chief witchcraft.
Considering it is Dukat, probably a bunch of Bajoran slave women, and the rest of the staff are half-Cardassian half Bajorans who almost look like Dukat. 
I want a short story from the POV of a baker who had Eldest Gruff come and order the doughnut. 
>And how can we eat if she's not cooking? I don't need fancy feast every night but we have to eat food\n\nIs there a reason you can't cook? 
The Captain should have ran the memo up to the CSS. \n\nThe commander's secretary is always a terrifyingly competent spell check incarnate. 
Apparently versebot hates the Message too. 
Hopefully they get an A&P there to check the weight and balance. 
It had such an interesting concept too. I really liked the idea of interstellar national interests instead of a united Earth. \n\nHe seems like a pretty nice guy, with good world building ideas. He just needs to put  more effort into honing his writing instead of pushing out dozens of books and series. 
I wager 500 quatloos that you're just making up that exchange rate. 
Hey idiot. You hit reply all. 
I thought it was absolutely brilliant satire on poorly written pulp fiction. \n\nI loved being told 15 or 20 times that the Ark Royal is the only choice because of its solid state armor! \n\nAlso, I loved the way that characters constantly complained about politicians, reporters, and civilians in general. \n\nAlso, the awkward sex scenes between the CAG and Rose were fantastic. \n\nAnd who can forget the way it was constantly mentioned that one of the reporters was *inhumanly* thin, or the component officer requested assignment to the worst ship ever. IS THERE THE POSSIBILITY OF ALIEN INFLUENCE THERE? Hell no! \n\nFull disclosure: I've read books 1 through 6 and one of his other books (Barbrians at the Gate),  and at this point I feel like an abused spouse thinking that if I read another book of his if may be different. 
How about instead of trying to make the Democrats look bad, we make ourselves look good through making sure our politicians have a record of public service and character. 
>As long as people don't treat it the same as actual scripture. Treat it like a commentary.\n\nThe problem is that people marketed it as a Bible, and people have used it as such. 
Steam. 
He went back to his home planet. 
Probably because there was barely any dialog in Star Trek 1.
They really blew it. 
Aren't we all though? 
Do you want to qualify?
I'M GAY DADDY! I'M GAY! MRS SIMPSON MADE ME GAY! 
I like that fact. 
Not quite the same thing, but if I remember right, there was a CCT (maybe a TACP?) who got commissioned and became an A10 driver. \n\nIn my head canon, that's how I decided O'Neil's career path went.
I should have been clear. I would have voted for that ticket in opposition to Trump.\n\nTrump and his partisans are a sickness that has infected the Republican party,  and I'd rather have a moderate Democrat like Webb than an authoritarian like Trump. 
>I hear they have a french captain and a fucking robot.\n\nOnly in the second episode. 
And that movie needs all the help it can get. 
It'll never work. 
That'd be the kind of question I'd get wrong. \n\nNot because I think Huck is black, but because it's too obvious and I'd psych myself out. 
Personally, I love it when people try to relate to me by saying they *almost* joined the military. 
Or the ruler he is using. 
The only two hardened buildings on my FOB were the TOC and the men's latrine. 
I just can't believe the lengths Picard would go through to get with Crusher. 
I care about Russia's opinion about this about as much as my dad cared about the Soviet's opinion in the late 80s. 
I think that is exactly what he is doing. 
Well, he plays a clone of Picard, not a young Picard. 
I wonder if it says anything! 
I'm like ...99% sure that's a joke by a veteran. \n\nAt least that's how I saw it, when I chuckled as I scrolled past it.
That was good, but my favorite was when we played the 9ers on Thanksgiving and beat them 19-3. \n\nNowhere near as good as 58-0, but Sherman and Wilson eating turkey on the 50 yard line in San Francisco was fantastic.
Please tell me you know that from Tim Hawkins. 
Unintentional realism is the best kind of realism! 
May it be better than 🇪🇬🇬🇭
I thought about joining the Legion, but I would have just yelled back when the Centurion yelled at me in basic. 
I understand the idea, but also it seems to have gone from attempting to make sure Republican voices aren't downvoted into oblivion, but it seems to have moved past that into attempting to silence dissent. 
>***Rendezvous with Rama*** By Arthur C. Clarke (annoyingly they only have the first book)\n\nNo, that's a benefit. \n\nHow was the Jumper series btw? 
I'M GOING TO TRIAL BECAUSE YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND A BLOOPER REEL?! 
Is it common to do your cross country before you solo? \n\nI'm at a 141 school, but doing my PPL under part 61.

That's called a classic. 
I didn't. \n\nI've been out since 2013 though  
My favorite part of that was the clock in the background. 
Hallowed are the Ori. 
Also, I was banned for a year for violating rule one after posting this thread. Interesting. \n\n

I didn't hate the Indian Bond idea, but from there on it kept getting worse and worse, so I gave up around the Rock. If I kept going, I was afraid of getting cancer. 
I wish I would have noticed that before I just cast my cooking pearls before the swine. 
In addition, I'd recommend having a second kid as soon as possible so he won't get lonely in the sound proofed room.

I am so triggered that I am filing multiple suits with one triggering. 
Observation: I think you are a meatbag merely pretending to be a robot. 
Dry observation: Gee master, I hope nothing happens to you when I'm sitting on the Ebon Hawk. 
I love that picture so much. 
The Shatnerverse comment annoys me. \n\nThe reason that the Shatnerverse isn't recognized in the current TrekLit is because it predates them. By pretty close to half a decade at least. \n\nUnlike other trek books that came out at the time, it's a self contained universe rather than stand alone like the numbered novels. If anything, I'd almost view it as the precursor to the current TrekLit. \n\nNow we can talk about quality, but they were entertaining and engaging stories that teenage me enjoyed. 
Who? 
Suddenly everyone who complained about stop loss realizes they didn't have it so bad. 
I'd imagine they get the normal $3.50 deployment per diem.\n\nAlso, I'd love to see an episode where Jack had to fill out a travel voucher. \n\nOr have it revealed that Baal made DTS.

Comrade, you are being too obvious with your pro-Russia agenda. Tone it down if you want to remain a somewhat effective ~~shill~~ poster. 
I don't know that guy from Adam. However, based on that one post I want his life to be one of unending woe and misery. 
>B-52's are no longer based all around. They are in North Dakota and Louisiana.\n\nAnd Guam!
I hope/think that a good chunk of that percentage of people who voted for Trump were more voting against Hillary. 
Only if you're a student pilot. 
Which is saying something too, because the episodes were pretty good as well. 
YOU LEAVE INKFIDEL ALONE!

First step, apply for a job with NASA.\n\nIf you have a pending astronaut application (also works with any other job, but apply for astronaut. It sounds cool), and they can't take your certificate away since NASA has the certificate and the FAA has fewer letters than NASA. \n\nBy the time they're done processing and rejecting your application the FAA will have forgotten about it because one of idiots on r/drones will have crashed a drone into an airplane. 
IT'S A FAAAAKE. 
I see you've played knifey spoony before. 
Isn't this better than Hillary?
It fattens their wallets. 
Trump really drained that swamp didn't he?  \n  \nLoving these politicians who put normal americans before corporations.  \n  \nSo much respect for our reps.  Great people.  
What good does this do?
I honestly think the lack of reporting on the CFPB and Jeb Hensarling's nonsense is the saddest part of this whole month.\n\nIt's a shame that I see 3-4 stories a day on Milo or some other low-hanging fruit that we can poke fun at. The CFPB really helps people and it seems like it's just complicated enough to confuse centrists into thinking it's useless.\n\nHensarling is a genuine piece of garbage, and his name remains totally unknown. Alex Jones, on the other hand, is crazy and has been sensationalized for it.
It makes rich people even more richer.
Right!? Sigh.
That was her profile pictures
even a mid tier offense would be killer
"Capt. Robert Melton was still inside his vehicle when he was shot. He had just pulled up next to a vehicle and suspect that matched the description of an earlier drive-by shooting." \n\nI know you want to think that all police officers are dirty scumbags but the majority of them are not.

Yeah I can see that but I think these maps over state the side of the Federation
Any Star Trek show is going to have a problem reeling in a new audience. People who have never seen the show and have just seen the new movies are not going to understand that this is a different timeline. TNG had throwbacks to TOS but they did not dominate the show. A new show set in a post VOY/Nemesis era can lightly refer to old shows in a passing reference like the way the TNG movies referred to the Dominion. I have all the faith in the world that the DSC staff will make the show great but if they think they are going to get viewers but targeting a general audience rather than the actual fans, they are mistaken. 
I'm also in this league and we are very active at this point we're pretty much fictional but it's really worth it.
Psd16 has openings, i can send you an invite to our slack channel if you give me your email address
I think you're missing the point,I'm not supporting Trump at all. All I'm saying is that a joke with use that as a last name is kind of stupid now and it wasn't even that funny to begin with.
do you happen to have the model #?\n
Still for sale?

You can find pedo symbols anywhere if you look hard enough. Its not like they are complex design's.
Id rather have protections instead of regulations
Is online league features going to be updated that area seems to be somewhat lacking could you shed some light on this?
I'd like a key because I am very poor
My point is that a name could ruin so much.
Not only that but they probably have what appears to be candy bars floating also
Shitty candidate yes, but there are fake news sites that most people i work with, followed. They all voted for Trump and would believe anything because they hated her so much.
As a liberal, even i find this statement batshit crazy.
It's still a thing, probably not as big, but it's still a thing.
Listen I know plenty of gay people and last people they want to marry them as somebody that is going to judge them.
that is more than i would want to spend
As a liberal i know i take my talking points and ideas from this site. The fact that you post it like it is even a relevant site is laughable. 
Drop the Drumpf, it was funny for a week.
i am intrested but i just need the model # and maybe a pic or two\n\n
 I think most people forget that. It also could be  that they're just not educated enough to understand the American political system
Why not. Destabilize the region and your long time enemy and roll right in. 
It's going to take a while, they are really huuuuggggeeee
That picture was when the speech started 
When it is not a popular phone, no one cares. When it is an iPhone people fees it will cause a trend. I get why apple wants this though. They probably feel the mass will adopt Bluetooth headphones and not look back.
I married her
I guess.
that sucks

I would say once a week. I work at a prison and the warden makes his rounds once a week to each department, so since both rolls are somewhat similar, I would say once a week.
Even though i am a liberal, this is still hilarious
For a paid service, mostly hardcore fans will want to subscribe. Basic run of the mill fans will not. \n\n\n> It just means that they will have a easier time balancing continuity dumps with a show that is based in a era of Trek well less prior continuity to work from.\n\nContinuity works both ways for this show. Not only can they not violate past events, they cannot create big baddies that have never been mentioned in the future. A show set in the future can briefly mention prior events but they do not have to focus on it
Maybe all of the god like creatures manipulated holograms and their tech was not as advanced as it seemed
Real problem is that, if this is classified information, he just leaked it. 
They hate him
can i get some pictures
Who said it was a joke?
I am not against a prequel as long as it connects with what we know. How hard would it have been to just do "another" 5 year mission set after Voyager to explore more of the alpha or beta quadrant. This way they do not have to worry about bringing back old characters and they can reference the past shows in passing. 
So majestic
One is a comedian and the other is a free speech advocate, it is a difference. 
My only problem with these maps is how it could be possible to for the Klingons invade Cardassian space without the Feds stopping them.
Jesus Christ, we have a long way to go. Freaking out about this seems pointless this early. 
Ain't that some shit 
They are not against it but they are doing what the Republicans did years ago.

What could the motive possibly be to justify shooting police officer like that?
I honestly think there was tons of abuse that isnt spoken of but just alluded to. Although she is becoming no different.\n\n
Well  russia didn't do so well against Afghani Rebels
For a sec I thought that was Axl Rose 
What kills me is that all they need to do is improve the law and they would be praised. Since it is called Obamacare, they have to get rid of it.
I am sure a good number of business owners do the same.
I think they had issues partly due to the amount of episodes they had to fill.
Or you could just forget about the Borg and and find another new Big bad
I doubt a wall would stop this guy
This would be terrible for Republicans he would have to fall out of favor by all the people that voted for Trump because there would be rioting in the streets.

"The bill aims to prevent the federal government from taking action against people who discriminate against LGBTQ people for religious reasons."\n\nNot really something the left wants...\n\n
Why is it that they do not want to confirm to norms but I Have to confirm to their way out thinking? I don't care what people do what they want to be called but I shouldn't have to conform
As a guy, it wouldnt matter much to me. Listen if he has a problem with it, he prob is not a guy you need to keep around. 
Good, even though Trump used her like a prop. His comments were out of line.

I'm sorry about the argument is invalid. A simple search on Memory Alpha could be used I mean Simon Pegg did it.
I think you spelled "loser" wrong.  
I'm guessing that's some clinton digg.  I'm not a fan of hers either, so slam all you want.  \n\nAny politician that treats america like their piggy bank, breaks the law, ignores democracy, and/or lies, needs to be removed from office and jailed in my opinion.  Regardless of party.    \n  \n
It was pretty simple.  "Did you have knowledge of anyone associated with the Trump campaign meeting with any Russian officials?"  \n  \nNot only did he volunteer that he was himself a member of the Trump campaign, but that he never met with any Russians.  \n  \nHow is that not perjury?  \n  \n
In the same way that reporter who was armed with facts did.  \n  \nYou confront him with actual numbers or documented facts.  He needs to be stopped on the spot when he spouts BS, and made to explain what he's talking about and specifically where he's getting his information.  Remember how much he likes sources?  Well let's see him produce some.    \n  \n
They are already trying to deflect by using context as an alibi, it's bullshit.  He was asked if he had contact, he said he did not have contact with russians under oath.  That was a lie.  \n  \nREMOVE THIS TRAITOR FROM OFFICE NOW!!!
So a group of people got together to make a car that can't be driven.  Okay.  
How do you find out how your rep voted? 
It was on /r/all.  Saw the title.  Commented.  \n
It does if you make it.  
Did you see the video of Franken asking him in plain English about meeting with Russians?    \n  \nIf so, there is the evidence.  He lied about 2 meetings.    \n  \nWhat more do you need?
I'm not going to watch this so can someone give me a play by play of who Ice is, where he is, what he's doing, and what happens?    \n  \nAs far as I can tell, he just witnessed a suicide.  I don't do any gore, so I'm not watching, but apparently I made the mistake of going this far and now need to know what happened.  
Oh my god, that sounds like so much fun.  I'm in NY and we don't have anything like this in my area :(  \n  \n  
Who the fuck is talking about Hillary?  Are you going to bring up bengazi?  \n  \nHe was asked if he met with Russians and said no.  If that's not perjury, than you're living in a glorious little bubble.  
What about simple bartering?  We get rid of the money and the value of the dollar and just trade things.    \n  \nI feel like that would still evolve into capitalism.  Dammit.  \n\n
Never let him get away with lies.  This fool needs to be taken to task whenever he spouts his BS, and his lies need to be exposed on the spot for what they are.  \n  \n
He is digging such a hole.  I love it.  
Let me make a few guesses:  \n  \nYou've never been out of the US.  \n  \nYou don't know any people from other countries.  \n  \nYou don't read.  \n    \n  \nHow is the security here bad?  Granted trump is praying we get attacked, that much is obvious.  And who the fuck said anything about obama?  I have to love obama because I think trump is a loud mouthed moron who may or may not have russian ties?  Seems like a man who demanded to see obama's documents could at least produce his own, hmmm?  No?  How exactly is it going to matter how well any business does if the entire world thinks we are fools and our rivers are catching on fire because your boy donny wants to make america polluted again for a few extra bucks in his rich buddy's pockets.  You're either a class a idiot, or one of the many paid trolls that he needs to make it seem like he has support.  \n  \nRock on with that cool guy.  Or should I say comrade?    \n  \nAt the end of the day, I'll at least be supporting a thoughtful, intelligent person, who conducts him or herself with class and a sense of respect for people.  You'll never be able to say that about the monster you have chosen to support.    \n  \nDo you seriously not wince when he says things are huge, stupendous, terrific, the best, and all the other words designed to win over fools with absolutely no substance behind them?  Are you actually fooled by that?  Do you watch him say horrible things about people and say "that's my guy"?  And what do you do when you see that he's clearly lying?  Or do you believe his revised facts, like he won with the biggest electoral vote count since reagan?  Or that he had an even bigger crowd at his inaugural than obama...  The fact that he has spent a month bragging about it and that it was actually not true didn't turn you off?  Seriously?  Who the fuck are you if you're actually still on board with this lunatic?  Are you that loyal to a reality show host billionaire who doesn't give a fuck about you and lies like he breathes?  I would love it if trump delivered on his jobs promises, and would gladly give him credit, but his personality is toxic.  If you can't admit that, than you're some kind something.  \n  \n\n  \n
Wait, let me mention it for you.... bengazi, right?  \n  \nOr was it hillary's emails.  Whatever makes you dismiss that you're supporting traitors to russia.    \n  \nRock on comrade.  \n  \n
Wow.  I saw that on /r/the_donald yesterday.  Is he visiting that sub.  \n  \nWhen I saw that I just facepalmed and thought it was stupid because Schumer is meeting with Putin in public.  It's an open meeting.  Not a hidden thing like trump and all his cronies are guilty of.  There is no analogue between the two situations.  It's just dumb, but the people who support trump will eat that up.  I hope Schumer fucking nails him on it and how dumb of a comparison it is, while driving the point home that he at least can do it without lying.   
The guitars are in that rack backwards.  The tuning keys should be facing outward. 
The dems just need to remind them of how they reacted in similar instances, while hammering the shit out of them.  \n  \nHere's hoping the hammering happens.

They keep moving the football.  
More of the same.  Great.    \n  \nLet's do this all again in 8 years.  \n  \nWash, rinse, repeat.  \n  \nFuck sake. 
Thanks for this.  \n  \nWhat system of exchanging goods still allows for personal consumptive freedom and works better than capitalism?  The best I can think of is maybe some type of hybrid capitalism/socialism, which I guess is what we have now.  \n  \nI'm admittedly not up to speed on the finer points of any of the economic systems, but capitalism seems to have growth as a central focus above and beyond remaining sustainable or even existing.  I'm always confused as to why the economy must keep growing, or why large corporations must keep growing.  Is there any point at which they can decide to just remain constant and instead of growing, just bank the cash?  It seems like the end goal is always over-saturation, crash, rebuild, and do it all again if possible.      
This right here. 
Mix desperate and arrogant with a heavy dash of stupid, and we've got a recipe for more of this grasping at straws behavior.  
Well the alarm clock sound made me want to punch something.  Not sure how the rest is, because fuck anything with that annoying sound.  \n  \n

This right here.  If I've learned anything about this country's very strange presidential selection habits, it's that they (well many) do not elect based on qualifications.  They want a fucking entertainer or a famous person.  \n  \nReagan, Jesse the Body, Arnold.  \n  \nIf George Clooney woke up and said he wanted to run, guess who the next president would be?   
Sooo.....  how is that legal?  Isn't that at least slander or defamation of character?  \n  \n
Yep.  That bullshit model of car sales needs to die now.  Yesterday even.  \n  \nThe fact that some douche in a cheap shirt and tie is working their hardest to get me to pay more for one of the most expensive purchases out there, is utter bullshit.    \n  \nHere's hoping Tesla can set some precedent for getting factory direct sales.  I can't wait for dealers to pack their bullshit up and get the fuck out of my car sale.  
This is so embarrassing.  Truly embarrassing.  Sorry world, but this is what half the american people wanted.  Fuck sake.   
People like this never quit.  He's on a once in a lifetime, dream-level, power trip.  This is a narcissist dream.  Endless attention and power.  \n  \nImpeachment, however unlikely, would probably not be enough to oust this shit bag.    
SpazzFuck.    \n  \nI wonder what the girls who do scenes with him think?    \n  \nIt's all just hyper intense, weird position, overly aggressive stuff.  I saw this dude in a porn a few years ago, before he became this popular, and was just creeped out by him.  When I find a video of a hot girl and it ends up being him that's with her, I'm usually a bum out, as I know the girl is about to get destroyed for the next several minutes at one speed...  Spazz.  \n  \n \n  \n
I like this.  Thanks

We don't.  It's to pacify a large voter base in economically depressed areas that need to transition to new industries, but don't want to because of the good ole days.  Those days are not coming back and they need to realize that.  
This is awesome.  Where is this?  I'd love to race with you guys.
How does that work?  Do you and your parents have a relationship that doesn't allow you to talk to them in a way that calls into question what they believe (if done in a polite way)?  Or even to bust on them a bit?  If my parents were into donny, I would give them endless shit in a playful way, and present them evidence about certain lies.  They could give their side of the story and we'd reason about which version of events is more likely.  Hopefully in a civil way, but in a way where they were called into question somehow.  Ugg.  Just typing that is depressing.  Then they might think of you as the kid who has turned on them and been brainwashed by the evil left.  Geez.  Who knows.  But say something.  \n  \nGood luck.
Socialism has such a stigma attached to it here in the states that you could never call it by that name.  The conservatives have branded it in a way that has it on a similar level to satanism.    \n  \nAre there any economies out there today that are pure socialism?
Are they forgetting the many times that boner cried?  That man cried all the time.  Like a little bitch.  \n  \n
I'm poor and live in the west.  Do I still need to feel guilty?
I've got a very similar setup with my guitars in the same sort of rack.  I haven't heard any audible sympathetic resonance, but I'm sure it's going on at some level.  Sounds like it's not such a bad thing that the piano is in the other room.  I'm guessing it would make some unwanted noises otherwise.  \n  \n
And coffee/caffeine.  Not sure why this one is left out of the discussion.  If you think caffeine is not a drug, try not drinking it for a day and take note of the blinding headache you get until you consume more.  \n  \n
A ton.  Just never on purpose.  
Since bush was "elected", my saying has been, "never underestimate the power of stupid".  It's served me well.  \n  \n
What?  Why the actual fuck is this failed politician and fraud, commenting on anything?  \n  \nCan't this piece of shit go away for good?
Pelosi is calling for just that.  
Why can't a band just sell them through their website?
Yeah, you can tell from the mother's enormous boob job that she has on display that they're a very classy bunch.  Very appropriate court room attire.    
It sounds like your life is about to get a lot better.  Hang in there until you get that bus. admin degree.  Seriously.  Not sure if you're thinking about going into schools, but I can tell you that people do quite well in schools as principals and eventually superintendents with those degrees.  Don't lose hope.  When you get out of your parents house and have a decent job it will all seem like a distant bad dream.    \n  \nGood luck
And what would those "other" issues be?  \n  \nWait, let me get that for you...  bengazi?  Hillary's emails?  Pizzagate?  Those ships have sailed and we are talking about something far more serious here.    \n  \nSay straw man all you want, but I'll happily be on the side without a pile of evidence that keeps screaming RUSSIA.    
Nope.  You need to operate with the frame of mind that there are forces powerful enough to keep him in there.  Telling yourself that he'll be gone soon will only serve to pacify you into a false sense of comfort.  Strap in and prepare to never underestimate the power of stupid.  It gave us 8 years of Bush and is about to give us 8 years of trump.  Work with that in mind, as it's a likely scenario no matter how bad things get.  Between the gerrymandering and the energized redneck/senior base, it's hard to vote these guys out right now.  Here's hoping that Obama makes some progress with this anti-gerrymandering initiative he's taking part in.    \n  \nIf you know anyone that's not registered to vote, talk to them.  I would love to get all the inner city people registered, but they'd have to be ready and willing to wait in some serious lines (the gerrymandering) on election day.    
SpazzFuck strikes again.  This man is prolific.  
Does this OP also write the click bait titles that the motley fool uses everywhere?  \n  \nI have lost all respect for that site at this point.

Spoiler alert:  YES.  He will.  
Geez.  Smart guy, but I'm not surprised that he could never find happiness.  He over-analyzes everything.  It's as if his brain won't let me just chill and enjoy life with all it's flaws.  \n  \n
Xbox to DVI/HDMI adapter.  Computer uses the VGA port on monitor.  Use source button on monitor to choose which one you want to use.  \n  \nI recently bought an inexpensive DVI/HDMI adapter on amazon.  Works great. 
What the actual fuck?  Do people watch this crap?  \n  \nMy blood pressure went up in the few minutes I spent watching that.  How on earth is that an intelligent conversation or even an interview?  That was just some guy yelling over another guy as soon as he tried to answer a question.  Is this what "news" is like these days?  \n  \nFuck sake.  I am glad that I don't have cable.  How do people watch this shit?  
It's not as hard as you'd think to have a group of dedicated servers to support a commerce feature that is built into ones website as a permanent feature, designed to handle heavy traffic.  They already have websites.  Beefing up the servers to handle a heavy traffic would be an investment that would pay off quickly.  I'm not sure why bands haven't done this yet.  There must be a legal reason or something to do with how venues are tied in with ticket master.  Not sure, but the logistics of a commerce system aren't complicated.  Just expensive for high volume applications.  
If we keep fucking who?
I have my doubts...  Let's put it that way.  He'll either gladly go back to his businesses or will call the election results fake and try to stay in office after 4 years.  I would not put it past him to try and force a term extension that leads to him being in power indefinitely.  Who knows.  \n  \nHe's so outlandish, that anything is possible. 
Is this guy Canada's trump-esque douchebag rich guy?
I'd be happy with a super realistic game that lets you play through the actual story, with the main characters.    \n  \nWhy is it so hard to get a good game/sim of some of these great franchises?  Here's looking at you Star Wars.  \n  \n

The "if" needs to be removed from that statement. 
I hope you're right. 
THIS is a good company.  Thanks for your honesty and promptness on this.  
Now that's a headline. 
Yeah, cause it wasn't any good.  Oops.  Am I in the wrong sub for this?    \n  \nTo me, it was just a violent action movie with pretty lame jokes.  Sorry.  \n  \nThe story was weak and it had poor writing throughout.  IMO.  \n  \n
You sound like the kid who didn't want to scratch his skateboard graphics so he didn't learn any tricks.  \n  \nPoser.  Drive this thing hard and love every paint scratching minute of it.  \n  \n
Let's see how much they oppose it by doing exactly what trump tells them.  
Well isn't that convenient.  A convenient mistruth.    
Umm....  Tax returns?  \n  \n \nDid we forget?  
But what are the downfalls of socialism?  
I'm waiting for an interviewer to ask trump something to the effect of:  \n  \nDonny boy, what would you say is something negative that has happened in your life that you would say *was* your fault?  Solely your fault, due to bad judgment or some other mistake.  \n  \n
Tell this to our "president".  
Will this be available through the eshop for download on Wii U?  \n  \nSorry if this has been answered.  \n  \n
So you're okay with treason and perjury?  \n  \nDon't let the complacence of others cloud your judgement.  MAKE it an issue to those you talk to who don't care or try to dismiss it.  We are talking about people lying to sell us out to russia.    \n  \n
Lock him up!  Lock him up!
So it's one thing to be a complete sellout to your corporate overlords and wealthy donors, but it's quite another to actually cause harm to the world you and your family live in.  To be so greedy and short sighted that you actually put business interests over the resources that you and your family rely on for health and safety is one of those head scratching acts that just makes me loose faith in humanity.  It's like, really?\n  \n
**They are all waiting for an attack.**    \n  \n  \nI guarantee it.    \n  \n  \nThat's the impetus they need to really launch their plans.  The real plans.
So what about when there is no broken hymen blood?    \n  \nPlus, do you really want to be in a relationship with someone who has such rigid rules governing their life?  It seems like you enjoyed your freedom before him, now you're living in a way that's compatible with his strict beliefs?  What about yours? \n  \nI don't see this as being sustainable over the long-term.  Your urges and desire for a normal existence will be your downfall.  Get with someone that isn't living in an unrealistic dream world.  \n  \nGood luck either way.  \n  \n\n  \n
This here. 
I'm in denial about my rep.  
Nah, I mean in a fashion that demands a bit more accountability than a fox and friends interview.  That's soft ball shit right there. 
Cause I don't want to view something disturbing?  Is that okay cool guy?
I can almost feel the spins.  
Yep, you're right.  But saying you never did either when asked a direct question about it is called perjury.   \n  \nYou seem rather comfortable with traitors to russia as long as they have an R by their name.  America is more than just R's and D's.    \n  \n
You don't "pop" the SSD on the new macbook pros.  They are permanently fixed into the machine.  
Cause it is stupid and not actually hunting.  If you kill a captive, semi-tamed animal, you've got some issues.  \n  \n
And he volunteered that as a surrogate to the campaign, he never met with any Russians.  Pretty clear instance or perjury regardless of who you support.   
Never used it.  Never will.  Fuck fb.  \n  \nWhy would I feed all my personal communications and details into a system designed to make money from said data?  \n    \n  \nEmail.  It still works great.  And I don't want to hear about how convenient it is to keep up with x,y,z.  Email.  It's great, and you're not feeding zuckerberg's bank account.  \n

I could see Kylo killing her, walking into a room wish us only seeing her back and him emerging with the room glowing and a body on the floor. That would have a huge impact on Luke and Rey and would seal Kylo's fate as a monster. Though it would mean that we would lose such a strong character in a heartbreaking senseless murder.

WASHINGTON, Feb. 28 – Sens. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), Cory Booker (D-N.J.) and Bob Casey (D-Penn.) introduced legislation Tuesday to lower the skyrocketing cost of prescription drugs by allowing Americans to import safe, low-cost medicine from Canada. Reps. Elijah E. Cummings (D-Md.) and Lloyd Doggett (D-Texas) introduced a companion bill in the House.\n\nBoth measures would authorize the secretary of Health and Human Services in two years to allow importation from other advanced countries.\n\nIn Canada and other major countries, the same medications, manufactured by the same companies, in the same factories are available for a fraction of the price compared to the United States. In 2014, Americans spent $1,112 per person on prescription drugs while Canadians spent $772 and Danes spent $325.\n\nWhile five major drug manufacturers made more than $50 billion in profits in 2015, nearly 1 in 5 Americans adult could not afford the medicine they were prescribed.\n\n“I am very proud to join with Sens. Booker and Casey and Reps. Cummings and Doggett and many, many others in the Senate and the House to introduce this critical legislation to lower the outrageous cost of prescription drugs,” Sanders said. “I say to President Trump: Talk is cheap. If you really have the guts to take on the pharmaceutical industry, tell your Republican friends in the House and the Senate to pass this legislation. Do it tonight in your address to Congress. Or admit to the American people that you were lying to them during the campaign.”\n\n“After he was elected, President Trump said he would bring down drug prices. He also warned that the pharmaceutical industry is ‘getting away with murder,’ and he was absolutely right,” Cummings said. “So, if the President really means what he says, he will support our efforts, and he will encourage his Republican colleagues to do the same.”\n\n“This is common-sense legislation that will allow middle class families and seniors access to safe, affordable prescription drugs through importation,” Casey said. “No family should lack access to prescription drugs simply because of the cost; this legislation will increase competition and help more patients access life-saving drugs.”\n\nBooker said, “Life-saving medications will only save lives if people can afford them. Our common-sense legislation is a step forward, allowing for the importation of prescription drugs under a set of strong and effective standards necessary to ensure consumer safety. Since my days as Newark's mayor, I’ve been working to find ways to help more people afford prescription drugs, and this bill will do just that.”\n\n“Prescription price gouging threatens both the health and financial security of too many Americans – overpricing is not limited to one pharmaceutical manufacturer, one CEO, or one class of drugs,” Doggett said. It extends throughout an industry that regularly demands all that a sick or dying patient will pay to recover or just to survive a little longer. From EpiPens to insulin, from cancer to hepatitis C, families and taxpayers bear the burden of others’ greed. Today, we say, Mr. President, 'We are calling you out: stand by your campaign promise.' Act now against price gouging. Restoring some competition by allowing Americans to import more affordable drugs that meet safety standards is one step toward progress.”\n\n“Americans have the safest prescription drug supply in the world, but struggle to afford the exorbitant cost. Consumers should not have to choose between prescription drug safety and affordability. This bill is designed to address this disconnect and ensure that Americans can access safe and affordable medication,” said Sen. Martin Heinrich (D-N.M.), who joined the other members at a press conference to introduce the bill.\n\nThe legislation, the Affordable and Safe Prescription Drug Importation Act, introduced in the Senate and House, would instruct the secretary of Health and Human Services to put forward regulations allowing wholesalers, pharmacies and individuals to import qualifying prescription drugs from licensed Canadian sellers. After two years, the secretary would have the authority to permit importation from countries in the Organizations for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) with standards for the approval and sale of prescription drugs that are comparable to those in the United States.\n\nThe bill includes detailed provisions outlining safeguards and consumer protections that ensure the safety of imported drugs, including FDA certification of foreign sellers, a clear definition of what drugs may be imported and supply chain security requirements.\n\nLegally imported drugs under the bill must be purchased from an FDA-certified foreign seller and must have the same active ingredient, route of administration and strength as drugs approved in the United States. The new agreement also cracks down on rogue online pharmacies.\n\nAllowing the importation of safe and affordable prescription drugs is overwhelmingly supported by the American people with 71 percent in favor of allowing Americans to buy prescription drugs from Canada.\nSens. Martin Heinrich (D-N.M.), Maria Cantwell (D-Wash.) Angus King (I-Maine), Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.), Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.), Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.), Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio), Jack Reed (D-R.I.), Al Franken (D-Minn.), Tammy Baldwin (D-Wisc.), Jeanne Shaheen (D-N.H.), Maggie Hassan (D-N.H.), Tom Udall (D-N.M.), Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.), Richard Blumenthal (D-C.T.) and Debbie Stabenow (D-Mich.) are original co-sponsors of the legislation in the Senate.\n\nOriginal co-sponsors in the House include: Reps. Gwen Moore (D-Wisc.), Robert Brady (D-Penn.), Ro Khanna (D-Calif.), Steve Cohen (D-Tenn.), Rosa DeLauro (D-Conn.), Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.), Barbara Lee (D-Calif.), Marcy Kaptur (D-Ohio), Jan Schakowsky (D-Ill.), Eleanor Holmes Norton (D-D.C.), Chellie Pingree (D-Maine), Peter Welch (D-Vt.), Ed Blumenauer (D-Ore.), Mark Pocan (D-Wisc.) and Jim Langevin (D-R.I.).\n\nOrganizations supporting the bill include: Alliance for Retired Americans, American Federation of Teachers, Center for Medicare Advocacy (CMA), CREDO, DailyKos, Economic Policy Institute, Justice in Aging, MoveOn, NAACP, National Center for Health Research, National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare, National Organization for Women, PharmacyChecker.com, Prescription Justice, Progressive Change Campaign Committee, RxRights and Social Security Works.
>That war in Iraq cost us trillions of dollars. Money that should have been spent on healthcare, education, infrastructure, & environmental protection. In other words it is easy to give a powerful speech about why we have to go to war. But it is far more important that we do everything that we can to solve global conflicts without going to war.
>Yesterday, I sat down with renowned educator and scientist Bill Nye The Science Guy to talk about how we can transform our energy system to renewable energy. Last year, the number of U.S. jobs in solar energy overtook those in oil and natural gas for the first time. As Mr. Nye says, we can solve this problem, but only if we have the courage to stand up to the fossil fuel industry and make it clear that we are going forward with investing in green jobs and protecting our environment.  \n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/senatorsanders/videos/10155680230237908/
>The truth is that some of what President Trump said tonight, it sounds good on the surface. But it doesn't sound so good if you dig just a little bit deeper beneath the surface. President Trump told us that we need to invest a trillion dollars in our infrastructure, in our crumbling infrastructure, to create millions of new jobs. And you know what? He is absolutely right. That's something I have been working on for years. But the specifics of the financing plan that he has provided us, so far, are absolutely wrong. We cannot rebuild our infrastructure by providing billions of dollars in tax breaks to Wall Street and large corporations.  \n\n>Donald Trump said tonight that we need to promote clean air and clean water. And to be very honest with you, because I was only a few feet away from the President, I had a difficult time not laughing out loud when he said that. Because on this very very day, he signed an executive order rolling back President Obama's clean water rules, and has appointed the most anti-environmental EPA administrator in our nation's history.  \n\n>President Trump said tonight that he wants to substantially increase funding for the Pentagon. What he didn't say tonight is that he will come up with that $84 billion dollars in increased funding for the Pentagon by slashing programs that benefit the working people of this country, that benefit the elderly, that benefit the children, the sick, and the poor. Now here's the truth. At a time when our country spends more on defense than the next twelve countries combined, when virtually every major defense contractor has committed fraud and has had to pay fines to the federal government for their fraudulent activity, at a time when the Pentagon has buried evidence of $225 billion dollars in bureaucratic waste, President Trump wants to increase defense spending by $84 billion dollars over the next year and a half. And let me be very clear in stating that I think those priorities are wrong. We should not be cutting massively, programs in need and then significantly expanding spending for the military.  \n\n>And let's be also clear, that $84 billion dollars, that President Trump wants to pump into the bloated Pentagon budget, could just as one example, provide free tuition at every public college and university in this country and begin to reduce the crushing burden of student debt in America. That is a choice. Do we add another $80 plus billion to the Pentagon or do we allow every qualified young American the ability to go to college tuition free in a public college or university and substantially reduce student debt. I think the choice is clear. I think we do not need to greatly increase Pentagon spending.  \n\n>And while President Trump wants to slash programs that the elderly, the sick, and the poorest American rely on, he also thinks that it is a great idea to provide nearly $3 trillion dollars in tax breaks to the top one percent. Middle class shrinking, millions of people living in poverty, the rich doing phenomenally well and Donald Trump wants to provide $3 trillion dollars in tax breaks to the people on top. That is an outrage.  \n\n>Furthermore, President Trump claimed tonight, that American corporations pay the highest tax rates in the world, that we're going to have to lower substantially tax rates on large corporations. What he said was untrue. Not true. According the government accountability office, one out of five, one out of five large profitable corporations pays nothing, zero, in federal income tax. Today we are losing $100 billion in revenue every year because corporations are stashing their cash in the Cayman Islands and other offshore tax havens. These corporations don't need a tax cut, they need to start paying their fair share of taxes.  \n\n>Tonight President Trump made it clear, once again, that he plans on working with Republicans in Congress who want to repeal the Affordable Care Act, throw 20 million Americans off of health insurance, privatize Medicare, make massive cuts in Medicade, raise the cost of prescription drugs for seniors, eliminate funding for planned parenthood. While at the same time he wants to give yet another massive tax cut to the wealthiest Americans, which is what would happen if the Affordable Care Act were repealed.  \n\n>As he did during his campaign Donald Trump claimed that he would bring down the cost of prescription drugs. A few weeks ago he even said "the pharmaceutical industry was getting away with murder". But if Donald Trump really wanted to take on the pharmaceutical industry he would have told his Republican friends in the house and in the senate to pass legislation that I introduced today, with twenty senators, allowing Americans to import safe, low cost medicine from Canada. We should not have to pay the highest prices in the world for the medicine we use.  \n\n>Since the beginning of this year we have seen unprecedented grassroots energy from Maine to California. Last week at town hall meetings all round this country and at more than 150 rallies that took place from coast to coast the American people sent a clear message about what they expect from Congress. As a result the Republicans are getting very, very worried. They're not so cocky anymore about simply repealing Obamacare. And they should be worried. Because the American people are standing up. and what they're saying loudly and clearly is "No, you're not going to repeal the Affordable Care Act. No you're not going to destroy it. You are going to improve it. And in my view what we must be doing right now is not only defending the Affordable Care Act, not only improving the Affordable care act, We have got to move forward to join the rest of the industrialized world in guaranteeing healthcare to all people as a right, not a privilege. We must go forward to a Medicare for all single payer program. But defeating these attempts to destroy the Affordable Care Act and transfer even more of our nation's wealth to Donald Trump and his billionaire friends is going to take all of us coming together and making our voices heard.  \n\n\n>Those of you who attended rallies or town hall meetings: Keep showing up! Keep calling Congress! And continue the fight. The Republicans are now on the defensive and we got to continue to push them back. Those of you who haven't taken action yet: We need your voices, we need your action. Only together, when millions of people stand up and fight for economic justice, for social justice, for racial justice, for environmental justice, only then can we create the political revolution that will turn this country around. Thank you all, and have a great evening.  
One factor started with the repeal of the Fairness Doctrine. Conglomerate media's vested interest in continuing their profit driven motives as per their structure, even to unethical ends, was incentivized by the disastrous Citizen's United Supreme Court decision and defended by an oligarchic social structure. American culture has given rise to a two party system more concerned with bolstering a combative front than building coalitions which ends with divisiveness and triangulation. As population and technology grow faster than our biology's ability to keep up our social and business contacts far exceed Dumbar's number and are kept as blind numbers behind screens. This can reduce our connectivity, health, productivity, and fulfillment. The national id is soaked in anxiety, hedonism, and self-centeredness which generates the doubt, fear, and hate that tends to paralyses much beneficial action. Once our media was compromised our monkey see, monkey do process allowed for the reshaping of our other educational institutions once normalization could be manufactured. With a lack of knowledge about civics or civilization, the basic tools to exercise our voice, exert our agency, and enact our will fell into disuse.   \n\nAnother facotr starts with the repeal of Glass–Steagall. Conglomerates ramped up their harvest of our income, our accounts, our credit, our homes, our resources, our institutions, and even our future. Globalization has detached the wealthy from the lands and negated their accountability. Our politicians are rarely diplomats or statesmen, but lawyers bickering over the meaning of phrasing instead of seeing our need or figuring ideal and pragmatic solutions. With transparency obfuscated and the waters muddied our elected public officials become isolated like kids locked in a candy store. Separated from deep community connection and local rituals they become susceptible to the mental health crisis of corruption and slowly turn to the money like sunflowers to golden rays. There's been a great study on how public will has had no significant impact on public policy but that corporate interests are represented roughly equivalent to their financial support. (This is why it's important to connect with and support your local candidates). With the lessons attributed to the Magna Carta fading from memory the rule-of-law becomes a phantom not bound by vigilance to the Nobility that lacks nobility.  \n\nSo with schools & media mute, people isolated, leaders insulated, financial influence unchecked & encouraged, regulatory enforcement enfeebled, the constabulary militarized & turned mercenary, and entrenched power systems vying for defense & dominance... the short answer is enough wasn't done by the citizens who didn't oppose those candidates, including the ones who supported them.  \n\nIt's not fair that we have to earn what should be ours by right: good governance. But it is as real as the room you're sitting in now. Thank you for the needed resistance. Victory rises.
Bonus points for inspiring calls to action.\n

There's been a great study on how public will has had no significant impact on public policy but that corporate interests are represented roughly equivalent to their financial support. (This is why it's important to connect with and support your local candidates). With the lessons attributed to the Magna Carta fading from memory the rule-of-law becomes a phantom not bound by vigilance to the Nobility that lacks nobility.  \n\nSo with schools & media mute, people isolated, leaders insulated, financial influence unchecked & encouraged, regulatory enforcement enfeebled, the constabulary militarized & turned mercenary, and entrenched power systems vying for defense & dominance... we haven't done enough yet.  \n\nIt's not fair that we have to earn what should be ours by right. But it is as real as the room you're sitting in now. Be who we need. Victory rises.
Alight, I'll throw some skin in the game. I'll make calls equal to the total of all people who call today and post in this thread over the next 3 days. If I can't then I'll gild the first 5 people here, and a second random group of 5 more, that have registered for the leaderboard and make calls.
This post isn't about the representative, it's about the man. And I'm glad it is so very hard to distinguish between the two.  \n\n---  \nWith the deck stacked against him and after calling out the dealer as corrupt, I'm glad he chose to not gamble with everyone's future. Sure, I'd have been down for him to run 3rd party or even challenge the DNC's authority. However the risk was great and many disagreed, and it's their future too that he represents. I'm grateful that Bernie, who likely is more disappointed than anyone, was able to inject himself back into the halls of power with great support. It was the right thing to do. #StillSanders  \n  ~  \nThe man that voted against the Iraq war, the man that was invited to call for a moral economy worldwide, the man who ran for President without superpacs, and called them out, who calmly heard out angry BLM protesters, the man who takes to the picket-lines of workers, who was arrested for defending civil rights, the man who refused to run negative campaign ads, the man who is calling for an end to the oligarchic citizens united by uniting citizens, who didn't capitalize on his campaign office being shot, the man who publicly called out the public's contempt for some of the powers that be to their faces, the man that talks WITH people daily, the man who cares about the plight of Native Americans, the man who didn't think about media coverage when he paid his respects on memorial day, who wanted to openly debate his opponents, and the man who reacted to people chanting his name with "Not me, US!"  \n\nThank you Bernie, we're still with you.\n
>Trump and his administration have used rhetoric and pushed policies which support the idea that the West and Islam are incompatible, and that we are in a ongoing war against the Muslim people. You know who else pushes that narrative? Al-Qaeda and ISIS. Trump’s and Bannon’s inflammatory statements and actions are giving ideological ammunition to the terrorists who are seeking new recruits to kill Americans. Al-Qaeda is even featuring Steve Bannon on the cover of their propaganda publication. Thank you President Trump and Mr. Bannon for making our country less safe.

>The truth is that some of what President Trump said tonight, it sounds good on the surface. But it doesn't sound so good if you dig just a little bit deeper beneath the surface. President Trump told us that we need to invest a trillion dollars in our infrastructure, in our crumbling infrastructure, to create millions of new jobs. And you know what? He is absolutely right. That's something I have been working on for years. But the specifics of the financing plan that he has provided us, so far, are absolutely wrong. We cannot rebuild our infrastructure by providing billions of dollars in tax breaks to Wall Street and large corporations.  \n\n>Donald Trump said tonight that we need to promote clean air and clean water. And to be very honest with you, because I was only a few feet away from the President, I had a difficult time not laughing out loud when he said that. Because on this very very day, he signed an executive order rolling back President Obama's clean water rules, and has appointed the most anti-environmental EPA administrator in our nation's history.  \n\n>President Trump said tonight that he wants to substantially increase funding for the Pentagon. What he didn't say tonight is that he will come up with that $84 billion dollars in increased funding for the Pentagon by slashing programs that benefit the working people of this country, that benefit the elderly, that benefit the children, the sick, and the poor. Now here's the truth. At a time when our country spends more on defense than the next twelve countries combined, when virtually every major defense contractor has committed fraud and has had to pay fines to the federal government for their fraudulent activity, at a time when the Pentagon has buried evidence of a $225 billion dollars in bureaucratic waste, President Trump wants to increase defense spending by $84 billion dollars over the next year and a half. And let me be very clear in stating that I think those priorities are wrong. We should not be cutting massively, programs in need and then significantly expanding spending for the military.  \n\n>And let's be also clear, that $84 billion dollars, that President Trump wants to pump into the bloated Pentagon budget, could just as one example, provide free tuition at every public college and university in this country and begin to reduce the crushing burden of student debt in America. That is a choice. Do we add another $80 plus billion to the Pentagon or do we allow every qualified young American the ability to go to college tuition free in a public college or university and substantially reduce student debt. I think the choice is clear. I think we do not need to greatly increase Pentagon spending.  \n\n>And while President Trump wants to slash programs that the elderly, the sick, and the poorest American rely on, he also thinks that it is a great idea to provide nearly $3 trillion dollars in tax breaks to the top one percent. Middle class shrinking, millions of people living in poverty, the rich doing phenomenally well and Donald Trump wants to provide $3 trillion dollars in tax breaks to the people on top. That is an outrage.  \n\n>Furthermore, President Trump claimed tonight, that American corporations pay the highest tax rates in the world, that we're going to have to lower substantially tax rates on large corporations. What he said was untrue. Not true. According the government accountability office, one out of five, one out of five large profitable corporations pays nothing, zero, in federal income tax. Today we are losing $100 billion in revenue every year because corporations are stashing their cash in the Cayman Islands and other offshore tax havens. These corporations don't need a tax cut, they need to start paying their fair share of taxes.  \n\n>Tonight President Trump made it clear, once again, that he plans on working with Republicans in Congress who want to repeal the Affordable Care Act, throw 20 million Americans off of health insurance, privatize Medicare, make massive cuts in Medicade, raise the cost of prescription drugs for seniors, eliminate funding for planned parenthood. While at the same time he wants to give yet another massive tax cut to the wealthiest Americans, which is what would happen if the Affordable Care Act were repealed.  \n\n>As he did during his campaign Donald Trump claimed that he would bring down the cost of prescription drugs. A few weeks ago he even said "the pharmaceutical industry was getting away with murder". But if Donald Trump really wanted to take on the pharmaceutical industry he would have told his Republican friends in the house and in the senate to pass legislation that I introduced today, with twenty senators, allowing Americans to import safe, low cost medicine from Canada. We should not have to pay the highest prices in the world for the medicine we use.  \n\n>Since the beginning of this year we have seen unprecedented grassroots energy from Maine to California. Last week at town hall meetings all round this country and at more than 150 rallies that took place from coast to coast the American people sent a clear message about what they expect from Congress. As a result the Republicans are getting very, very worried. They're not so cocky anymore about simply repealing Obamacare. And they should be worried. Because the American people are standing up. and what they're saying loudly and clearly is "No, you're not going to repeal the Affordable Care Act. No you're not going to destroy it. You are going to improve it. And in my view what we must be doing right now is not only defending the Affordable Care Act, not only improving the Affordable care act, We have got to move forward to join the rest of the industrialized world in guaranteeing healthcare to all people as a right, not a privilege. We must go forward to a Medicare for all single payer program. But defeating these attempts to destroy the Affordable Care Act and transfer even more of our nation's wealth to Donald Trump and his billionaire friends is going to take all of us coming together and making our voices heard.  \n\n\n>Those of you who attended rallies or town hall meetings: Keep showing up! Keep calling Congress! And continue the fight. The Republicans are now on the defensive and we got to continue to push them back. Those of you who haven't taken action yet: We need your voices, we need your action. Only together, when millions of people stand up and fight for economic justice, for social justice, for racial justice, for environmental justice, only then can we create the political revolution that will turn this country around. Thank you all, and have a great evening.  \n\nwww.facebook.com/senatorsanders/videos/10155681411947908/
I'd be interested in a dramatic reading of this, as I couldn't find one.
If we are going to go back over the battles behind us this seems the right reason: Not to hang blame, but to now take on the responsibility for finding proper solutions as we go forward. That way we don't drag on our momentum by digging in there instead of putting our efforts into what can be done here, now. That way we can be both driven by our past and drawn toward the future we believe in. Learn this lesson well and seize victory. The means of that production comes from our hearts and from our minds. This is worth the work. Be who we need. [Remember this.](https://i.imgur.com/PMUFso1.png)    \n\nwww.youtube.com/watch?v=XPJiPEzdF4c

To you, the reader, I have this to say. I don't know what time it is where you are or what it sounds like. I don't know what you last ate or how your relationships are. I know there is decency in you though. You've helped, you've enjoyed, you've struggled. We share this time, and this ever shrinking planet. There are more of us now than imaginable not so long ago. There are legions of descent folk, those in houses and offices in endless fields around you. We are driven by our pasts to our future. We get to decide what that past will be. And that will decide what the future will be too. Not because the past we make will earn it. But because we will. That past will simply be evidence of our results.  \n\nWe will not tolerate the hilariously outnumbered oligarchs to sell our future from under us. That is our time. Our life. And I intend to live as if it is. There is not too much in our way, it is not overwhelming, it is a facade, a slimy salesman's smile. Your trust is not a play thing. Build it with everyday folk, judge people on their character, see broader than the contention. Take a break from the force-fed normalcy. Listen to voices of those not paid to talk to you. Listen to your humanity. The torch of civilization burns so bright it is hurting us. And yet on we must run. Let's carry it together.\n\nFirm handshake, be open, they are us. This doesn't end until we come together.\nBe willing to set an example. Don't make an exception for yourself. Be well.
And yet the thunder grows. I think it speaks to our situation and tenacity.
Will Focus on Economy in the South\nFriday, March 3, 2017\n\nWASHINGTON, March 3 – Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) will join civil rights and labor leaders Saturday outside a Nissan Motor Co. plant in Canton, Mississippi, to demand that the automaker respect the rights of workers to form a union.\n\n“I am proud to join the fight to give Nissan’s workers the justice, dignity and the right to join a union that they deserve,” Sanders said. “What the workers are doing is a courageous and enormously important effort to improve their lives.”\n\nNissan has union representation at 42 out of its 45 plants around the world, but not in Mississippi or Tennessee. “The American South should not be treated differently,” Sanders said.\n\nThe plant is in a state where the overall poverty rate of 22 percent and childhood poverty of more than 31 percent are the worst in the county. The official unemployment rate of 6.5 percent ranks Mississippi 46th among all states. Only 6.6 percent of Mississippi workers are labor union members. That number is increasing but still low compared to almost 11 percent nationwide.\n\nThe Mississippi Alliance for Fairness at Nissan organized the March on Mississippi. Rep. Bennie Thompson (D-Miss.), actor Danny Glover, NAACP President Cornell William, former Ohio state Sen. Nina Turner and Mississippi NAACP President Derrick Johnson also will join the rally and march. Building on demonstrations last month at Nissan dealerships across the South, Saturday’s rally will begin at 12:30 p.m. CST at the Canton Sportsplex before demonstrators march two miles to Nissan’s assembly plant.\n\nThe Canton plant opened in 2003 after Mississippi lawmakers gave Nissan $1.3 billion in tax breaks in hopes of creating good-paying, full-time jobs. Despite expectations, Nissan repeatedly has violated the rights of its workers. Most recently, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration on Feb. 10 proposed a $21,000 fine because a poorly-trained assembly line worker lost three fingers. The National Labor Relations Board in 2015 found that Nissan unlawfully threatened to fire workers and close the plant if workers union­ize. A new complaint was filed with the board late Thursday accusing the company of unlawfully ordering workers to stop leafleting in a plant parking lot.\n\n“It’s time for Nissan to walk the walk when it comes to the civil rights of its employees,” worker Robin Moore wrote in an op-ed published Thursday in The (Jackson, Mississippi) Clarion-Ledger. “Back when the plant opened,” she added,” people in Mississippi had high hopes that Nissan would bring good jobs to the impoverished and overwhelmingly black community of Canton. And I for one am grateful for my job. But in the years since, things have gone down. Nissan has driven down pay, eliminated benefits and imposed punishing production schedules while skimping on basic health and safety equipment.”  
"The essence of his campaign is bigotry. It is bigotry. It is trying to divide this country up. It is telling us that we are supposed to hate Muslims. We are supposed to hate Mexicans. If we are men, we're supposed to hate women."  \n  \nhttps://www.facebook.com/berniesanders/videos/1339564839431850/
>I will be joining civil rights and labor leaders tomorrow outside the Nissan Motor Co. plant in Canton, Mississippi, to demand that the automaker respect the rights of workers to form a union. What the workers are doing is a courageous and enormously important effort to improve their lives. Nissan has union representation at 42 out of its 45 plants around the world, but not in Mississippi or Tennessee. The American South should not be treated differently.\n\n>What I have always believed and I think the facts are very clear, is that people who are in a union and can collectively bargain a contract, earn more money and have better working conditions than those who are not in a union. That it just common sense. We have got to end the race to the bottom. Low wages in one state impact workers everywhere. Our job: Stand with workers for better wages, better working conditions and for the right to form a union.  \n\nhttps://pbs.twimg.com/media/C6AF31iUsAEiRPh.jpg
I do know that I think Arturo will do a stellar job, I don't know enough about Kenneth to compare on the issues or from their patterns of record. I'm a big fan of the Green Party movement's ideals and have been proud of my support for them. Hopefully another user or someone from either campaign will highlight the contrasts.

Victory rises like a tide during a flood. It don't matter where the water comes from but it certainly matters it's here.
>Good evening. Before I respond to President Trump's speech and what he said tonight, I wanted to say a few words about what he didn't say because when you analyze the speech, sometimes what is said is more important than what someone does not say, as opposed to what they actually say.   \n\n>Some examples, at a time when over half of older Americans have no retirement savings, I did not hear President Trump say one word, not one word, about Social Security or Medicare. During the campaign as we all remember, President Trump promised over and over and over again that he would not cut Social Security, Medicare, or Medicade. It was a cornerstone of his campaign. But in his first address to the nation, he didn't even mention Social Security or Medicare once. Not a single time. Even worse, President Trump has proposed a massive cut to Medicade. Massive cut. Threatening the nursing home care of millions of senior citizens and the health care of many, many of our children. I urge President Trump: Keep your promises. Tell the American people, tweet the American people, that you will not cut Social Security, Medicare, and Medicade.  \n\n>Further, I did not hear President Trump tonight mention, mention, the words "income" and "wealth inequality". Or the fact that we now have the widest gap between the very rich and everyone else, since the 1920's. I did not hear President Trump mention the fact that as a result of the disastrous Citizen's United Supreme Court decision, a five to four decision, we now have a corrupt campaign finance system that is allowing billionaires to buy elections and undermine American democracy. How could you give a speech, to the nation, and not talk about that enormously important decision.  \n\n>Furthermore, not only did President Trump not mention the issue of voter suppression, what Republican Governors are doing all over this country to make it harder for people to participate in our democracy, but the truth of the matter is his administration is now working, working overtime with Republican Governors to make it harder for young people, low income people, senior citizens, and people of color to vote. That is an outrage.  \n\n>Perhaps most astoundingly, at a time when the scientific community is virtually unanimous in telling us that climate change is real, that it is caused by human activity, that it is already causing devastating problems in our country and all over the world, I did not hear President Trump say one word, not one word, about the need to combat climate change. The greatest environmental threat facing our planet. Not only did he not mention climate change, he pledged to increase our dependency on fossil fuels.  \n\n>Furthermore, at a time when we have more people in jail than any other country on Earth, disproportionately, African American, Latino, Native American, I did not hear President Trump say one word about how he was going to fix a broken criminal justice system. Yes, we must support the hard work of men and women in the police departments and the sheriff's departments all over this country. But we must also end the disgrace of having more people in jail than any other country on Earth.  \n\n>Furthermore, at a time when we need the best educated workforce in the world to compete in a highly competitive global economy, I did not hear President Trump say one word, not one word, about the need to lower the cost of college, and to do what countries all over the world are doing, and that is to make public colleges and universities tuition free. It's an enormously important issue, impacting millions of families around this country. Not one word about making colleges more affordable, not one word about addressing the crisis of student debt.  \n\n>During his campaign President Trump told us he was gonna take on Wall Street and "drain the swamp". Remember that? He was going to "drain the swamp". Well the swamp, big time, is now in his administration. Which has more millionaires and billionaires than any Presidential administration in history. Amazingly enough for somebody who was going to "drain the swamp", who was going to take on Wall Street, his chief economic advisor, Gary Cohn, is the former president of Goldman Sachs. One of the financial institutions that paid billions of dollars in fines for their illegal activity. That's really "draining the swamp"  Needless to say I did not hear President Trump say anything about another campaign promise he made to the American people, and that was to reinstate the Glass-Stiegel Act. Now that's a little bit about what Trump did not say tonight. Let me just say a few words about what he did say.  
Now it's your turn to turn up the heat. With your help victory is still ahead of us. The struggle is far from over.                                      \nA Special Election is being held April 4th for California's 34th Congressional District.

There's a large group of revolutionaries and the vast majority of us overlap some with the movement championed by r/esist. I'm in both camps but welcome either almost without exception and some others too. There's a whole lot of people who are causal, measured, or semi-aware of their involvement and I'm also glad for their semi-positive culture in places.

How could you give a speech, to the nation, and not talk about that enormously important decision.  \n\n>Furthermore, not only did President Trump not mention the issue of voter suppression, what Republican Governors are doing all over this country to make it harder for people to participate in our democracy, but the truth of the matter is his administration is now working, working overtime with Republican Governors to make it harder for young people, low income people, senior citizens, and people of color to vote. That is an outrage.  \n\n>Perhaps most astoundingly, at a time when the scientific community is virtually unanimous in telling us that climate change is real, that it is caused by human activity, that it is already causing devastating problems in our country and all over the world, I did not hear President Trump say one word, not one word, about the need to combat climate change. The greatest environmental threat facing our planet. Not only did he not mention climate change, he pledged to increase our dependency on fossil fuels.  \n\n>Furthermore, at a time when we have more people in jail than any other country on Earth, disproportionately, African American, Latino, Native American, I did not hear President Trump say one word about how he was going to fix a broken criminal justice system. Yes, we must support the hard work of men and women in the police departments and the sheriff's departments all over this country. But we must also end the disgrace of having more people in jail than any other country on Earth.  \n\n>Furthermore, at a time when we need the best educated workforce in the world to compete in a highly competitive global economy, I did not hear President Trump say one word, not one word, about the need to lower the cost of college, and to do what countries all over the world are doing, and that is to make public colleges and universities tuition free. It's an enormously important issue, impacting millions of families around this country. Not one word about making colleges more affordable, not one word about addressing the crisis of student debt.  \n\n>During his campaign President Trump told us he was gonna take on Wall Street and "drain the swamp". Remember that? He was going to "drain the swamp". Well the swamp, big time, is now in his administration. Which has more millionaires and billionaires than any Presidential administration in history. Amazingly enough for somebody who was going to "drain the swamp", who was going to take on Wall Street, his chief economic advisor, Gary Cohn, is the former president of Goldman Sachs. One of the financial institutions that paid billions of dollars in fines for their illegal activity. That's really "draining the swamp"  Needless to say I did not hear President Trump say anything about another campaign promise he made to the American people, and that was to reinstate the Glass-Stiegel Act. Now that's a little bit about what Trump did not say tonight. Let me just say a few words about what he did say.  
It's not fair that we have to earn what should be ours by right. But the only way this stops is when we make it. Be who we need. Victory rises.

>Here is the good news. Two months ago, Republicans talked about repealing Obamacare, throwing 20 million people off their insurance. But now the Republicans are getting very, very worried. They're not so cocky anymore because of the actions of millions of people who have stood up to demand they do not repeal Obamacare. Our job now is to look beyond their rhetoric about a “replacement” plan. When they talk about block granting Medicaid, what they really mean is making massive cuts. When they talk about selling health insurance across state lines, what they really mean is allowing companies to go to states with no regulations so that they can sell plans with very little coverage. Our job is to improve Obamacare, not destroy it, and to eventually move toward a Medicare-for-all system.   \n\nhttps://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/02/28/opinion/28leonhardtSub/28leonhardtSub-master768.jpg
>The resistance grows. Tens of thousands of people came out this week at 152 rallies in 120 congressional districts from Eugene, Oregon, to Providence, Rhode Island. The message to Trump and the Republicans is clear: Do not repeal the Affordable Care Act. Improve it. Do not throw 20 million people off of health care. Do not allow insurance companies to discriminate against those with pre-existing conditions. Do not remove young people from their parents' insurance policies. Do not force women to pay more than men for health care. Do not ask seniors to pay, on average, $2,000 a year more for prescription drugs. Our job: Short term we must defend and improve the Affordable Care Act. Long term, we must have the United States join the rest of the industrialized world in guaranteeing health care for every man, woman and child through a Medicare for All program.  \n\n

>Republicans in Congress are returning to their old obsession of trying to defund Planned Parenthood. Let's be clear. Republicans’ plan to repeal Obamacare has nothing to do with improving health care. They want to defund Planned Parenthood simply because it provides abortions, even though that is a constitutional right. Their repeal of the Obamacare would make patients unable to use Medicaid coverage at Planned Parenthood. This directly hurts low-income women, who are the biggest beneficiaries of Planned Parenthood's health care. Four out of five of those who benefit are at or below 150% of the poverty line. Our job: Fight back. Do not allow Republicans to hurt millions of women with their extreme right-wing agenda.  \n\nhttp://www.motherjones.com/files/imagecache/top-of-content-image/pp-capitol.jpg

How's his media coverage that's not on the net doing these days? I think it's important to see protests become normalized and our leaders demonstrating how to use our voice effectively. This stops when the populous decides it does.
3.) Report Your Successes & Pride About Local Engagement: Sure it's bragging, and why not. Please stand up and let others be inspired by your work. Thanks.
There's a large part that's not about the labels that get so much attention. Who are these politicians? Are they skilled? Grounded? Do they have a recorded pattern of representing the public's interests. What is their transparency and access like? Their support must come from the populous. They must use their voice effectively and with integrity. So must we. For, and I truly believe this, in a different way than their opportunity to represent us in their occupation, they can not show more character than is representative of ours.

>Trump and his administration have used rhetoric and pushed policies which support the idea that the West and Islam are incompatible, and that we are in a ongoing war against the Muslim people. You know who else pushes that narrative? Al-Qaeda and ISIS. Trump’s and Bannon’s inflammatory statements and actions are giving ideological ammunition to the terrorists who are seeking new recruits to kill Americans. Al-Qaeda is even featuring Steve Bannon on the cover of their propaganda publication.

He wouldn't have run in the first place if he wasn't willing to serve both terms. Also we know how far he'll go 'to do everything in his power to stop Trump from being president'. All I know is that if we support the revolution enough it'll be much more likely we'll win and that he'll preside over the victory.

>There's a reason why Republicans don't want to face their constituents at town hall meetings. As they play politics with people's lives and move forward with repealing Obamacare, which would throw 20 million people off of health care, the number of Americans who view Obamacare favorably is almost a record high. To Republicans I say: Do your job. Listen to your constituents. This is not what the people want.

I don't know you from Adam, haven't read any replies, didn't do my homework, so please take no personal offense, but are you a real person? Or are you a fauxcade of platitudes, practiced smiles, and talking points? Some of us just want something real (and good). I get it, you're one of the good ones, and you need to play by the real rules. This pressing inquiry would be better brought to bear on the people you are fighting against. Fight for us. You're a person sitting in a room somewhere that we have entrusted a bit of our power to help us. What do you do when you get overwhelmed at work? How do you spend your days? What metric do do compare with your colleges? Please, I just want to know what shape you think we are really in and what we can really do about it. Enough of this kids table shit. There's lead in our water, a robotic army on our world, a new class of nobles in our lives, and heart disease or cancer in our futures. We all know what is going on. Please get out in front of the direction we're going and lead us through this momentum. But first tell me what you would *really* do with full control over media policy. What's your understanding about that tv has become our elders & educators and that all of *this* is just an idea?
I've been looking into seeing if there's a foreign ethical wage / union call center, a trustworthy efficient way to handle the finances, and to make sure of the legality of the operation, that could turn international support into support for candidates and elections. Theoretically, would that be interest to any of you? [I hereby pledge to not personally gain financially in any way if anything becomes of this, nor would I want to ever set it up so that I could.]
I agree except for the 'first' part (my faith has since been rebolstered too). I'm not a member of the DNC and though I put some effort in combating the internal issues I still want to put the oligarchy on the defensive on all fronts.
>Republican cowards in Arizona introduced a bill to punish protesters. The answer was more protesting. The people of Arizona stood up, fought back and won. The Arizona House Speaker withdrew the bill after receiving hundreds of phone calls. Across this nation we are seeing young and old people, white people and people of color, gay and straight people come together to resist an agenda that aims to silence them. Congratulations to those in Arizona who stood up for their fundamental rights to free speech and organized demonstrations.  \n\nhttp://www.azcentral.com/story/news/politics/legislature/2017/02/27/why-gov-doug-ducey-wont-have-weigh-arizonas-controversial-protest-bill/98474882/
I thought the encouragement and kudos would be generally welcome. I certainly read the term 'Republican' here to denote the team of elected officials and not so much the rank and file (otherwise I wouldn't have shared here). I believe that sentiment is that from the past 40 days or so there has been a marked increase in effective demonstration against their efforts. 
Whoa. That's huge.\n\nThat Trump tried to direct the FBI on what to say... of course he would but wow, there it is. He's trying to control the story, control the media that he can control. That's upsetting. \n\nAnd Comney saying no. Comney is a spineless coward, but I guess he has a line somewhere. All is not forgiven and won't be until he INVESTIGATES TRUMP (but really never will be), but in this specific instance, he's finally done one thing right. 
That's getting ~~perilously~~ I mean tantalizingly close* to what got Nixon. We need a modern-day 'Deep Throat'.\n\n*interfering with an ongoing investigation. Trump is not so subtly telling the FBI what he "expects" the final result will be. Or else.
One good way to know if a professor is going to give an honest answer is if he's a professor at an accredited university. That's usually a decent indicator. 
I think a better approach would be to remove Federal Funding, so the Federal Government -would/should- have no say.
That would destroy some schools and push the cost of tuition farther into the sky.

Not a Hunter, but totally support it, in ways that make sense. Awesome words.
As young guy, I worked at least a few jobs, that are likely what you are asking about. In my case, usually machinist or welding "stations".\n\nIn terms of difficulty or tasks, some places run differently than others, but generally - I think I would see where a "Master Machinist" would setup a station, getting the dies correct, and making sure the base material can easily, perhaps in a single or a few steps, become a "part". So once he setup the machine, you have a kid, or lower skilled worker, sit there and make a hundred or thousand of whatever.\n\nSo yeah - to me it is completely mind numbing. But, lets be fair, there are some people in this world who don't live for a mental challenge every day they show up at work. Some guys/ladies, were retired, and really just wanted an easy job they could do, while chatting with their friend/co-worker all day. Some were kids, who, needed to build up their common sense working around dangerous equipment. And others I recall - were people who were, working towards something else, and also - some worked 2 jobs - so mindless was appealing there.\n\n
Pile-On to this very good advice - 3) and 4) are rules to live by there. I am the guy that found the Strip Bars that had Cool Girls that Danced to Music I liked [In my case it was obscure heavy metal/rock - so not the typical stuff].

I would put forth that, it one thing to ask an intelligent question, another to ask a stupid question.\n\nSimilarly, , you needn't be wrong by speaking as if you know something, if you don't really know, and can't argue the point with a fact backed, logical explanation and reasoning. Don't speak as if it is something you KNOW. Caveat the statement such as, "I always thought it worked this way" - or "I was lead to believe".
13 I think, pretty sure we were 14-ish in ninth grade.
My Grandfather (WWII Era Man) died in the early 50s, with 4 young children, which left my Grandmother often having to work 2 jobs as she could. Before my Grandfather had died, he was installing a bathroom in the house (there was only an out-house). That toilet and bathtub were left in the "future-bathroom-location" my whole life. It is a metaphor for what happened, any 'upward/progressive' movement stopped, and I think everyone was just trying their best, not to lose what they had.\nMy mother died when I was 5, and I think again, what I saw was, a few years of Dad just trying to figure out what he could do. My father always worked very hard, and very long hours, as a Blue-collar worker, having made it all the way through 8th grade.\n\nSo financially, how did we [My Grandmother, My Father and I] cope? I think it was - work harder, longer.\n
Totally agree, 11/10 times.

So - Just in general terms, I have always thought of Voldemort, to be not unlike Hitler. \n\nHe had a passion and a certain set of skills when he was a young man, they were used to get him into and access to a certain level of power. However, the passion and access to power, then flounders, he is capable of bad decisions, and makes several very bad decisions, abusing his "friends" that helped him get that power, and his mental state became more "fragile", meaning the pride and a false sense of his own capability, would lead to a downfall.\n 
"Doable"? \nSo WHERE - EXACTLY is the wording that made you draw that silly little conclusion?
I trust that Trump, will do what is in his personal best interest.
OK - You stated that the house you seemingly are part owner in, is being rented out and you have not seen any income from this. This alone seems to me to show you NEED a lawyer. I mean, the lawyer can help you understand some of the questions that need asking, like - who was the executor of her will? You should have been notified of this? And in my opinion, you have some money owed to you that should cover the lawyer.
Can't wait until he is "gone".
Da MAN!!! Cool Deal.\n\nI'll make yet another suggestion.\n\nMaybe compromise, between what you have in your mind as "The Ideal Ring for the girl you love", and what she indicated she would she would be "Happy with"? - I am just trying to help you explore all the options.\nSO like - there are some "plain" type engagement bands that maybe  have some small stones in them, that can be worn, with / next to something much larger and more ornate, that you can buy her, say one your 10yr wedding anniversary, or something along those lines. \n\nAlso, are you aware of what other stones she likes? I mean, some really prefer the plain "Diamond" look, but some girls PREFER color, so maybe Emerald or Sapphire, with smaller Diamonds/Other paired next to it? They are not Alot cheaper, really, but it might save a couple hundred bucks, and maybe be preferred?\n\nJust throwing it out there..

Save some of that money, to the point where you can buy the ring, or a new(er) car cash (Not recommending you pay for them in cash, just that you have the money)\n\nSave.\n\nGirls/Women like rings and diamonds and all, but they can also be comforted (many woman equate this to stability) to know you are financially responsible, and have a nice chunk of cash in your bank account.
Don't recall them mentioning Security...
Yeah, Right there with this Sir.\nI was in my first year of Art School - barely followed the news in that era, but I recall thinking - "Hunh- What does that mean...??"\n\nHard thing to wrap your head around what might lead up to that as a young dude.\n

THIS -If you work your case plan, the Court (generally speaking) absolutely wants to return children to their biological parent(s)/family.\n\nBad parents on drugs can often "work the social workers" assigned so that they get multiple opportunities.\n\nOn another note though, if you are having difficulties keeping up a normal life, do you have visitation to know they are happy where they are?

Adopting a "new born" I found, it is hard to "not" have that bond. You are the child's "everything" and only parent(s) they know until they are old enough to begin to understand their story. It isn't as incomprehensible as I imagined as a younger man. \n\nGood on your parent(s) OP!\n\n:)\n\n
I would suggest maybe OP provide bit more clarity on the question, [Organic Farming I am assuming here, not Organic Food] but to start with:\n\nSo as an example -chemicals- , well plants NEED chemicals to grow. I get that you are asking about perhaps additional “artificially concentrated” chemicals, such a nitrogen “N”? So yes, Nitrogen is an example of an artificial chemical concentration that can be applied [Though I think of it more that, it is N that is “more available” to the plant, than what is already in the soil], but, most people are not associating Nitrogen as something they don't want associated with their produce. In this particular example, a concentration of Nitrogen based fertilizer can be applied early on to provide needed nutrients to the plant, that allows it to grow very quickly. An additional benefit is, for certain crops, that when applied very directly to the plants, it gives them a boost to help them "beat out" the weeds that are soon to be around them, competing for nutrients. Another example I think of what you are referring to would be Lime, to perhaps adjust the soil Ph. Typically, I find the major complaint(s) in this area is -well the farmer will say the cost, and anyone else concerned would likely say runoff is bad, when it is applied such that runoff occurs. However, as an example of a “more organic” fertilizer, cow manure, you will still have concern when this is applied, be it the smell, how much is used, where it is stored before application, etc etc.\n\nThat brings along another possible application, herbicides. These are used to reduce "weeds" or many other competing plants. I suspect this is the beginning of the seriously contentious area - and likely applies more to "organic" [What is Organic-exactly?]\nSo herbicides, again, trying to apply such that any runoff is minimal, [everyone hates runoff - for the farmer he didn't get the value out of the expensive product, and the environmentalist because it gets in the waterways - and effect other ecosystems other than the field intended. This is a large area, from a product perspective, so it includes many “chemical types” used to kill/retard various plant types.\n\nAnd then there is, sorta the big one, which is Pesticides. So this is trying to kill bugs/pests to the crop. The pesticide types can vary, depending on crops and location. This is also often applied directly to what you are eating, so this tends to be high profile.\n\nAt best, Organic Produce has limited “chemicals” touching/in them. Organic works to varying degrees, small scale, and to get a good product, it will be more expensive, sometimes much more expensive.\n
Yeah, that is pretty nice. Like that, little bit MacAlpine/Howe -ish.
I might add though, that, for a gaming cafe, he could setup a system to monitor internet/network utilization [Cacti. etc], so they can understand how they can scale up various games they might be playing online. I think this depends on how far you want to take it. I could imagine myself as a young man, spending alot of time at a place like that.
Computers - If you are good with them, is a good path for financial/job security.\n\nConsider and research Computer Certifications:\n\nA+ and Network+ and Security+ = The Basics\n\nOnce you attain the below Certs, with Some Experience you will exceed your Salary Requirement:\n\nMCSE = This path is good if you like working on Servers - and you can setup a home lab using Virtual Machines pretty easy.\n\nCCNA = The path if you are interested in Computer Networks.\n\nEDIT: Also should add - I responded because, I am a "former" motorhead, and I didn't get into computers until I was your age [before that it was just a hobby]. It was the 90's, so a bit of a different time, but I have a very stable career, and salary.\n
I did this, that is not a hard one.
Thanks - Love the contribution, Wish I had my GrandMoms Hobart.
Not  pro here, but I believe I would describe withholding percentage as an increasing scale, where basically, the more you make the higher your tax is. And so what happens if you get some "large" check [say one that is much more than your regular check],  your withholding percentage is calculated, as if you made that much all the time.\n\nBut as has already been said - the final amount you owe/refund will be determined at the end of the year, and so you would likely get that back.

You sharing this, is valuable for some others, I would think. Sometimes its hard to fathom how often this happens.\n\nI think the closest I have ever been to this was a girl, in my ninth grade class. She was a model, like for clothing catalogs, and was raped by a guy she worked with. The only reason she told me was because I asked her what classes she had in eight grade, and she said she had a tutor most of the year because she was raped. She said I was the only person she had told.\n\nI respected that secret until now - basically. I knew she felt, well.. all messed up about, an I couldn't really even process what that even meant. Basically, I can sure see why a normal reaction would be to deal with it internally for a long time.\nSorry that happened to you.
Yeah, so our second adoption (was in a different county court) was very much like that, I mean they had stuffed animals and had decorated the courtroom - and they couldn't really hide how happy they all were.\n\nThe first one, you could tell they were excited, but in that county, there were alot more adoptions happening that day, so it was a little more, in-and-out.
Is there a way to have this on the front page for a few years? It sure would save me a lot of aggravation.

I am curious to know why you would think it is good to have a balance on your CC? [Note: it is BAD - your credit score wants you to have many creditors trust you with a high amount of credit, and for you to have not used (run a balance) that credit.] Check out Credit Karma.

"How about the local government builds a homeless shelter"\n\nSo - this is exactly why they are fining this Church. The local governments wants YOUR TAXPAYER DOLLARS to fund another project, so the available fund for the pool of corruption grows larger.

I actually just replayed it last year - that was long enough for me to forget a good bit.\n\nI can't understand why there isn't another game like this in the works. It would be great if they could tie something into the new movies.
Like in Destiny, there's those three level 18 Hive in the subway station right at the beginning. 
Well, if they were 256 gig phones, those sell 850 new, she could resell them for (let's say) 700, 700 x 20 is 14000, that could be a down payment on a house. 
It's pretty great. I love how slow it can get. I don't think you can get a much more versatile phaser in that small of a box.

I don't understand why they didn't just raise the price back up. I think it's dumb that you can buy DT and Bumba's right off the bat. \n\nBut, when it's this cheap, and I can regen health and mana by soloing camps and not delay my build by having to return to base to buy it, why wouldn't I buy it as a mid? 
Hm, I thought it could only do specific voltages, can the device ask for anything between 5 and 20 volts?

It's not about BMing the jungler, the price drop means mids are actively looking to last hit so THEY can sustain. \n\nFrankly I think they need to remove the last hit requirement AND raise the price back up.

There are likely some Young Democrats and/or College Democrats groups in your area. Find out when/where they meet and go to a few. Should be able to learn how they got their groups together.

The enemy is always lurking, awaiting the chance to strike. I've seen this happen with people with 25 years and more sober. Many never made it back. \n\nClimb back on the horse and strap yourself in. \n
I expect that to improve over time.\n\nOne item in particular 'But Obama ranked fifth from the bottom on "relations with Congress,"' is more that a bit unfair as he was the first president to have the entirety of the GOP and a complete news wing arrayed against him since before the first inauguration.

The America you remember began to die on 9-11. The trumpster is just the end point on that.\n\nEvery time we take off our belts and shoes bin Ladin won.\n\nEvery time we lash out at Muslims, Jews, women, POCs bin Ladin won. \n\nThe trumpster's win was a win for bin Laden. \n\nToo many in this country jump at their own shadows, giving bin Ladin the win. \n\n\n\n
46 dems, 52 repubs, 2 repubs voting no leaves 48 to 50, and a couple seats not voting. Pence can break a tie. \n
There is no reasoning with crazy. Even Scalia said the 2nd was neither inviolate or sacrosanct - that limits were applicable. Mostly because of crazy people. \n

I'm in Alabama. We already have open carry, except in places where it would serve a purpose like the state house and capital. \n\nThat said, all open carry has done so far is increase shootings and murders.

Not sure they could do that - too much bro-love. They'd work out some kind of deal where (probably) Moore would go for SC and Beauregard for guv - with both endorsing each other.\n

\n"I hope you can join me on February 11th for the 11th annual Moral March on Raleigh & HKonJ People's Assembly. This mass mobilization has happened every February since 2007. It is a time when the North Carolina NAACP and over 200 coalition partners come together with people from across the nation to show our unity and reaffirm our intersectional People's Agenda for North Carolina. This march is more important than ever.\n\nWe are focusing on our moral duty to stand against the repeal of the life-saving Affordable Care Act, the legislative tyranny of our extremist-led General Assembly, the racist and unconstitutional gerrymandering which undermines the vote of all North Carolinians, the anti-family, anti-worker, and anti-LGBTQ hate bill 2, and the extremism and lies of Trumpism , which undermine our Democracy at the federal and local level. Donald Trump and his administration have undermined our Democracy and democratic institutions by making regressive federal appointments and inviting white nationalists into the White House. They have demonized our immigrant and Muslim sisters and brothers by building a wall on our Mexican border, pushing through an Executive Order that effectively bans many refugees and Muslims from our country, and blaming Latinos for voter fraud that does not exist.\n\nI know that the struggles that we face in our state are not unique. We have seen a rise in extremism across the nation. The Moral Movement here in North Carolina has national implications and we are encouraging people from around the country to join us. We are also seeing a rise in moral resistance. The Women's March showed us that the country is ready for a moral revolution of values. The Moral March on Raleigh on February 11th is essential to deepening this fight across the South.\n\n\nThere are several ways that you can support the Moral March on Raleigh.\n\nFirst and foremost, I hope that you and your leadership will join us on Saturday, February 11th. You can find more information about the time, location, and logistics by clicking here. We hope you will also share information about the Moral March on Raleigh with your members or organizational affiliates, particularly those in North Carolina. If you need more information or resources, you can email laurel@naacpnc.org.\n\nYou can also support the Moral March through social media. Click here to view the Moral March Digital Action Guide which provides several tools and describes a video campaign we are using to promote the Moral March across the country."\n\nhttps://docs.google.com/document/d/199WYvLBMyNBcAkAsjncHnLyHPxPXDL93iunyHoTbjVs/edit

There were about 100 of us at that meeting as visitors. We were all pretty p.o.d by the end, and are taking that back to our districts and the state. \n\n
The demonstrations, marches and rallies ARE 'doing something'. They are getting and keeping people involved. They are keeping the pressure on, and increasing it. \n\nThey can lead to change, esp. in 2018 and 2020. \n\nOne of the big problems of 2016 was more people didn't vote than did for any candidate. \n\nThe rallies will help increase turnout.\n\nThe rallies are also having 'right now' effects, like the blowback against selling public lands caused the repubs to back off and drop it. \n
Haha yea.  I use it in my [[Yidris]] deck.  If I find [[Blood Mist]] and get to attack, it's almost guaranteed to be game over if the Engine is out.

Likely to get better responses here\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/Petloss/\n\nand/or here\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/petmemorial/\n\n
I wouldn't surprise her, not at this time. But telling her (stretching the truth just a bit) you're in the neighborhood and would like to see her shouldn't hurt. \n
The first weeks after my Beverly died I asked a jeweler if there was  any way I could 'memorialize' my ring.\n\nHe asked what our birthdays were - Me August 3rd, her's August 4th.\n\nHe said "Peridot - formed when two meteors collide and fall to earth as one." \n\n[That's what I did](http://imgur.com/xohUdl4).\n\nKeep on truckin' and Good Luck on your exam.\n
Needs an NSFW tag..also, this may be the wrong sub, lol.
Why would making more staples available to players in a format mean that the format is dying?  That doesn't seem like a well thought-out response to this release...
Neat, but his chin/mouth seem a little off, and his neck looks like he's got extra bones that shouldn't be there.  Otherwise, good job!  I like the hair!
The problem I have with it is that its impact is solely determined on your opponent's deck.  In the first few turns, yes it can be brutal to strip mine a fetch...but you have no idea if they have more lands in hand, or even mana rocks (prevalent in nearly all EDH decks).  At least it replaces itself, but on a land, you're better off just spending that mana to ramp yourself.\n\nCountering Planeswalker abilities is nice, but I think you're overestimating Bind's usefulness here.  If someone is about to ultimate a Planeswalker, you're likely already behind in the game, so it's not like Bind is going to put you ahead.  If you're countering a single activation, well...I hope it's a good one, because you wasted a card slot on it, and they're going to just reactivate next turn.  \n\nI'd personally use that card slot for something like [[Asceticism]] or [[City of Solitude]], but that's just, like, my opinion, man 😜\n\n
I'm sorry if this has come up elsewhere, but what *exactly* is the Steelbook?  Is it just a metal case for the game (similar to some BluRay releases for movies)?  A notebook of some sort?  I can't seem to find a description of it, just what it does and does not come in.
Yes, love.  We have Stockholm syndrome.
Our Magic friends had asked me if I was interested in DMing for them in Dungeons and Dragons, since they'd never played, and I'd mentioned how I used to play back in high school at the same time I was playing Magic.  I agreed, so we start buying books and setting everything up. \n\nCustom campaign, the party ends up in a town of Deep Gnomes, trying to figure out what's going on (and where they were, because I randomly dumped them there when they used a teleportation circle in a Drow outpost).  My son won't shut up about whether or not he can murder a few of the gnomes so he can put them in his bag to reanimate when he needs to.  "Saving them for later", he says....\n\nI said "no", but eventually they were forced into an encounter with a Mindflayer who had a mine full of dwarves/gnomes attacking the group.  They almost died and had to flee, but at some point, I guess he had killed a few and...stuffed their corpses in his bag.  Later on, they get into another fight with Driders, Drow, and some more mind-slaved dwarves/gnomes...and he legit throws these bodies on the floor and starts churning out undead to distract the monsters, lol.  \n\nAfter the fighting is done, even though the monsters got away with what they were there to accomplish, he asks me if he can chop off the Drider's torso to use it later.  "yea, but then you're just going to have an undead with no legs...how's it gonna get around?"\n\n* Son: "It'll crawl, and trip my enemies".\n* Me: "I think that's weird...but okay..."\n\nOh man...so I let him do it.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\nA few weeks later, they're still in the Underdark, but find a huge labyrinth underground.  He's mostly irrelevant during this time because he drank a Gaseous Form potion to avoid being stabbed by some kobolds, but when it finally wore off, he got to meet a Xorn that the party had to trade gems with to finish the labyrinth.  He says he needs to go to the bathroom in real life, so he goes...which is when I noticed my player's handbook was gone.  He comes out with a disappointed look on his face.\n\n* Me: "What's wrong, bud?  Poop turn green?"\n* Him: "No...I can't animate a dead Xorn"\n\nHe still wanted to kill it, though.\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThey get to the end of the labyrinth, and the Paladin and Rogue end up killing this Naga before Round 3 is done.  My son shows up late and immediately asks if he can skin it.  \n\n* Me: "Why would you want to skin it, you can't reanimate it.  It's not humanoid!"\n* Him: "Yea, but I can use it's skin as another bag to hold more corpses."\n* Me: "Dude, that's just fucking weird..."\n* Him: "Also, I can lay out it's bones in the shape of a human.  That's 'Humanoid', right?  I can give it extra arms, too!"\n* Me: :: dies inside, my son is a goddamned savage ::\n\n
> I'd tell that friend to just build better decks.\n\nSee, I would, but he doesn't have access to better cards.  It's at the point where I've been making foil proxies of staples like Sensei's Divining Top, Damnation, and Wurmcoil Engine to help push those without the resources (card availability and $$$) towards stronger decks.\n\n> if your friend can't accept this it's entirely possible he could even turn new players off the game entirely\n\nTrue, and I agree.  There's always either a rage scoop, a pile of salt, or vocal complaints, and he's the *only* person that does it.  Last night I mentioned that it's just a game.  When I lose, I take it in stride and never get pissed.  My kids and our other friends are the same.  Like if I'm playing [[Hanna, Ship's Navigator]] and another friend plays [[Aura Shards]], I don't auto-scoop and start yelling about it - I grin and hope I can find a removal, lol.  Not with this other friend, though...everything's personal, for some reason.  Deck choice doesn't really seem to matter...hell, even my [[Phelddagrif]] hugs deck got bitched at for winning (with [[The Great Aurora]], lol).  \n\nI've been playing for 18 years, so it makes sense that my sequencing and plays might be a bit better than his, but if I limit myself to a tiny selection of cards (comparitively speaking), I'm hoping it drives home the notion that it's not about having a powerful deck, but about playing and having fun.  That's my hope, at least.\n\n\n
> 3+ year player, content creator, community organizer -- and about to be permabanned. How can I stop this?\n\nDamn, that's unfortunate.\n\n> despite my ENOURMOUS commitment to the game, community involvement, and a squeaky clean record\n\n...seems like this person is *really* devoted to the game.  Not sure what community involvement is involved, but hey...hope he/she gets it fixed...\n\n> Greetings, from a dedicated player and community member\n\nOK, we get it...you're a "dedicated" player and community member (goes without saying, if you're even playing the game).  No more or less than the rest of us...\n\n> I suffer from GAD and ADHD with panic attacks\n\nOh, *for fuck's sake*, really?  \n\n\nLook, I hate that this happened to you, and I hope it gets fixed, but I have a minor complaint (not that it matters).  Why does every "help me!" have to revolve around shoving mental/emotional issues in everyone's face?  A sufficient cry for help would be enough, but *nooooo*, you have to literally pile on the "*see?  I'm flawed!  Help me!*" nonsense on top of that cry for help, which 1) makes you look silly, and 2) downplays the conditions.  \n\nLook, I suffer from anxiety and depression, and I even have ADHD, but have never used that shit as an excuse.  Only weaklings do that.  Don't be weak.  If a virtual beach in a video game (which I admit, looks and sounds nice) helps you better than other treatments prescribed from actual *doctors*, then you need to seek help *now* so that you don't shut down (emotionally) when you cannot play the game one day (servers go down, you lose your job and can't pay, or whatever).  Best of luck.  
Whenever I see the hiring page for TCGPlayer, I think "Man, I sure wish I could get the nerve up to apply and work there", but then the dreaded "am I good enough?" stuff creeps into my mind...15 years in the IT field, 10 as a domain administrator/network admin, 5 as a web developer...and I still second-guess myself.  \n\nThen I realize that, honestly, upending my wife and kids to move across the country (we live in AZ) to work as a web developer for a store that I absolutely love probably isn't going to be as dreamy as I think it is.  When I hear stories like this, though, it makes me *never* want to live in a large city.
Just a bit of rules questions here, but I thought we only get priority during the Upkeep step, and then during Main Phase 1 after the opponent passes (during the casting of a spell, or moving to the Combat Phase).  Is that right?  If so, the soonest possible time for you to sac Mindslicer would be after the priority pass in MP1, unless you did it during their Upkeep.\n\nI guess what I'm getting at is that you can't lock someone out of the game by recurring Mindslicer each turn - you put them in topdeck mode, so it's more of a "soft lock".  \n\nUnless I'm wrong, which I could be (and will apologize if I am).  I'm only a simple RA, lol
After my 8 year old son, his 11 year old sister, and our friends killed some deep gnomes at one point, so my son asked "*so since I'm a necromancer, can I skin the gnome that we killed and put him in my bag?  That way, I can reanimate him and he looks super scary.  Plus I can use the skin for something else.*"\n\nI said yes, but...started sleeping with the door locked at night.  \n
Going along with what /u/ExeuntTheDragon said, [resting cycles](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMh4ReJxeww) are hugely important to crafting your campaign and not having any one player (or combinations of players) turn your Big Bad Monsters into Slightly Glorified Cannon Fodder!  The host of that YouTube channel can ramble a bit, but this video in particular was immensely important in getting me to finally realize that I was "giving" too much when my players were like "can we do a long rest?  No?  What about three short rests?".\n\nThe second is to give your encounters some henchmen.  Think of it like this:  \n\n* *One* level 5 player versus a CR 5 monster is a **Deadly** encounter.\n* *Three* level 5 player versus a CR 5 monster is a **Medium** encounter\n* *Four* level 5 player versus a CR 5 monster is an **Easy** encounter.\n\nThe same idea works in reverse.  If you have a four-player party against a CR 9 monster, it's a deadly encounter.  However, it's still 4 vs 1, and crits happen.  However, if you add in two CR 5 monsters to the encounter, it's still Deadly, but they'll have to think more about how they're going to win.  Your control-oriented friend is going to be busy trying to either keep the CR5 monsters under wraps, or trying to slow down the CR9 so the party can deal with the two CR5s (which will be an **Easy** encounter for a party of four level 5s).  \n\nA single CR9 vs a party of level 5 players (the encounter described above) is going to award 1,250 XP each (5,000 XP budget).  Adding two CR5s to that mix puts the XP-per-player to 2,150 xp (a total of 8,600).  The most important thing, though, is being able to tweak your encounters.\n\nAre the additional CR5 monsters absolutely trouncing your party?  Reduce their damage rolls by 1 die (so if they roll 2d6+2 for damage, make it only do 1d6+1).  \n\nYou can also craft the environment to better situate the CR9 and put the party at disadvantage.  An example is what I did with my players at the end of my campaign:\n\n* They had to defeat an Illithid guarding a portal with a drow wizard (CR7).  They absolutely destroyed the wizard, so the Illithid took to the air and floated off into the cavern, attacking them at range.  They fought back, but eventually ran out of effective spells and ranged ammo. \n \n* One of the casters in the group asked if they could cast Enlarge on the Wizard's bat familiar.  I allowed it.  The paladin asked if she could ride it if she took off her breastplate.  I allowed it.\n\n* The paladin rode the bat to victory (I love saying that) by catching up to the Illithid, grabbing it, and physically punching the thing in it's squishy face until they ended up on the cavern floor.  That's where the rest of Team Murderhobo got to hack it to pieces and take its stuff.\n\nI honestly thought that they were going to lose that fight (end of the campaign, if I won, great!).  
It's listed on the main page for the set on the Mothership 
With most my playgroup, it's fine.  "Oh, InsidiousToilet did his InsidiousToilet thing again", we laugh, to go another game.  I have a handful of decks I rotate through, and usually let others choose what I play, so they at least know the gameplan (and because I lend them out when people come over).  Nicol Bolas should give people time enough to borrow my Meren, Yidris, or Yisan decks and start doing degenerate things...and if they don't...I get to fling dragons at them XD\n\nWe did have a 4 on 1 last year where everyone tried to take down my [[Hanna, Ship's Navigator]] deck.  They almost got me, too, until I managed to hit a tutor and start locking the board down, stealing everything they owned, and then beat them to death with it (put the Athreos player on tilt because of Aura Thief, lol).
I put a bunch of cheap card draw/mana/removal spells in and run with the [[Orbital Space Cannon]].  I use double-strike enchantments (and a few cantrips) to get the Cascade fun rolling, and every time I cast, [[Paradox Engine]] resets my mana rocks/dorks.  
Put the link as a comment.  Also, it doesn't go anywhere.
What sucks is, with no game shops nearby, the only way I could even get close to buying them at MSRP is at Walmart/Target...and they're never on the shelves.  I'm pretty sure there's someone in the back who knows what's up and buys them to sell online, lol.
Fixed ;-)  Explained up above why, was having two conversations at once, hah
My daughter isn't half-bad either.  Not as good as my son, but she won a giant cardboard cutout of one of the characters in a previous set (a lifesized copie of Archangel Avacyn from the Shadows Over Innistrad set.)
Just the general multi-color dorks:  [[Rattleclaw Mystic]], [[Birds of Paradise]], signets, talismans, [[Sol Ring]], and [[Mana Crypt]].  I think there may be a few more, but I don't have the deck on me to check at the moment.  Point is, you tap everything for mana, spend a blue to cast [[Preordain]], get to untap everything and then go for something else.  You only whiff if you draw lands, so I usually save those up and then [[Scroll Rack]] them away when I start drawing blanks.  If left unmolested, I can gain enough life to kill three players in one turn with the Reservoir, due to the Engine and (if I had it when I attacked) Double-Strike from [[Blood Mist]] (because it doubles the cascade triggers on each cast, meaning 1 spell = 2 more spells).  It can get pretty degenerate if no one has artifact removal and/or counterspells on the turn I go off.
Damn, he literally disarmed that crab at 2:00.  I wonder if these were just "feeding" crabs or what, seems a bit mismatched...friggin' murdershrimp, lol
I hate the fact that we share oxygen with these amoebas...
Grapples are life.  Disable an enemy, drag it around, beat it's ass.  Done.
Anything works, but I have two boxes that I store my Cube in that I'll share - one for using at home, and one for when I want to transport it somewhere.  Feel free to ask any questions if you've got 'em.\n\n##[Mox Cub3](http://a.co/fkjfhEs), by UltraPro\nI got this for $49 from my LGS before they closed down because it was sitting on a shelf for a year and never sold, and you can probably find them online for cheaper used.  It's *great*!  Tolarian Community College (someone can plug him if they want, I forget his username) did a [review](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uciXA2tQ-Gw) of it at one point, though after two years, I've never had the problems with mine that he did with his (and mine was beat up quite a bit, tumbling around in the car, being dropped, etc).  The only downside is that it's kind of a pain in the ass to haul around if you bring your Cube to other areas (LGS, friend's house, etc).  To solve that, I bought...\n\n\n##["Quiver"](http://amzn.com/B00XYC3MNI), by QuiverTime.  \n\nIt was $30 or so on Amazon when I bought it, and I wrote a review on it over /r/mtgcube ([here](https://www.reddit.com/r/mtgcube/comments/496u30/review_quivertimes_quiver_rating_a/)), complete with pictures and how I set it up (pro tip: use DragonShield sleeve boxes!), but I'll copy/paste it below for those that don't want to go clicking a bunch of links:\n\n> ###QuiverTime's "Quiver". Rating: A+!\n\n> OK, sure...no one knows who I am, and I've never reviewed another product for Cube before, but hey...I figured I'd share how awesome this thing was: [QuiverTime's "Quiver"](http://amzn.com/B00XYC3MNI).  Full honesty here, but I would have never known about this if it weren't for /u/badatcommander, so props to him or her for the recommendation!  \n\n> All in all, this thing has been amazing in the week that I've used it.  It holds my 360-card cube, where all cards are double-sleeved.  Now, I also have foil proxies in there, so others might be able to fit more cards in.\n\n> [Here's an album of the review](http://imgur.com/a/Mka4f), but I'll copy/paste it down below for those who don't want to follow the link.\n\n> ###[Overhead View](http://imgur.com/SUbjPAs)\n\n> I got mine from Amazon for about $40.  The whole thing is very nice looking.  The skin is PU leather, and feels very nice.  Plus, the shiny logo on the front adds a little "bling" to it.  The shoulder strap is just that, a shoulder strap, so...yea.  Easy to carry!  It's just smaller than the OGW Game Day playmat in width.\n\n> ###[Inside View](http://imgur.com/s4GTZhe)\n\n> There's a small mesh net that can hold life pads, pencils, and separators (more on that in a bit).  My cube is 360 cards, which I separate into 8 packs of 45 cards.\n\n> ###[Boosters](http://imgur.com/T3nFztP)\n\n> Each pack of 45 cards (there are 8) gets shuffled by players and split into 3 stacks of 15 (the "boosters).  While the Dragon Shield boxes take up more room than a divider in between each stack would take, it provides a nice way to sneak things into the box (free boosters, etc).  Sadly, by using the Dragon Shield boxes, the Quiver doesn't have enough room for my sleeved lands (50 of each Basic land).  I carry those in another bag.\n\n> ###[Spacers](http://imgur.com/Dry66eU) / [In use](http://imgur.com/LImpPpu)\n\n> The Quiver comes with these nifty spacers that get put up against the ends of the inside.  They stop cards from getting bent and warped while being jostled about.\n\n> ###[Dividers](http://imgur.com/sp6RFwu)\n\n> They also provide these awesome thick, plastic dividers.  There are only four, but I put them to good use in another small bag that I use to carry my lands in.\n\n> Anyway, I just thought I'd share.  If anyone has any questions, I'm happy to answer them (but am going to bed, so...in 8 hours or so).  \n\n
I had [[Waste Not]] in there, but decided that I wasn't running enough wheels to really make much use of it.  That, and (other than Kozilek) had no way to get things back from the grave if I hadn't found the Stronghold yet.
Oh, OK.  Thanks!
OK, last one, only because it's probably the most savage shit he's pulled so far.  Then I need to get back to work, lol...\n\nEveryone was sick, so I just made a random chart with CR-appropriate monsters for my daughter and son to fight one night.  I made a little foam terrain cave, painted it (made a lot of terrain after that, actually), and bought some minis for them to use.  They're going up against a Drow Wizard (CR 7) at level 9, which I figure was fine.  It was hiding at the other end of this cave, waiting for them to make their first move, when my son does this bullshit...\n\n* Son: "Dad, can we rest and memorize some different spells before the fight?"  \n* Me: "Sure, we're just fooling around.  What you do here doesn't impact our game, so...go for it".\n\nI go off to poop for a few mins, then come back.\n\n* Son: "I made some tea for us to drink, it's got mint in it, to keep us on our toes".\n* Me: "Oh, that's nice of you!  You guys might get thirsty in this fight!"\n* Daughter: "Hey, can I have some, brother?"\n\n---\n\n* Son: "Sure!" (waits for her to "pretend-drink")\n* Son: "Please roll a d20 and add your CON modifier"\n* Daughter: "Why?"\n* Son: "Just do it."\n* Me: "...."\n\n---\n\n* Daughter: "I got an 8.  What is this?"\n* Son: "You're now asleep.  I put a sleeping poison in the mint tea, which you couldn't taste because of all the extra mint".\n* Daughter: "...WHAT?  DAD, CAN HE DO THAT?  COME ON!"\n* Me: "Soooo...what's the point to all this, bud?"\n\n---\n\n* Son: "I take out my knife and stab her in the heart."\n* Daughter: (completely losing her shit right now)\n* Me: (speechless)\n* Son: "Is she dead?"\n* Me: "I'm gonna say that's a yes...I mean, it's a knife to the heart...not really sure hit points matter at this point..."\n\n---\n\n* Son: "Good.  She's an elf, so I'm going to put her in my bag for later."\n* Me: "You don't have enough room...there are still dead gnomes in there."\n* Son: (drags two gnome corpses out and reanimates them, puts sister's dead body into bag, slings it over his shoulder).\n* Me: .... (quietly wonders if this is the correct way to parent)\n* Daughter: (still losing her shit, runs off pissed to her room to go read books)\n\n---\n\nHe actually fought the Wizard that night, because he knew it used Cloudkill (or something similar, I forget) and knew that Undead were immune to it.  His basic strategy was to corner it once he found it, swarm it with his undead, and basically spent the fight slinging spells back and forth.  He eventually ended the fight by using his dragonborn ice breath on it, because dragons, lol\n\n\n\nI'd have more to share, but he and I are currently playing Kobold Bards in our friend's campaign...though he can still multiclass into Wizard....lol.
*Exactly!*
Well, MM1 is $400 a box.  But it also had a small print run, if I understand correctly
I'm confused why would usb 3 be a problem? Is it because the controller is usb 2?
If mine are any indication of what they'll do when left to their own devices, then it's probably natural that they gravitate towards things that their parents like:\n\nMe: I like gaming, music like Metallica and Avantasia, and I'm a computer programmer.\n\nWife: ikes cooking and whatever the newest Drama shows on Netflix are.\n\nKids: like gaming, cooking, drama shows, Metallica, Avantasia, and they want to learn how to program computers, lol.
I second what the person in the YouTube comments said: \n\n"*I hope that bitch gets hit by a school bus.﻿*"
> Gonti\n\nTrue, and I guess we have enough artifact ramp to repeatedly get him out, too.\n\n> Gitrog\n\nI have a Gitrog deck that kills with [[Ob Nixilis, the Fallen]] + [[Sudden Reclamation]] + [[Zuran Orb]].  People love it, until I kill them, but I don't imagine he's near as powerful with Standard-only cards.\n\n> Tazri\n\nShe seems like she could be really fun, but most of the allies seem a little underwhelming.  I was thinking [[Munda, Ambush Leader]] because he can at least get me more allies, but again, Boros is a little "bleh" right now.\n\nI'll see if I can't throw some Tazri together and playtest against my kids ;-)  \n\n
I've watched it, but like I said in my direct response to the OP, I've never had the problems that the professor had with his .  Mine's going on something like two years of having the hell beat out of it, and it's still in mostly-perfect condition (the corners are a little dented from being dropped and such).
One of the greatest things to happen to me, as a parent, is my children getting into gaming.  It's enriched our lives so much at this point...both kids are incredibly smart, they get along in nearly all social environments (probably from meeting and interacting with strangers at the shop before it closed), etc.  Hell, Magic taught them to think critically, plan ahead, and all that jazz, too.  
I hear ya, I check back every few months and....never have my size available for anything (hoodies, shirts...nothin').
Fast forward about 8 months, I decided he was probably good enough to go to a "real" tournament with the more competitive folks, so we went down to our small comic shop to sign up. He didn't win, but I let him play a control deck that (by most accounts) takes a lot of understanding to play (understanding the board state, what creatures/spells to ignore, and which ones to kill/counter, etc). He loved the deck, so I let him play it.\n\nHe sits down and gets paired with his first opponent: an Army soldier somewhere in his thirties. They shook hands, and the guy had that entertained look on his face like "look at this little guy, playing Magic with the adults!". I remember that look, because it faded 5 minutes into the game, when it went from "slightly entertained" to "....what the fuck is going on?". Rounds in Magic are "best 2 of 3", and my son won the first one. He went on to lose the second, and also lost the third game, but not before making the guy play it out for an hour, lol.\n\nUndeterred, my son got paired with my daughter next. He absolutely crushed her, she starts crying because he didn't let her play anything ("control deck", lol), so I spent $50 in cards/sleeves/snacks to calm her down and let her beat me in the next round. My son continues up the ladder, winning most of his matches. He got 8th place out of about 24 people, IIRC. I placed 15th and my daughter placed 16th.\n\nHe's in 2nd grade right now (8 years old) and has the highest grades of anyone in his grade level, if the last report I read was legit. I am immensely proud of my son, though he is an asshole.  He's also very good at Magic and wants to go to a Grand Prix, but we don't live anywhere near the cities that usually have them.  He gets to watch the major tournaments on YouTube and Twitch, though, so he's happy and gets to compete-by-proxy, I guess, lol. 
Thanks!  I know what you mean...that shit pisses me off.  I let my kids do what they want, as long as they aren't doing anything dangerous or bothering anyone.  Other than the occasional scolding, I haven't had to actually *punish* them in years.  \n\nBut hell, they're smart little gamers, so even if they acted up occasionally, I still wouldn't be that upset.  My daughter DM'd her first mini-campaign on her birthday earlier this month, and every single person there said they loved it.
I took the map and enlarged it in Photoshop, printed it out across 6 pages, and slowly revealed each part they could see.  Did the same thing with Wave Echo Cave, but used 12 pages.  Worked pretty well.
Nah, I was just responding to the question about my necromancer son who's obsessed with stuffing corpses into his bags.  We re-did the fight after (my daughter calmed down) with a Mindflayer in the same environment, daughter ended up using my son as bait, let him get face-grappled, and blew them both to bits.  My daughter is more refined, but not beyond getting revenge when she can.  I just sit back and let it play out, only moving in when the arguments/rivalry gets too out of hand.  Besides, I spread the love equally: my daughter even [got her own post](https://www.reddit.com/r/magicTCG/comments/4hqx8t/soi_game_day_daughter_went_30_pulled_an_avacyn/d2rmq79/) when she took down the "Shadows Over Innistrad" Game Day tournament back in April.
GP trials are not gone, they're just not being done in-store.  \n\n> GPTs will continue to be held **on-site on Fridays of Grand Prix before the main event** for players who wish to earn byes for that event. Players can also continue to earn byes in Grand Prix main events by hitting the yearly Planeswalker Points threshold, which can be found on the Grand Prix page.
> Your opponents deck should be tuned and full of good stuff\n\nNot in all play environments, though.  It's still a casual format that's less competitive than Standard (for the most part).  Most games I've been to were similar to what "kitchen table magic" was for me in the 1990s.  Are there competitive groups with tuned decks?  Hell yea, and I've got those, but not all groups are going to be like that.  I feel that Bind's usefulness goes up as the competitiveness of your opponents' decks increases.  \n\nIf it works for you, though, definitely run it.  I have a copy in my Yisan deck because, if it's in my opening hand, I can usually do something neat with it at some point...but I never plan on drawing it because games with Yisan should end on turns 6-8 (average) in 1v1 and 10-15 in 4-FFA (taking board wipes into account, lol).
This is just my opinion, but if you want people to actually *use* it (and therefore "catch on"), you need to make it clear what the goal of the site is.  Right now it suffers from the "looks pretty; does nothing" problem.  
> according to the guy streaming the deck\n\n"The guy"...  Isn't this cat (pun intended) part of your "team", Brandon?  I mean, he isn't very good (at least, not with this deck), and it was embarrassing to watch.  I'm not sure this is what you want to start posting if you're looking to get more subs for the channel, lol.  \n
Are you sure that information is correct?  Based on the announcement on the [mothership](http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/news/return-nationals-and-changes-grand-prix-2017-02-09), this is what I got from it:\n\n* Grand Prix Trials in local stores are ending after GP Vegas.\n* Grand Prix Trials will be on-site at GPs before the main event.\n* Grand Prix byes can still be earned with Planeswalker Points.\n\nMeaning that there are still GPTs,  just not at stores.  That does not signal the death of competitive modern.
Yea, kind of.  It's interactions, or when he gets screwed on lands and/or playables.\n\n> DBing\n\nWhat does this term mean?  I just woke up and haven't had coffee yet, but...brain scan is coming up with zero results, lol.
> does nothing but annoy the opponent. \n\nPer the title, my kid is an asshole.  He started playing when he was 5 years old, he's currently 8, and he can (and does) trounce people at FNM and EDH/Cube nights when we have people over to our house.  Hell, the little bastard plays Slivers in EDH, for crying out loud.  Annoying the opponent is *all* he wants to do, heh
You need something to bounce Rishkar in order to actually have it work like Ascendancy, right?
Oh, I put them in the side while I try to fix it up a bit.  The double-green wasn't really working with the amount of forests/mountains in the deck (probably need to up the green a bit).  It just seems like, if they get a creature out, I get slammed while blowing up lands and have no real way to deal with it.  \n\nI thought about adding black for things like Murder and Mind Rot, but wasn't sure the black splash was worth it.  What do you think?
Hell yea, I have a Zada EDH storm deck that doubles as goblin swarm and it's hilarious fun, lol.  I don't play it near as often as I should, but I didn't even think to put Kari Zev's Expertise into it.
Does this qualify?  My friends always make me welcome new players in our group with this in my Group Hugs deck ([[Phelddagrif]]).\n\n* [[Selvala, Explorer Returned]] + [[Intruder Alarm]] + [[Phelddagrif]] in play (or use [[Alchemist's Refuge]] to flash some/all of them in before your turn starts).  \n* Cast [[The Great Aurora]]. \n* With Aurora on the stack, Selvala for G mana to feed Phelddagriff, donating a Hippo to an opponent.  Repeat as necessary.\n* Let Aurora resolve.\n* Mill out the table.\n\n*Explanation*\n\n* For milling in paper, you just make 100 tokens and GG.  In MTGO, you have to do a little math, but it's not hard: (Library + Hand + Permanents) - (Hand + Permanents) + 1 = Tokens to produce. \n* **Example**: 60 cards in library, 5 cards in hand, 10 permanents in play.  Aurora will have them draw 15 (cards + perms) after shuffling it all together (75 total in library at that point).  So 75 - 15 + 1 = 61.  Make 61 tokens.  Now instead of drawing 15 cards when Aurora resolves, they draw 76, decking themselves by 1 card.
Well, that's what you get when you decide to get snipped.  I mean, unless she picked you up and put you on that table herself, in which case you're a little bitch ;-) 
Still in the process of cutting cards out of the list before I sleeve it up though...14 to go!  How's the BR Sarkhan in that deck?  How often does he end up killing himself from a dragon?  I don't like Dragonspeaker, so I was thinking of throwing in [[Chandra, Flamecaller]] for the repeatable self-wheel/draw and the token-nuking.  
Do you want bumblebee murderbots?  Because that's how you get bumblebee murderbots. (*Black Mirror Season 4 reference*).
Haha, he wouldn't know what to do with one.  I mean, I imagine that he'd hold his heals hostage in order to get what he wanted out of people...he's pretty sneaky like that.\n\n
[here](http://tappedout.net/mtg-decks/13-02-17-biP-nicol-bolas-edh/) it is right now.  Still need to make some cuts.  It's mostly copying/stealing creatures until the late game when I can get the dragons out to do mean things ;-) 
I am, but I have to intentionally nerf his decks when our friends play.  If I don't do that, it's nothing but "infinite turns" and other jank-ass shit that no one (except me) is willing to play against, lol.\n\nThat said, I nerf my decks too, because not everyone has access to the older cards I do (and some of them are expensive as hell, too).  \n\nBut yea, I figure whenever I get enough money to blow on an expensive deck he wants to build (after he playtests with proxies at home, of course), we'll take a 9 hour drive over to where the nearest Grand Prix is and let him go wallop a few people, lol.\n\n
Noyan Dar seems *really* spicy, and I've played him before in a Jeskai Ascendancy deck in Standard that did jank things with lands...but my problem in EDH, I think, would be when someone board wipes or targets my lands with removal...might be kind of hard to play the game when my lands are all in the graveyard ([[Splendid reclamation]] time, maybe?  haha).
Trump steaks, right?  Lol
some of us don't have local shops.
#makepostsoriginalagain 
Thanks ;-)  Yea, it was a Blue/Black deck back in KTK-DTK era.  I got in touch with [Ryan Yee](http://ryanyee.com/) and got copies of Silumgar's Scorn and Dig Through Time signed (seems like a really nice guy), and so it was pretty rad to play with that deck (for all three of us).  \n\nWe still play Magic, but mostly EDH these days.  There's really not a whole lot of areas to play Standard here in town, and Modern only lived for a short while (I was on GR Tron, daughter played 8-Rack without the Lilianas, and my son played UG Infect).  \n\nLast time we played Standard was towards the Eldritch Moon prerelease.  My daughter ended up [going 3-0 at Game Day for SOI](https://www.reddit.com/r/magicTCG/comments/4hqx8t/soi_game_day_daughter_went_30_pulled_an_avacyn/d2rmq79/) and won the giant cardboard Avacyn, which still sits in her room (the second photo in that post is the evil necro son, lol).  If you're familiar with it, she played Luis Scott Vargas' list from the Pro Tour SOI, but changed a few things around.  She *really* liked that deck.\n\n\nWith EDH, I just finished Yidris and decided to build a Nicol Bolas deck because my daughter and I are really excited for his supposed appearance in Amonkhet.  My son is playing the Kynaios and Tiro deck that recently came out, but he's got Sliver Hivelord and Ezuri Claw of Progress.  My daughter and I took my Sydri deck, tore it apart, and added all the good bits to her new Breya deck last week, so we're all trying out new decks whenever I'm at home (usually working pretty late on the weeknights).\n
Nah, he doesn't suck, he just has a hard time realizing that Magic is highly susceptible to "bad luck", both in draws and being outplayed.
That's awesome!  I'm actually building a Nicol Bolas deck right now (my kids and I are hyped for *Amonkhet* & *Hour of Devestation* sets coming up), and I was just about to post my decklist to ask for help making some cuts, haha.\n\nIs your deck up on CMDRDecks?  I feel like I've seen this near-exact list before.  Any comments on how it plays out against other types of decks?  
I thought I was the only one who did this kind of stuff, hahaha.  Now I know that, at least if I *am* insane, that insanity is not unique to me!  :: runs off cackling in the Karplusan Forest :: 
Whoops, you got me there!  My son (who is 8) was talking to me about building a deck like this, while my daughter (who is 10) was talking to me about R.A. Salvatore books and which one comes after the one she's on ("Servant of the Shard"), lol.  A bit addle-brained, but I fixed it ;-) 
I used Expertise (as a gamer) to up my Parenting skill.  Performing...not so much, lol.
Haha thanks
I'm going to post an updated list soon, but Sin Prodder has been giving sooooo much value lately in the current version ;-) 
Oh wow, I misread that -4...that's pretty damned awesome!
Ahh, gotcha.  I was thinking of maybe using [[Erratic Portal]] to bounce Rishkar and go bonkers with the mana, hahaha
Go to MTGGoldfish and search the Standard metagame for "Energy Fog".  That's pretty much the deck you're trying to build.  Swap in anything from AER that you think might help you in certain matchups (keeping in mind that FNM is likely going to have a lot of Jeskai copycat and Mardu vehicles running around).
If you find this disgusting, you probably don't cope well with the numerous other things going on in life right now.  
I feel you :(  2/28/2015 for me.  It's always a hard date.
If I did Baral, I could guarantee that the deck would get lit on fire after my 3rd counterspell, hahahaha.  But Sram does seem really good, especially with the card advantage he provides.
> also why the top bar needs to move so much? \n\nIndeed, this is quite annoying.  It's like the old <marquee> tag from HTML 2 (or whichever version it was...I'm glad it's dead), but with set symbols, lol.
Meanwhile, they forget that a substantial number of actresses in the porn industry are imported from that region...lol.
I don't know who Gopher is (or why you're getting downvoted), but yea, RIP Gopher.\n\nMy shop closed down last year.  We've got another about 20 minutes away, but they have zero stock and it's mostly just a wargaming community, albeit very small.
I love him, but yea, you're not wrong.  I think of this as a way to drive home the point that it's not about the cards, it's about how you play.  
I have a 100% Yisan deck, but it only comes out when people ask me to show it off, because throwing Craterhoofs at people's faces is fun as long as it's not your face ;-)  \n\nBut most of our decks are in the $100-$300 range, with the exception of some pricey cards that I move around from deck to deck occasionally (FoW, Mana Crypt, etc).
It's pretty funny, because when I'm at work and the kids have nothing to do (mom won't let them play games on the PS4, etc), they each grab the books and "study".  My son likes to read Volo's Guide, and my daughter likes to read the Monster Manual, lol
dn't forget it's partner in crime, [[Treasure Cruise]]
Thanks!
* Wife threatens to divorce me?  No tears.  \n* Three family members get cancer?  I worry, but no tears.  \n* A dog in distress?  I break down like someone just murdered my family.\n\nThe last time I cried was when a woman posted on a local FB page for lost pets, asking for help to get her elderly dog to the vet.  She had no car, didn't have money for a taxi, and the pupper was having seizures and couldn't move.  It was 6pm at night, I was still at work and couldn't leave, but sat there following the post for an hour and thirty minutes.\n\nEventually, a local taxi driver had gotten in touch with them and given them all a ride to the local vet.  Euthanasia was the only option available to ease the poor pupper's suffering, but the bill ended up being near $300.  It's been nearly two years since I had to put my pupper down, so I called the vet anonymously and paid their bill over the phone, then sat there at my desk and cried for a while.\n\n
Lol, OK.  Here goes, this is where it all started (little long, but I'm bored, so...sorry not sorry, heh):\n\nI used to play Magic: the Gathering, from 1993-2002, when I joined the military and went off to see the world (ended up living in Japan for 10 years, so it worked out for me).  2014 rolls along and my adventurous 5 year old and genius-level smartass 7 year old half-Japanese kids discover my old Magic cards in the garage.  They start asking about them, but I'm too lazy (and scared) to pull them out, so I just explain it away with "I'll teach you when you get older, after you learn to read".  However, we moved a few months later, and they found the cards again, so...\n\n* **Monday**: I let them grab a few decks and I taught them the basics of how a turn works.\n* **Tuesday**: I came home really late, so they were already in bed, but the cards were on the kitchen table and my wife said they were trying to play.\n* **Wednesday**: Worked late again, the cards were on the table again, but this time there were creatures, tapped lands, etc.\n* **Thursday**: I came home about 30 mins after they went to bed.  Snuck in to give them a kiss goodnight...caught my daughter with an old instruction manual and a flashlight...\n\n**Friday** shows up, the kids said that they saw people playing Magic at the local Hastings a few weeks ago, so they want to go check it out.  So we went to check it out...the kids had fun, but I was mostly paying attention to the rules and trying to get caught up on everything, now that this is "probably gonna be a thing for them".  Everyone said the kids did pretty well, and after we went home, the kids were still going on about how fun it was.  Their first Friday Night Magic!\n\nSo on **Saturday**, my son asks if he and I can play.  I ask if he needs me to read the cards for him, and he pipes out a "Why?  You're gonna cheat!  I know what they do!".\n\n*"Oooookay, Mr. Badass"*\n\nIt was a goddamned *bloodbath*.\n\nTurns out, my son had memorized what the cards did by asking people to read it to him, and he'd remember the card art.  I didn't know kids could do that, but do it he did, and he was damned good at it.  So we started going to Friday Night Magic at the local Hastings regularly after that point.  He started getting better, and by the time he started school, he was already reading, because he learned how to do it while playing Magic.\n
Just hitting the site's front page, there is no indication of *what* the app does.  As a web developer myself, that's a big no-no.  Sure, you've got a "sign in" link off towards the right, but that's not where the user's focus immediately gets drawn, and they still don't know *why* they should be signing in.
I did this when she came out... My third night playing her, everyone had spot removal for her so I never got to go off, lol
Don't be a whiny bitch. Your friend did the same exact thing you admit to doing.  There's nothing wrong there.
I hear you on the wallet issue for sure, the masterpieces I have from this block hurt quite a bit, lol.\n\nOur meta is actually pretty slow, mostly because it's friends (who don't have a lot of resources to acquire cards) and my kids (building good decks for three people is *expensive*, but the kids get a kick out of beating us adults up).  I figured I'd go for something relatively slow that could win if left unchecked, because as it stands now, I rarely lose and it's a bit boring (I'm usually the one playing counterspells or strong synergistic card pairs).\n\n
Does anyone actually play his brews for more than a few matches?  Some of them seem like they could have some traction for the budget ones, but the others just seem silly (like the Cryptolith Bestiary Green deck he made a few weeks ago).  
True!  I was fiddling around with a GR Land Destruction deck, but last night ended up testing a UR one.  Barral performed great (T2 Barral, T3 Crumble/Distortion), because land destruction in Standard is normally a turn 4 deal (T3 with dorks).  I've found that if the dorks die, though, the game turns to crap.  With UR, I've been able to counter most removal spells while casually blowing up artifacts and lands with abandon, hahaha.  But I'm totally down to try a mono-blue deck that's just control.
I want to play Mass Effect: Andromeda, but I can't play FPS games on my children's PS4 (I suck at using the joystick knobs to aim).  Ideally, I'd like to run it on Medium-High graphics, but not "max", as that requires more upgrades.\n\n[My current build](https://pcpartpicker.com/list/MD9RRG) running a [Gigabyte GA-Z97-HD3](https://pcpartpicker.com/product/KTdqqs/gigabyte-motherboard-gaz97hd3) motherboard and [Asus Radeon HD 7850](https://pcpartpicker.com/product/NVNp99/asus-video-card-hd7850dc22gd5) video card meets minimum requirements but falls into the 54th percentile for "Recommended" specs on SystemRequirementsLab's analysis.  I also run three monitors using EyeFinity (DVI, mini-DP, and HDMI).  \n\nWith a budget of about $250-350, could anyone make some recommendations for a video card upgrade?  I'm completely lost when looking at the 31 pages of compatible cards on PCPartPicker.    \n\nThanks in advance, fellow Redditors
> I want to play this game.\n\nDungeons and Dragons!\n\n \n> Keep up the updated!\n\nHaha, since everyone likes it, maybe I'll make some posts once in a while with the shenanigans they do during our campaigns on Saturday nights ;-) \n\n> How can I sign up for updates notifications? xD\n\nI'm not sure how it works on Reddit.  Maybe add me as a Friend?  I think my posts will show up as green text when you look at the sub, but...not really sure how it works.\n\nThanks!\n\n
You sure about that?  I lived in Japan for quite a while and there was plenty of casual to go around.  Then again, my experience is anecdotal.
That's awesome ;-)  Thanks!
You stepped in a discussion with all of the knowledge from the comment chain above. Then don't get all soft-toed on me when somebody holds it in front of you when you make a bad argument.
I wasn't aware, thanks
I've got one, and the only downside is how much of a pain in the ass it is to move it around when you want to transport it somewhere.  Other than that, it looks fucking great, and I highly recommend it as long as you're paying < $50 for it.  It's overpriced, but it's not exactly "garbage"...there's far more products out there that deserve that moniker.  
Someone sounds salty...but it's probably for the best.
I had just moved to Japan and could barely read katakana at the time when the first Transformers movie had come out.  I thought it was still in theaters in America, so you can imagine my surprise when I see Transmorphers on the shelves as a DVD.  I snatched it up, bought drinks and popcorn, sat down to watch it...and nearly cried.\n\nFucking Asylum flicks, man (>.<)
I'm not a PHP guy, but have you tried starting from the bare minimum, to learn the things you're referring to here?  It sounds like useful stuff that every PHP developer should know, so with that in mind, you'd think a good book or comprehensive tutorial would cover it.\n\nI do understand where you're coming from though.  I started as a systems administrator, turned into a Microsoft SharePoint slave, got frustrated with not understanding how things worked...so I taught myself C#, ASP.Net, SQL...none of which was anything like the early games I used to write in my teens and early 20s.  Add that to the fact that SharePoint has its tendrils in literally every other Microsoft product, and it felt like it would take an eternity to learn.  I eventually settled on an entry level web developer gig, learned MVC 4, and have been doing that for the past 5 years (promoted to Web Engineer IV recently, too).\n\nStick with it!
Zendikar Resurgent is not necessary in this deck, so that would be easy cut.
Understood ;-)  Yea, it's just a part of the game.  Hell, you can even see pros get screwed at major tournaments - happens to everyone.
I advise posting this on the republican sub too, to get a more evened out  answer.
Ah, sorry then.
I have
Yes, but independents and democrats do not. And since they make up a significant part of the population, it would be wise to take their concerns into account. Otherwise we end up on a merry-go-round, where every next legislation tries to undo that of the previous one.  The two parties will have to start working for the entirety of the American people and agree on compromises in the future, or they are doomed to squabble and accomplish nothing except piss people off and turn them away from politics into the arms of certain demagogues.
That's a pretty ammonoid
The polls weren't that terribly off, but the pollers got cocky and made assumptions that they shouldn't have. There's a great piece by fivethirtyeight about it if you're interested. Anyways, I think most of them learned a good lesson that day.
They don't, but urchins have those exact markings along their aboral surface. The 5-star symmetry is one of the reasons sea urchins and starfish are related.
Woosh?
I'll take that as  a compliment I guess. All of congress has a contributing factor. The fact that Obama tries to compromise is not only aimed at trying to convince republican members to do the sane thing (which they didn't, they turned petty during his entire tenure), but also towards the democractic members that often have some stakes (for example large insurance players in their state that lobby etc) on his side. And I don't understand what you mean by (30) and (31).\n\nAnd tbh, up until now I have heard of exactly one occurence of Obama remembering the republican side of his victory. I bet you I can find multiple examples of the current administration doing just that.\n\nAlso, if other countries around the globe are not going bankrupt from 'free healthcare', how would america, the nation with one of the largest GDPs in the world, ever go bankrupt? This is an argument not based on facts.
Care to elaborate? Do you believe every protest is intrinsically violent? Or just these ones?
Leuven is a bit expensive, yes. But I don't think you'll find any cheaper in Brussels. And the students are not the only people in Leuven, although they make up a majority probably. It's also a very quiet city in the summer :p
That's not the point. The point is that, in the past, many Trump supporters/alt-righters/whatever have continuously ignored calls for making generalisations, but when the perpetrator is "one of theirs", they start making the exact same reasoning. We aren't calling all Trump supporters violent mass murderers, we're calling out the hypocricy of their past actions compared to their present ones. Need I remind you of the countless posts on t_d right after the attack stating "surprisesurprise it's a muslim"?
Well, it's either that or the right wing American politicians lie more than the left wing. I don't doubt politifacts is (slightly) to the left of America's political compass, but that doesn't necessarily mean they are biased, sometimes the truth just isnt exactly in the middle.
I wonder how you call a turkey in hindi
That's funny, I literally finished building this deck two days ago. You can find the decklist [here](http://www.mtgvault.com/zalbaag/decks/marchesa-edh-thieves-rogues-2/). It was initially a dimir clone-steal deck piloted by [[Lazav]] but I really wanted to add some red cards. I wanted to run [[Gwendlyn di Corci]] at first, but her availability and price made me reconsider and I've since shifted towards [[marchesa the black rose]]. The flavor is only a tad off and she can support the rogue theme quite well.  \n\nSmall disclaimer: I've only played one real game with the deck so far, so some cards might not be ideal or be situational depending on your playgroup. It's also not the best way to build marchesa, flavor trumps strength in most cases.\n\nSome of the cards that I've been able to test so far and turned out great are [[Sygg, river cutthroat]], [[nekrataal]], [[Ink-eyes, servant of oni]] and [[silent-blade oni]]. The last two I ported from my Lazav deck and can really run away with games. Other must haves are [[Thassa, god of the sea]], [[marchesa's smuggler]], [[invisible stalker]] etc, and some good equipments like [[Quietus Spike]], [[Sword of Vengeance]] and [[Sword of the Animist]].\n\nThere is also a slight "pillow fort" or punisher theme going on in [[propaganda]], [[no mercy]], [[Crawlspace]] etc (currently considering [[hissing miasma]] as well). I put in these and a bunch of "gotcha" instants like [[illusionist's gambit]] and [[insidious will]] to keep opponents on their toes and discourage attacking us, since we are primarily aggro-based and would suffer in the end game without some protection.\n\nI think /u/jakebadlands 's choice of Sygg is also pretty nice. You lose R but gain a steady stream of cards instead. If you are committed to grixis though, I think marchesa's is ideal for you.
Ah, I was unaware. Apologies.
Fair enough, then we'd probably be better of leaving it as it is.
As soon as I read "Kundig" I started looking for the industrial flywheel. Wasn't where I expected it though.
It's a possibility, but I don't think he can pull it off.
Glad you figured that out. Now why are you talking to me again? Oh right, imaginary dead people.
Truth is we don't really know his exact net worth.
I'm not going to argue any further now, since that would be coming close to being disrespectful towards this sub. But just think about how he won and on what platform he won. Have a good day!
Then don't talk shit about stuff you don't know.
No problem! Tbh I was.surprised myself that I could find so much so fast.
Bye!
Disclaimer: I'm a European moderate, so I'd probably register as a leftie.\n\nI'm here because I have an interest in american politics, that means both sides of the political discourse. I can read plenty of democrat stuff on reddit and elsewhere but finding a good republican sub is a bit harder. So far I really enjoy this sub for it's level-headedness. I always try to stick to the sub rules and even stop discussing topics with someone if I feel I'm getting too close to something too controversial. I hope it's ok for you guys that I hang out here, as it's one of the only channels I can use to gain some insight into republican views.
Macron is a centrist. Contrary to the US, the European countries have more than two political parties.
And this is a serious subreddit.
I recommend /r/NeutralPolitics for unbiased opinions, facts and discussions on politics. Heavily moderated, but the good kind, kind of like AskHistorians. Especially [the thread here](https://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/comments/5qu5ho/whats_the_difference_between_trumps_travel_ban/) was very enlightening for me.
All three of them would at least partially be conscious of the fact that a photo op was involved, but that doesn't diminish the fact that it is a good thing to do. It gives a clear signal that this kind of things cannot pass. Regardless of what anybody thinks of Pence, this was a good thing to do.
Well, the description of the Aquia fm. notes that the calcareous layers may vary from well-cemented to 'friable', which I assume is what you have now (I have no idea what friable means but I dont think I can throw it in a frying pan). The shells may be colored by the soft sediment, not really sure.
Some of it does. Others try to compare data that is incomparable, such as unemployment in general and unemployed in subsets of the population.
Welcome to the club!
For* some it might be. I'm thinking especially of some people here on reddit (both anti- and pro-) that lock themselves up inside their own reasoning who would benefit from reading and thinking about someone else's opinion without shutting all over it.
Aah Volrath, the man with the best one liners in the history of magic.
>muh libtards hurr\n\nNice. Great reasoning here. Keep distracting, obviously worked great in the past.\n\nAnyways, you're still missing the point. The point is not that Donnie or Barry like to play golf for reasons of X and Y. It's that Donnie and his crew like to unironically point out that Barry "sure does like to play golf a lot" but get their panties in a bunch when we post a picture of Donnie golfing and make fun of it.
Or the other option is that there is actually something to worry about and those republicans are standing up for what they believe is the right thing. Especially concerning the picks by the senate. Since senate is firmly in Republican hands, they should have no problem fasttracking a republican president's candidates. The fact that they aren't is at least a bit concerning.
Depends on where he leaves and what angle he travels in, maybe.
Did they mistake astrology for astronomy? Because that sounds a whole lot more reasonable. Still a stupid mistake to make though.
Sol Ring ramps, reliquary tower does not. Unless your deck is geared towards drawing insane numbers of cards, you will lose out on colours. That said the effect gets worse the more colours you run, and it's almost negligible in mono coloured decks.
You know, I don't remember that quote. Maybe because I was too young at the time. Could you provide some sort of source? I'm interested to hear the context.
Oo you got bad-mouthed on the internet, I must be a fascist then. \n\nIf you want to step into a discussion with an argument, be prepared to answer questions about that specific argument. Or be prepared to deal with people that tackle it.
Is there any way we could, like, do a poll or something? Or have we done that already some time in the past?
Hey, I linked the exact same comment in the /r/republicans sub!
What you're saying doesn't make any sense. You think somali people fly to the US exclusively from somalian airports? Or do you want to bomb European airports?
That sounds like an overgeneralisation, don't you think?
Since this is now happening, do you feel disappointed?
If you think you can fit the entire health reform of a nation such as the US into a booklet of 50 pages, you are going to have a bad time. The reality of the situation is that comprehensive reforms such as this will *always* involve a lot of paperwork, in order to keep all parties involved marginally happy. And if congress then decides they shouldn't read it because it's a lot of work, well that's on them. All it brought them was the still continuing discussion on how to repeal something the *know* they shouldn't.\n\nReforming healthcare in your country is the biggest issue you face. Not terrorism, drugs, immigration or any of that shit. Tens of thousands of american citizens have died or have been pushed into poverty because they had the bad luck to get sick. So in my humble opinion, Oboma did try to change things, in small steps, towards improved health for all americans.
Another good place for discussion is /r/NeutralPolitics!
Um, no. My point was that the slander campaign was ineffective. There was definitely no lack of trying though. What have they come up with, unfounded claims about him being gay? Don't make me laugh. Besides, "the media" and "the government" would have loved Fillon if he wasn't damaged goods, he would have destroyed Le Pen in the first round.
It's a sign that a) there is nothing there or b) Trump isn't worried it coming out or damaging him. The Russian spy theory is a bit grotesque, but you can't say that there is nothing happening between Russia and the Trump administration/campaign team.
Suuure buddy *pats on back but secretly rolls eyes and twirls finger at forehead*
You have to be a bit careful as to how you word your arguments. For example, don't go in there blabbing about 'muslim ban' and how it's a bad thing etc. Go in and question the Trump administration's handeling of this case and how it's a PR disaster and you will see many people agree though.\n\nEdit: nvm, I went through your history (sorry) but I coun't find anything that would be considered anti-republican per se. Have you tried PMing them?
Which truth? As far as I'm aware, the entire slander campaign towards Macron has failed to result in any real dirt. The only candidates that were tarnished in the last couple of months are Fillon (scandal with wife and payments) and Le Pen (russian money stating Crimea is russian), both of them right-leaning. Your entire post was aimed at "the left" (even if Macron isn't leftist), yet I have yet to see any scandals on "their side". The only side I see getting butthurt is the right side.
Thanks for the decklist OP, I've been working on a budget list for a while, this gives me some ideas!
Welcome to the club! Don't forget your sources!
The left is as responsible for the partisan divide as the right is, and you will need both to bridge the gap. The GOP is in the perfect spot to start this process: the party won a landslide victory, they hold all the cards in hand. They could be the better man and make serious progress in bringing everyone closer, as the majority of US citizens want. Instead, all I have seen from the Trump administration so far is more attempts at division.
I agree. I'm not a fan of Trump, but I believe that, regardless of the fact that you're pro or against this ban, it's been a pretty poor execution. He could have avoided a lot of the critique if he planned this better in advance instead of doing it so haphazardly and letting the media run away with the narrative.
White supremacism is an ideology. Both sides are able to commit violence. Both sides can have extreme militant fractions. Many examples on both sides exist. Violence at events can be perpetrated by people unrelated to the cause they represent.
It's actually often referred to as 'whataboutism' and it's an old Soviet propaganda trick. Talk about irony.
Finger pointing will solve nothing.
Sooo natural crises are the only crises during which the president can not play golf. Got it.
Agreed. I am something of a left-leaner considered by American standards, but I've found the people over at /r/republican to be very open to a discussion, as long as you don't go on a rant and be respectful.
And your main argument for that is what, one event? I'm fine with you arguing the point, but if you're arguing about *facts*, you should be able to provide *proof*. Because in my eyes, you are cherrypicking just as much as everybody else on "the other side".\n\nEdit (forgot a bit): 'are able to' and 'can have' are not used hypothetically in this context. If you want to be pendantic about it, both sides *have* committed violence and both side *have extremist fringe groups*. Hope that's cleared up now.
Exactly: we have to treat all fossils we find as additional evidence for the theory of evolution, and the lack of certain fossils not as a lack of evidence in general.
The supreme court is supposed to be boring. If you want excitement, watch game of thrones.
And you still believe in imaginary dead people. So we're still at the exact same spot as two comments ago, only you've wasted some time.
Not everything is a conspiracy.
I linked to a thread from the /r/republicans page, but I don't think that could cause such a spike.
He should aim to make the lives of American citizens better. Ideally that goes hand in hand with winning elections.
all these shisty jokes are really bugging the coprolite out of me.
Well, I agree actually. However, pointing out the hypocrisy can serve a purpose, regardless of the fact that it's propagandistic in nature.  Just because a statement has an ulterior motive doesn't mean it can't be objectively true. This goes for all sides of the political spectrum of course.
Then head over to /r/neutralpolitics for some askhistorians-style modding.
If you want a truly unbiased opinion, check out /r/neutralpolitics.
Eh, I agree on the bolas part, but he's just so damn splashy. Plus, the deck isnt supposed to be *that* strong, so I'm fine with it
Yeah too bad. Have a nice day!
Screw it, put the ability in rogues and make a grixis commander. I need my rogue stealy-stabby tribal deck dammit.
dangit, that's true. Totally forgot about that.
This isn't really a poll in any way: nothing is measured, the outcome is an article based on the writers experience and quotes by people. So why it might be a good idea to include such questions, it's not really necessary. For all we know the author might have even asked those questions but chose not to present them here.
I looked into the two-round voting system again and you were right, there were some things I wasn't aware of. However I do stand by the point that the media would have a better relationship with Fillon than Le Pen.
You're right, you don't just throw away something like that.
Ah really? Thanks for letting me know, I'll edit my post accordingly.
Everyone being who exactly? Also, who said that I'm an american? Or a liberal for that matter? The reason you can't get shit done in america is because you don't really listen to the other side, forcing them to yell ever louder. I'll admit I'm guilty of this too from time to time.
Actually, if climate is similar to that in the Permian, I don't think there would be northern polar ice caps, only southern.
Europe homogeneous? You must not have been there for a couple of decades then. As a European I can safely tell you we haven't been overrun by the 'muslim horde' yet.
Can't be blocked is in UB, although this card can work in mono U too.
An additional factor might be that the rows of dirt on the left are very typical for asparagus, which is grown a lot in the fields of Belgium/Netherlands etc. Also the Facebook post mentioned above is from a Dutch/Belgian sounding name.
He lost some in my eyes too, but he gained a lot when he came out and admitted it, and explained exactly why. Remember that FTE was one of the only ones that gave Trump a reasonable chance, and they did that based on incomplete data. So in my eyes, they're fine for now.
Agreed. Crappy houses? Check. Gray-ish sky? Check. Economybook in dutch? Check.
Or maybe the guy is just well-liked? Not everything is a media conspiracy.\n
Wild asparagus tend to be green (as normal plants are), but 'professionally grown' asparagus is white, because the original shoots are kept away from the light after they sprout. The dirt with which they are covered is smoothened at the top so farmers can see clearly when they breach the surface IIRC. So either the guy is talking about the field on the right or he's using it figuratively.  Also, the man is apparently from a Dutch town, so I'm going for the Netherlands.
Yeah well I'm not going to actively underine my own arguments, that would be silly. I understand the counterpoints towards mandatory enrollement, but the truth is that this is not a problem inherent to mandatory insurance, because it works fine in other countries. It's a sign that somewhere along the chain somebody is fattening their purse at the cost of the people. However, mandatory enrollement is a necessity if you want your system to work: enough people need to contribute to make it worthwile for the sick ones.\n\nSo instead of blaming the system that has worked in other countries countless times before, maybe you should take a look at the deep pockets of the insurance industry.\n\nI know that means that I'm admitting Obama's plan isn't perfect, but that is to be expected: he had to compromise between the various powerful groups that had something to gain/lose, many of whom influenced the republican and democratic members of congress etc. Otherwise, his plan would have been killed in congress a lot sooner.\n\nEdit: I also want to stress that it's 'tradition' for the party that holds the presidency to lose seats in the midterms, it's been pretty well documented on both sides of the political spectrum. The only two exceptions in the last ten presidents are Bush jr and Kennedy, but in both cases external factors were at play (9/11 and the Cuban missile crisis). I can link you the article if you want to, it's a fivethirtyeight piece. In any case, you can't argue with certainty that the  midterm elections went poorly for the Dems because of the ACA. You cant exclude that it played a role either, just trying to insert some nuance in the discussion.
So I don't know where exactly you found this, but based on your county I looked up some geological maps of the region (see the site of the USGS here: https://ngmdb.usgs.gov/Prodesc/proddesc_37466.htm) and I think it's part of the Aquia formation, of Paleocene age (66-56 million years old, probably more towards 66-60, but I can't find a more detailed stratigraphy). \n\nThe description seems to be a good match (see the geological map, lower left): the Aquia formation is a sandy formation, sometimes glauconitic (greenish) and calcareous. More importantly it contains layers of calcareous sandstone (hard rocks, which you have) of up to 6 feet thick, rich in fossils, more specifically *Turritella mortoni* (a gastropod or 'snail' with a high cone) and *Ostrea Compressirostra* (an oyster). These look like what you have, although I'm not a specialist on gastropods or bivalves so I can't be 100percent sure. The only thing I'm not sure about is whether this formation is present and at what depth at your exact location, but you can look that up for yourself on the maps of the USGS if you want.
You see, that's all fine and dandy, but the reality of the situation is that 50% of the people disagree. That is a big enough percentage that it should worry anyone: we can't just shove them to the side. The president is, in the first place, the leader of *all* citizens, and not just his constituents. That is, imo, the reason why a lot of campaign promises are never kept.
Conservative leaning maybe, I honestly don't know. But not Trump-leaning, that's for sure.
Also, he'd lose his hairpiece
He is. He's also a pretty strong commander, but he can be built quite versatile, in contrast with the other very strong Sultai commander, Leovold.

Rule 5?
Agree 
I am assuming a lot both ideals. I don't actually believe anything Is possible in ether an an-cap society or a libertarian. They are both utopian ideals. You simply seam to think that an-cap and libertarians are no different. So I explained and answered your confusions. \n\nThe libertarian society would fall apart if the government got controlled by non libertarians. Just like an-cap fall apart when nonaggression is not fallowed by a largish wealthy group. \n\nAs you would be ruled by mob however (I assume) the mob would be libertarian so no force would ever be used unless you broke the NAP.\n\nI am assuming your an an-cap  simply put I believe non aggression but I also believe that none of my capital can be assured if without a government body.    \nYou don't think you need a central body to assure your capital. That is just the difference between us.

No that's some rare shit
It is a collective group that is agreed on by majority of the public it governs. That's how it's different than a business who only exists for the single purpose of its being prosperous. \n\nTheoretically it can go "out of business", however in a libertarian society it wouldn't become unfunded because the population would be reliably fund it.

To be a grey you must believe in the grey code, and that means being balanced to the force via killing more dark or light force users and also using and embracing all emotions. Ahsoka has a predisposition to regret anger (even if she loses her cool from time to time) and she favors the Jedi way over the Sith. She is a rogue Jedi, or even just a force user, but that doesn't make her a grey.\n\nUnless someone in universe randomly finds a tablet or some shit, there will never be a real grey in canon. To be a grey you have to actively fallow the code, which seems to have been forgotten.

Ancaps generally believe in a complete abolition of the government, libertarians (the political philosophy) believes in the a minimalist government. They believe similar ideas for similar reasons (i.e. The non aggression pact). In an-cap the gold (capitalism) and the black (anarchy) all forms of anarchy have the black. Most modern symbols for libertarianism use gold  (capitalism) and gray (weaker government = is halfway to black). Hints the modern libertarian party's use of a gold flame torch with a grey base. I saturated this original wallpaper. If you would like, I can link you the old image with the black.

And Howard Dean endorses Pete Buttigieg. Yeah!!!
Wow. I hadn't seen that before.\n\nWhat a sad and cynical person he must be.
Thanks for the info! I didn't want to get left behind...
> Maher certainly knows Milo is a troll\n\nMaybe, but I wouldn't be so sure. I forget if it was the town hall or some interview he did, but there was something recently where Milo was brought up and Bill sounded like he really didn't know much about the guy. But, especially with the Scahill situation, I'm sure he's done some research on him since then.\n\nShould be interesting...
Just curious, since VS2017 release is supposed to drop soon. I haven't tried out the beta versions, but what were the pain points you had with 2017 vs 2015?
That's pretty cool. I've wanted to do more with code generation for awhile now. But I think for it to really take off, it needs to be integrated into the IDE. Because ideally, you'd really want to be able to debug and step through the generated code.\n\nDon't get me wrong. For some use cases, like this one, it may make sense. But I'd love to see code generation become more of a first class citizen in the future.
Maybe the Democrats should have welcomed independents into their primaries and nominated someone who excited their base and could win.
Ah, thanks for the tip!

Just tolerating it because there's no alternative.\n\nI realize I'm not the average user, but I disable the subreddit-specific CSS styles. I don't want or need "fancy" themes. I just want information on all of the subjects I'm interested in. I think the Craigslist example works here well too.\n\nYou're right, though. I don't *love* the design. I just don't mind it. At all.

Huh, I'm surprised I hadn't seen those before. Thanks for the info!\n\nIt's an interesting direction, but I think I do prefer the stylized look. That said, there's certainly room for improvement.
That's fucking awesome!
Haven't watched it yet, but I believe this is the whole episode:\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqszZR4smEg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqszZR4smEg)
This episode was a bit of a roller coaster ride.\n\nIt started out fine. The monologue was good and I thought the Al Franken interview was great.\n\nThen came the panel. And Piers really clogged up the flow of that. I actually even agreed with a couple of the points he made. But he just wouldn't STFU.\n\nThe Jeffries interview was alright, but nothing special. But then when Piers hit peak bullshit level, watching Jeffries shut him down was amusing.\n\nFinally, New Rules was OK. I liked the sentiment of it, but I don't think it was as solid as they sometimes are.
Yeah, this looks like it's going to be fun ;)
Good stuff! Kinda surprised they didn't throw Veep into the mix.
I hope you're right!\n\nNext step is to figure out if there's a way I can avoid buying yet another arcade stick.
I think that Vega win pose is hideous, IMO.\n\nBut in general, I think they did a nice job with the visuals. The effects, especially, look fantastic!
I hear ya on that!\n\nYou'd think USB being a standard would let all these sticks work on any system. But they have a lame tendency to make them not compatible.\n\nI am happy I can use my PS3 stick for SF5 on PS4. But even that is kind of tedious.
His cabinet appointments already disqualify him from being able to do a decent job.\n\nDon't get me wrong. I'm keeping my fingers crossed for the best. And I am happy about the TPP. But, if I had to bet money, I think the next 4 years are going to be a hot mess.
> But anyone who thinks isolationism and nationalism will fix anything is out of their goddamn mind. \n\nIsolationism? Please...\n\nYou do realize we're able to trade with countries around the world today, right? The TPP isn't about opening up trade. It's about expanding our IP laws and making them a global standard.
I don't think they interacted much with the computer, but that looks pretty fun!
About time. Let's get this party started!

> My only hope is for the Galaxy S8 to be Daydream ready, that would be quite cool.\n\nI'm really hoping for that too!
I'm OK with paying for online servers.\n\nIt's the thought of buying a new arcade stick, or even an adapter, to play offline-only that I'm scared of. I can't see it gaining much traction, if that's the case.
You could render your gameobjects into a RenderTexture and then use that texture on a RawImage UI component.\n\nHere's a quick video I found that should explain how to set up the RenderTexture:\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pA7ZC8owaeo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pA7ZC8owaeo)

> If you have access to break the mesh into individual triangles and use for example UV3 to store the barycentric coordinates then you can get this to work pretty good on mobile as well.\n\nJust curious how you are handling this. Are you calculating these in your modeling program before export? Or are you running a post-import script inside of Unity?
No. It's convenient.
Cool stuff!\n\nHow did you handle the curved UIs? I assume you're rendering a normal UI canvas into a texture, right? Any tricks in setting that up or is it pretty straight-forward?\n\nWhat's not obvious to me is how you're handling the input. Are you able to detect ray-casts hits, remap the coordinates, and spoof fake input commands into the UI? Or is it some other sorcery?
Great set! Thanks for posting!
Same. Shit just got real.
Yeah, I think that type of thing could work as an extra on youtube or on his blog. The show is already pretty packed.
Thanks for the tips!
Huh. That does sound convoluted, but good to know. Thanks!
Looks pretty cool!
That's great to hear! I'm thinking about getting one of the 1070 models when I go to upgrade my HTPC. Nice to know they really can work with the Rift.
WW would be problematic. Pretty sure you can't pick the same character for both players. And CE was a balance nightmare.\n\nIf they really wanted to do it up old-school, I think Hyper Fighting would be the best option.
> One minute Bill's saying that the Dems need to change, and then he brings out old-time party faithfuls like Fonda and Olbermann?\n\nAgreed. And he had on Tom Perez, who is the establishment pick for the DNC chair.\n\nI mean, Tom seems like an alright guy and everything. But if Bill really wants the party to change, it just seems like an odd choice for a premiere episode guest.\n\nI'm hoping next week he gets back to mixing things up a bit.
It's not just command grabs. The throw ranges, in general, seem way too small to me in this game.
I can't believe I didn't know about this before. Seems like it'd be perfect for creating libraries to use in Unity3D game projects.
Yeah, I'm with you. The whole Russia thing feels like the left's Benghazi. I think they're trying to put way too much focus on it.
> Unless your site is all about in-depth articles, maximizing brevity is likely going to help serve a site's purpose.\n\nThat's certainly true. And there are definitely some landing pages where that style can work. I just think it's overused.\n\nI guess my take-away from this article is that it's more important to nail the delivery of information, than it is to make it look pretty. Don't get me wrong, I think you can do both. But if you're only going to put thought into one of them, I think usability > style.
> The TPP would have been a fantastic treaty\n\nI think expanding IP laws is a really bad idea that would hurt people and workers, while further enriching corporate interests. Why do you think it would be fantastic?\n\n> And about the Bernard-types, I would really not like them in the party.\n\nThen the left will continue to lose.
That's awesome!\n\nI'm still rocking a Note4 and have been wanting to upgrade. I was *going to* get a Note7, but that didn't pan out. If my next upgrade has positional tracking, that'd be fantastic!
Oh snap. That's great news!
Seriously. Barring even the BBC takes this move from "seriously fucked up" territory into "what the fucking fuck?!" land.\n\nI really don't even know what to say...
[Qualcomm also said they were "Born mobile"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7qTHbOEiDY)
I feel dumb, but I don't understand this chart. 
Thanks for the video! There's several interesting things in it:\n\n[Unlike HDR, classic graphics = classic backgrounds too.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6_hdFYeU9w&feature=youtu.be)\n\n[Plays like ST, not HDR @ 3:09](https://youtu.be/X6_hdFYeU9w?t=189)\n\n[Net play confirmed @ 6:06](https://youtu.be/X6_hdFYeU9w?t=374)\n\n[Violent Ken's Super @ 12:40](https://youtu.be/X6_hdFYeU9w?t=760)\n\nA few other things I noticed:\n\n- The high score is "ONI". I wonder if he's in this game too?!\n- Some of the sound FX sound weird to me.\n- They're playing in slow WW speed. I hope that's only optional.\n- They try Evil Ryu's super but it gets stuff immediately.\n\n[This match shows all of these @ 13:15](https://youtu.be/X6_hdFYeU9w?t=795)\n
No, you dumb fucking dildos.\n\nGood grief! What has our current politics devolved into? Is everyone taking crazy pills?! Because this being the top post in my feed makes me feel like it...
Hmm. It wasn't a bad promo. But it also didn't hook me as much as I wish it did.\n\nThis season will be interesting. I'm mostly looking forward to seeing how Jonah fares in Congress.
That'd be great! But, I'm curious what makes you so sure about that.
Who cares if it's bipartisan? So are oil subsidies.\n\nWe need *less* propaganda these days, not more. I don't care if it's foreign groups, left/right wing media empires, political action groups like Correct The Record, think tanks, etc. There's too much of this shit.\n\n
I agree. While some of the recent episodes have been entertaining, in their own way, this is the first episode in awhile where everyone seemed calm, informed, and genuine in what they were saying.\n\nThis episode reminded me of what Real Time used to be like before this 2016 circus came to town. Good stuff!\n\nI also really like the New Rules. Losing good people over sex scandals has been something that has annoyed me for a long time. I'm glad to see Bill push back on that.
Close, but I think you meant 4 spaces ;)
Im totally down for a new SF2. But I noticed a lack of talk about online play. Without that, I can't see me playing it.
> And just wanted to say all the posts saying, "we can't let us divide us. They're both progressives!" reflect why the Bernie wing of the party is so pissed off. It's pretty insulting to admit there's barely a difference between the two and you can't even just give a symbolic victory to the Bernie wing of the party. It really feeds into the House Always Wins/corporate DNC elitist narrative Bernie voters have tried to fight. \n\nI completely agree. If they really thought they were essentially the same, Perez wouldn't have jumped in after Ellison was in the race and the establishment wouldn't have backed him.\n\nIt's clear that there is some amount of pressure being applied to the party from the progressive side. But the party is showing, through it's actions, that it wants to resist that crowd at every single turn.\n
Eh, the new one is OK. But I thought the old theme was perfect.\n\nI'm more annoyed by the bright red on the new set.
Would defintely like to see a PC port. A PS4 port would be nice too!
Absolutely! It was a really great part of the show. I'd love to see that, or even something similar to those segments again.
> It isn't ethical relativism to suggest things are more complex than simplistic idealism.\n\nIn general, I would agree. However, I think it's also healthy to take a step back, from time to time, and re-assess where we're at. And, as pointed as the title is, I do think it's reasonable to ponder whether our strategy in the Middle East is doing more good or more harm, overall.\n\nI certainly don't think I have the knowledge to come to a fair conclusion. But from an outsiders perspective, it certainly doesn't seem like what we're doing is making things better.\n
It used to be so easy on XBox Live to send a simple "gg" (Or whatever) after a match. I literally don't even know how to look up someone on the PS4 to send them a message. It's crazy.
I tried to switch to vaping a couple years ago and got one of those pen type units. It didn't really do it for me, but I do occasionally use it to cut down a bit on my cigs.\n\nPlan on getting a new unit next year and giving it another go.
I'm really not sure what point it is that you guys are trying to make. NATO, NAFTA, and the TPP are all quite different. That he happens to oppose all of them is a meaningless metric.\n\nMy point is that "isolationism" is a lazy and inaccurate term to argue your case. If the OP thinks the TPP is a good idea, then (s)he should say why, instead of hand-waving it off with with some vague BS.\n\n
Alex Jones is 8th?! That's fucked up...
> it has turned the front page into a raging tech support forum.\n\nAn alternate idea is to make another sub for oculus support/problems/tips/tec. It's not like the sensor stuff is the only issue you can run into.\n\nJust thinking aloud, since I generally hate/ignore mega-threads.\n\n
We aren't talking about NATO or NAFTA. We're talking about the TPP.\n\nAnd we are, quite arguably, the least isolated nation in the entire world. So you'll have to excuse me if I don't think using isolationism is a reasonable term to use when discussing opposition to a single trade proposal.
How have I not seen that before? That was cringe-tastic!
Who cares? There's less than 20 posts on this sub in the last year. And that other sub hasn't had a single post in 3 years.
I get the frustration and the desire to protest. And I'm sure things like this provide a cathartic release.\n\nBut ask yourself - is this really constructive? Is further buckling down and perpetuating an us vs them mentality helpful?\n\nPerhaps it is. But before we rush out and pat each other on the back and cry "go team!", it's something worth thinking about.
Wow, cool story bro!\n\nIMO, SF5 is a much better game than SF4 ever was. Fundamentals matter again. The net-code isn't swimming in variable input lag. And the gameplay isn't dominated by retarded vortexes and back-dashing and option-select hell.\n\nI really don't get the hate-train for SF5...
What is that from?
There needs to be a Star Trek game where the computer works like this and has the same voice from the show.
Nigga please. If you're talking about a BBC show, the term you're looking for is mate.
Thanks for the recommendation! I'll have to study up a bit on what's out there these days.
It did start out pretty bad, but I thought it was getting a lot better towards the end.\n\nAt any rate, I do like Larry and am glad to see him on the show. I wish more of the Comedy Central folks (Stewart, Colbert, Oliver, Sam Bee, etc) made appearance's on Real Time.
I fucking *love* both the opening and the ending sequences for FF8!
Interesting. I didn't know about any of that.\n\nI really liked Jonah and Richard together. I hope they still get a chance to interact this season.
Yeah, his stance on space continues to baffle me too. Especially since he's had Neil deGrasse Tyson on a number of times and fawned over Seth and Neil's reboot of Cosmos.\n\nSomehow, he seems to be impressed by, and points to, our knowledge of space, while simultaneously pushing back on us spending any time or money on furthering our knowledge in it.\n\nIt makes no sense.
> Depends on the implementation, GGPO with customizable input latency control ala Skullgirls would probably be fine.\n\nGGPO net-code would be *fan-fucking-tastic*! But, I'm not gonna hold my breath for that.\n\nHDR had GGPO-ish net-code. It wasn't as good, but it was good enough. Honestly, I'd be fine with that. And given the code-base, I assume that's the most likely scenario.\n\nBut I am a little suspicious that online play wasn't mentioned at all. It'd be a real shame if a new SF2 in this day and age didn't have any online play.
Whoa! Those are massive changes. I just saw some video where they said it didn't play like HDR, and that it played like ST. But, I guess not.\n\nInteresting...
The worst one I can think of is [Wayne Allyn Root.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QlHUJFZchNM) That show went completely off the rails!
John Waters is always hilarious. Looking forward to it.
Back in the GGPO days, people spammed the insert coin sound to say "GG". Good times!
A lot of the iconic picks are already listed, several of which might've been my answer. So, instead, I'll list my favorite background/ambient music:\n\n[FFX - Wandering Flames](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oxRd_5ERYKw)
Is that you [Bill Burr?](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/bill-burr-hillary-clinton-conan_us_58906a5ee4b0522c7d3ce6c4)\n\nAt any rate, yeah this is pretty lame. The DNC did a terrible job during this election. And not just with the Presidential campaign, but all around.
> alpha 4\n\nDon't toy with my emotions!
I hope there's a way to turn off color edit mode when you play online.\n\nI really don't want to deal with people's janky color mixups.
Yeah, this was a solid show! And that was one of the best New Rules in quite some time.
Cool. Thanks for sharing the details.
You could easily make a video about SF4:AE with Yun and make similar points. Or SF3:3S with Chun to make similar points. Or even go back to SF2:ST and use Vega or Old Sagat to make similar points.\n\nThere's always some bullshit in every game, and usually some characters that stand out above the rest of the cast. Characters that aren't just good, but stupidly good. It happens.\n\nAt the end of the day, is it worth it? It boils down to whether you find the game fun or not. If not, wait for the next season/patch and try again.
She said she was 18!
I also reject the notion that an employer paying for health-care, which in turn pays for the pills, which in turn an employee might use is in any way equal to the owners of the company taking the pills or having an abortion themselves.\n\nThey also pay their employees wages. And that money could be used for abortions, birth control, or any number of things the owners of the company might not like.\n\nIf someone isn't comfortable with how their employees might use their compensation, maybe they shouldn't be running a business.
> SF5 is the most inherently Street Fighter title since ST itself, because it follows the actual mold formed by SF2 and doesn't break away from it to be something else. A lot of of SF4 players don't realize that they'd actually be much better off playing Tekken or Guilty Gear, and that SF4 was the aberrant title in the series doing and being something very far from its history.\n\nThis is the straight up truth!\n\nAs another old-school player that came up during the SF2 era, I fucking *hated* SF4. And after playing SF5, it reinforced every complaint I had about that game.\n\nI'm not great at SF5. I don't have the time, the reactions, or the desire to put into it that I did with older games. But I'm alright. And it *feels* like Street Fighter to me again. Footsies matter. Reads matter. You don't get vortexed to death, people can't back-dash for free, and so on.\n\nI really enjoy SF5, and I hope more people will grow to enjoy it as well.
Yeah, I love Bernie, but I don't get the impression that they cut him off here. Shit happens.
By far, my favorite ending to any game ever! So many great moments with all of the characters. And the music - perfection!
>   Pushing further left will likewise cause an opposition push to the right.\n\nThat *is* what has happened since the 1980s. We *have* been in a long-term counter push to the right. And now, we do need to push back to the left.\n
Personally I'm okay with that. If Republicans don't, then Democrats doing it just hinders them against Republicans. We have thousands of races to win across 50 states - it takes money and not every race is going to garner the enthusiasm and small donations that nationwide presidential races with personalities like Sanders do. \n\nIndividual candidates are still free to refuse that money for their own personal campaigns, and that will even set them apart and help them rather than removing it as a positive point for them since all candidates have that by force. \n\nAnd remember that Planned Parenthood and the Sierra Club and other groups that support liberal causes and help elect Democrats are "lobbyists." Lobbyists aren't all bankers or oil companies looking out for their own interests. 
If bust is acceptable to you, then stop pretending you care about issues and people. \n\n
Neither of those. \n\nHe said no lobbyists in his admin.\n\nwhomp whomp

Yep. The Dem's have lost both houses and the White House, there's no point in hamstringing ourselves when the other side won't.

What? Everyone has to provide ID in some form at the polls. Voter fraud is virtually nonexistent.
Why should it matter? 45% of Democratic primary voters felt he should be the presidential candidate for the party and agreed with his beliefs and platform enough to trust him to be the figurehead of the nation. One of the top reasons people didn't vote for Bernie was they didn't think he would win. I'd bet that if you polled democrats on if they agree with Bernie, a majority would support him. 
Exactly. Iraq was devastated by the Iran-Iraq War, then The First Gulf War, then the second Gulf War. Imagine attacking a country that wasn't devastated by 2 wars in the past 2 decades.
There are bans in some provinces.
No he wants to increase it 54 billion meaning total spending would be closer to 700 billion
It's kind of bizarre that she can't see Hillary for what she is. Samantha Bee is Canadian and Hillary Clinton is more right wing on a lot of things than even the Canadian Conservative Party. I was very disappointed in her.
The US government could save many tens of thousands more lives by spending the money that is used to "fight terrorism" on health initiatives to reduce heart attacks. [610,000 people die every year or 1/4 of all deaths are by by heart attack](https://www.cdc.gov/heartdisease/facts.htm). \n\nThe military budget needs to be cut. 
r/HailCorporate 
What you are saying is that although every single other industrialized nation has universal healthcare there is something wrong with them. I happen to think that the US is the wrong on this one because we have allowed our government to be bribed by insurance companies, drug companies and private hospitals. That report you cite imagines a universal system that does not nationalize insurance and does not put controls on drug costs. \n\nCanada pays roughly half of what we pay for healthcare and everyone is insured. ~90% of Canadians would choose their healthcare system over ours. Also 57% of Americans want a universal healthcare system.
[Actually, 58% support universal healthcare.](http://www.gallup.com/poll/191504/majority-support-idea-fed-funded-healthcare-system.aspx)
I bought one off Amazon.ca years ago. They sell it because it's legal. There is a loophole in the law I guess.
Democrats should be better than that stuff. If she wasn't so corrupt, she would have won. She literally went around for a couple years charging $225,000 per speech to large corporations in order to launder her bribe money before she ran for president.
Canada is one of the best countries in the world. Our government isn't perfect but, it is not the root of our problems.
Not to mention the more than 100,000 Iraqis killed.
Exactly, the media has been attacking Trump on exploiting this dead SEAL but they almost never mention the 9 children and 6 women killed in the raid. 
First democratic constitution. Britain was a slow transition to a more democratic government. It is really hard to compare as democracy in that day did mean white landowners could vote
Maybe you should blame Hillary instead. Almost half the country didn't vote. Maybe Hillary could have spent the campaign not hanging out at private fundraisers with corporate executives, wealthy elites, and most of all Wall Street bankers and hedge fund managers. [She got 122 million dollars from hedge funds alone.](https://www.wsj.com/articles/hedge-fund-money-has-vastly-favored-clinton-over-trump-1469784601) How the hell did she think she would connect with the average American if she was raking in hundreds of millions from big oil, big pharma, insurance companies, Monsanto, Goldman Sachs, Comcast, Time Warner, Citigroup, anyone and everyone who was involved in the 2008 financial crisis, and arms manufacturers?
I guess. Also shows how the media did such a terrible job in showing the destructive and dangerous things that Tumps picks have done or want to do.
Media is generally neoliberal. Pro-privatization, less regulation, lower taxes, flat taxes, open borders, and free trade. It's generally a product of the fact that its ownership generally stands to become even richer through neoliberal policies. 
I'm sure it seems that way when you live in East Vancouver but, Chinese people [represent 4.3% of the population.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada#Ethnicity)
She won't. She is opposed to single payer healthcare, generally hawkish in military policy, and she took more money from the very rich and corporate America than any candidate in history.
Experience in dealing with America's two closest allies.
It's basically the end result of unregulated, free market capitalism.
He supports TPP and will not reinstate Obama's ban on corporate lobbyists. 
The fisheries part is absolutely horrible.
Jon's last segment on his show where he talked about Bernie's campaign just after it started was incredible. \nEdit, Here is the link: http://mediamatters.org/video/2015/05/29/the-daily-show-blasts-medias-dismissive-coverag/203808
Honestly as a liberal, nothing bugs me more when other liberals talk about how great Obama was. He is a warmonger who allowed his government to spy without warrant on millions of his own people. Then right before Trump takes office, he expands spying powers. 
Thing is most voters don't support progressive ideas but, most Americans do.
He wants to raise taxes on the rich however, he also wants a small increase taxes on the middle class.\n\nIf implemented, his middle class tax increase proposal would be to cover a universal healthcare system. You would pay a bit more in taxes but, healthcare would be covered and 97% of Americans would come out ahead financially. Canadians pay about half of what Americans pay per capita for healthcare and everyone in the country is covered.\n\nEdit: He also wants to cut military spending which costs taxpayers 500 billion a year and represents more than half of government discretionary spending. That would decrease taxes or at least put a dent in the deficit.
Colbert isn't as bad as the others but, at a certain point I don't want to hear any more about Trump.
CNN, MSNBC, CBS, and most other networks on TV all have shows that have remarkably similar opinions on nearly everything. \n\nThere is almost never someone on TV who disagrees with the Drone program, wants to decriminalize drugs, wants to increase taxes on the ultra rich, wants more environmental regulations, or wants to cut the military budget. The owners of these networks wouldn't let those opinions exist for too long on their networks. 
It would be way too much that we try to limit the influence of corporate lobbyists in a party that is supposed to represent the working class. 
I can't see the video as i'm outside of the US but, I believe this is the right one. I don't think Jon would have done that. http://mediamatters.org/video/2015/05/29/the-daily-show-blasts-medias-dismissive-coverag/203808
Cory Booker is too close to Wall Street, privatization of public schools, and big pharma. He is a corporate democrat through and through. 
Not all of Canada gets cold enough for people to use flip phones. I live on Vancouver Island, where it barely gets to -5 (23F).
Plus in 35 states, inmates can't vote. They arrest black people at much higher rates even when comparing crime rates. They also have the highest prison population in the world. 
I really hate all of these people in DNC leadership. They are all corporate puppets. We need to get rid of them.
He could have stopped it by himself if he wanted to. 
This is usually for people further North in Canada. Usually around -35C (-31F) is where problems really start to arise. 
I was just thinking that. A counterweight system isn't hard to do. That garage door opener is horrible.
The New York Times is leftist in the sense that it is neoliberal. If anything, it is a very pro-corporation paper. That is why you see them attacking leftist ideas like universal healthcare, environmentalism, and generally defending the status quo. Most people in Canada, Australia, and Europe would consider the NYT very conservative economically and socially liberal.
Woosh
Thing is Clinton was so far to the right economically, she was half against me.

Yeah, they pay 5-10 times what we do for drugs because the US government does nothing to regulate costs.

They can't go to war. That is a big one.\n

I don't get how all the others have such high favorability. Pence would have 25% unfavorability rating if people actually knew his policies. 
true
Well at least not for several hundred thousand years.
They will use Bernie to attack Trump now, then prop up a corporate Wall Street Democrat in time for the 2020 election.
It's better than the perfectly choreographed politicians that the democrats roll out year after year. At least he isn't wearing $2000 suits like the rest of them.

Trump voters were voting for the "fuck you" candidate. They wanted to burn down the system. 
I'd suggest adding more owl. 
Yeah, I should have checked that. You are right.\n
And if you voted twice in Canada, they would see it in the system. There is such a low incentive to vote twice because elections are decided by hundreds or thousands of votes, not 1 vote.\n
Yeah those Canadian drugs will kill you. Canada has a complete lack of drug safety standards. I'm sure Booker's initial vote had nothing to do with the quarter million in "donations" to his campaigns from pharmaceutical companies. \n\nThis vote is just an effort to redeem himself so he can make an attempt for president in 2020.
I don't think smoking means you are stupid. Many of the smartest people I know smoke.
Except, Booker took a quarter million in donations from Pharma companies and these companies keep raising prices on drugs that people will die without. Cutting drug prices will not reduce the jobs. It will just reduce corporate executive and shareholder profits.
She should have built a counterweight system so the owner could just lift the bed up and pull it down manually.
Really accurate description
Looks a bit tacky to be honest.
We emptied the Atlantic. We will empty the Pacific. \n\nThey need to drastically reduce commercial quotas and focus on sport fishing. We have seen a real decline in sportfishing catches on the West Coast. \n\nPeople from across Canada and the US fly to BC to sportfish. They spend $100+ per night on a hotel room and $500-1500 per day fishing. They the go out and spend hundreds of dollars on dinner, groceries, alcohol, and fish processing. Sportfishing brings way more money to the BC economy per pound of fish compared to commercial fishing. 
No she changed her stance because she thought she would lose. When you take $200,000,000 million from Wall Street banks and hedge funds, sometimes you are going to have to lie to the public about what you actually support. http://www.politico.com/story/2016/07/terry-mcauliffe-hillary-clinton-tpp-trade-226253\nhttp://www.politico.com/story/2016/10/hillary-clinton-trade-deal-229381
Not really sure why you were downvoted. She should have stood up to the Democrats. You can't change a party by trying to play nce all the time.
I don't deny that Trump has ties to Russia but, there is no proof that it was the Russians that hacked the DNC. Members of the intelligence community do have reason to lie about that as they may have political disagreements with Trump. 
I voted Clinton, but Trump does not excuse Clinton. 
Half the eligible voters in the country didn't vote. \n\nYou could say the same thing about them rather than blaming the election on people who did decide to participate. People don't owe the Democrats their vote. We as Democrats need to give people reasons to vote for us. Clinton was the "more of the same" candidate. That is why she lost. The American middle class is in decline in this country and there is a real lack of good jobs. People are hurting financially and they are angry at politicians in Washington. \n\n\nIt also didn't help that Hillary spent a lot of the campaign with the ultra-rich and the corporate elites at fundraisers where it costs $300,000 to go.\n\nI really wanted Clinton to win but, she ran a terrible campaign. Many millions of people will suffer under Trump. 
I love their burgers but, their fries and onion rings are shit.\n
Not owl. Not superb. 
If there is a candidate that wants to raise Time Warner's tax rate, corporate will make sure their coverage of that candidate is very negative.
Why blame Clinton's loss on Sanders when polls showed that more Sanders voters voted for Clinton in the general than 08 clinton voters voted for Obama?\n\nHalf the eligible voters in the country didn't vote.\nYou can blame the election on them except for the fact that nobody owes the democrats their vote and Clinton could not convince enough people to vote for her. \n\nIt didn't help that Hillary choose to spend a lot of the campaign with the ultra-rich and the corporate elites at fundraisers where it costs $300,000 to go. The American middle class is in decline in this country and there is a real lack of good jobs. People are hurting financially and they are angry at politicians in Washington. It isn't surprising that a candidate who is dining with billionaires in private resorts isn't going to connect. \n\n\nI really wanted Clinton to win but, she ran a terrible campaign. Many millions of people will suffer under Trump.\n\nEdit: Before anyone says "but, Trump". \n\nDemocrats are supposed to run on helping the middle class and connecting with working people. Look at Sanders, he wins 25% of the Republican vote in the whole state of Vermont. Last election he won with 71.1% of the vote. Trump ran on a buisness "get things done" approach. He flaunted his wealth to show how successful he was even if it was untrue. 
The Republicans will use Trump to get tax cuts for the rich, a right wing supreme court, destruction of core government departments, destruction of Obamacare, increased military spending, massive deregulation, oil subsidies, abortion restrictions, and maybe a war or two. \n\nWhen there is a severe enough reaction from the public who is hurt by these policies, they will impeach Trump, let him take the blame, and quell the public reaction. Pence will not need to do much but, he will not undo the harmful policies put in place by Republicans with Trump. Republicans, Wall Street, and corporate America wins.
Honestly that should have been done a long time ago.\n
Just curious, why is that your favourite?
Time Warner owns CNN. Trump is better for their shareholder profits than a Democrat that actually wants to raise taxes on the rich and corporations. CNN will ignore and attack anyone that gets in the way of their parent company's profits. 
Not to mention, the 9 children and 6 women killed in the raid.

Oligarchy - a form of government in which all power is vested in a few persons or in a dominant class or clique; government by the few. It has nothing to do with oil. \n\nIt isn't good. The reason the party lost so badly in 2016 is because people view the party as being too close to Wall Street.
Thing is the party doesn't even attempt any reasonable measures in their platform.

Fact #1 [Americans pay more for healthcare than any other country on Earth.](https://www.forbes.com/sites/danmunro/2014/06/16/u-s-healthcare-ranked-dead-last-compared-to-10-other-countries/#750088b7576f)\n\n\nFact #2 [Despite paying more for healthcare than any other country, the American system leaves 28.6 million people or 9.1% of the population uninsured](https://www.wsj.com/articles/number-of-uninsured-in-u-s-drops-below-10-for-first-time-in-2015-1463501948)\n\nFact #3 [The United States is ranked #37 in the world in healthcare by the World Health Organization.](http://thepatientfactor.com/canadian-health-care-information/world-health-organizations-ranking-of-the-worlds-health-systems/)\n\nFact #4 [Over 10,000 Americans die each year due to lack of insurance because they delay going to the doctor.](http://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2009/09/new-study-finds-45000-deaths-annually-linked-to-lack-of-health-coverage/)\n\nFact #5 [The U.S. is the only industrialized or first world country without a universal healthcare system.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_with_universal_health_care)\n\nWhy are you asking "What is wrong with the rest of the developed world?" and not "What is wrong with the United States?". \n\n\nCanada's health care system is not the greatest in the world but, one of the reasons I live in Canada(dual-citizen) is that I pay less taxes for better services. My grandfather recently went to the doctor and they found a tumor. He was in surgery 2 days later. Sure we wait for non-emergency services but, I can see a doctor at a walk in clinic in between 30 minutes and 3 hours after I walk in. If there is a real emergency, you are in right away. It's called triage. The system needs improvement but, that doesn't mean it isn't preferable to the system south of the border. Norway has a universal system that is likely the greatest in the world and it costs far less than the American system.
Ellison!!!! No more corporate lobbyists.
There are several countries without significant oil reserves that are richer than the US in GDP per capita with universal systems. The two are not mutually exclusive. \nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_GDP_(PPP)_per_capita
Usually the first group to do something is less successful than others who improve on the idea later. \n
At least in 2016, there were significant policy differences between the two. 
Problem is most Americans support it but, most voters don't. Not that either the Republicans or Democrats support such a healthcare system.

If you are only staying a week, I'd recommend choosing only one province. \n\nMany Europeans make the mistake of going to Vancouver, Calgary, Banff, Victoria, Nanaimo, and the West coast of Vancouver Island all in one week or two.

No, unfortunately I don't think Texas is going to become a safe dem state until 35+ years down the line at the very least.

Yes, I think that was a typo.

Ok, thank you but I disagree.\n\nI think that the issue of BC encompasses the related issue of women's "burden" of choice (privilege from men's p.o.v.) when they conceive an unplanned pregnancy. Again, I'll reiterate I'm a huge supporter of women's rights but this just doesn't seem to me to be something people are willing to debate openly so I'm simply trying to open the dialogue on a controversial issue. I'm also not including the extreme cases (rape/date rape/etc.), where women certainly deserve the privilege of choice, in this debate - just a typical "dating" situation where the sex is consensual.
there's also a "Rent OB 92107" FB group, not sure if it's moderated tighter now but worth a shot too
Mentioned in the article is how Obama used X many more drone strikes than Bush... but is this *objectively* a bad thing?\n\n\n**Isn't the real question the efficacy of the strikes? \nWhat was the fraction of civilian casualties per 100 or 1000 strikes?**\n\n\nI'm not a fan of more bombs at all, but it is important to understand WHY certain metrics are claimed/touted over others.. \n**Put on you Critical Thinking Hats people...**
hopeful for the butterfly effect I guess.... one hilarious troll post could take this to the TOP! :p \n\nthanks for pretending to care for a minute at least
right, but besides the fact of uni's having several colleges within them, you usually only attend one college within a university anyhow, so this designation always just seemed pompous to me. \n\nAnyone see a real practical reason behind this besides massaging your own ego?

I'm a relatively young engineer and thought CFD analysis was interesting in school with a huge potential to impact technology development, but in 3yrs experience with gas turbines, I'm seeing CFD analysts perceived similar to technicians who operate test rigs. They just control the knobs and deliver results. It remains the engineers who dictate the analysis and what is being studied, with a similarly slow turn around time as running physical tests.\n\nI'd say if you're interested in energy learn Conjugate Heat Transfer applications for CFD but I'm not sure how nuanced this is considered to experts in the field.
Went to Fox Rental but called there corporate phone # (from google, maps for the airport location) and the "supervisor" offered us a STEAL OF A DEAL for just $247 for tonight for 21 days till Jan 28 AND INCLUDING the 1-way drop off Dee of $110! :)\n\nAnd then my twin brother, who   landed at the airport and this was all for, effing BALKED at the deal and made me call back for another 20 min wait while we argued about the frustrating bad snap judgment to believe the deal was "too good to be true"... only to find out The effing Economy car HE was trying to get a deal on is out of stock today.\n\nAll's well that ends well, we got thru 2nd time on the phone & got same deal but $242 turned into $360ish Sith minimal insurance, liability I think.
Hope your positive self talk went well this morning! :) Hope the 5 things you picked can turn into sort of a mantra to drown out the negative voice in your head. 
Hahahaha exercise soulmate, I really like that. :) 
Eh it's just a Tuesday, a Tuesday I want to punch in the neck, but still. So have a happy Tuesday dudes and dudettes! 
Congrats! Way to push yourself and achieve new goals. I'm proud of you fellow 🐍! :) 
Keep going! Plateaus are the worst but the scale does eventually get back to showing you lower numbers. Also I'm a fan of measuring so that when the scale doesn't show improvement at least you can see empirical data of loss someway. Good luck and keep going, you've got this! 
I use LoseIt and I love it. 
Dude/dudette that's so exciting! Keep up the great work! You deserve to get to your goal weight and be healthy! :)))
Veronica mars. \n\nHaven't watched the third season since it first aired but I've rewatched the first and second season so many times. :) 
Abed's line about being being deaf is what made me an instant fan and I watched all the episodes as they aired, even season 6 haha. 
Congrats on starting! You didn't put the weight on overnight, so it certainly won't come off that way. Take your time and do it right. I'd suggest maybe finding an app to help you track your calories. The FAQ in the sidebar is a great place to get some quick knowledge. Good luck fellow Loseiter! :) 
Congrats that's really awesome! :)
I actually rediscovered talking on the phone before a first date! It was great to hear tone of voice and really get to know them so much better than text. I will be doing this with all potential future dudes now. :)
Holy 💩 yes! If everything goes according to plan I'll be in ONDERLAND by the end of the challenge! \n\nCongrats on the 10 pounds lost OP!!! 
To lazy to look it up the scientific source, but it is proven that submerging in cold water ups your metabolic rate, thus helping you process that binge better. :)\n\nAlso OP, I second Socky's sentence: "You can break the cycle by forgiving yourself and choosing to make more healthful choices" at your next meal. Each meal is a chance to get it right and the guilt left over from some dubious choices is not great for your mental health. You have a chance to learn from this binge and come out a stronger Loseiter because of it. \n\nHugs to you OP! 
Yay! Now I need to rewatch that. :)
The people behind the counter are always so helpful with these kinds of questions! 
I'd park anywhere I wanted. 
It's this weird horrible thing us childfree ladies deal with. I wanted to get sterilized a few years ago and I went to three places and none of them would do it till I was 35 because (condescending tone) 'you could change your mind'. Ugh. Plus our procedure is much more complex than a mans, I'm really jealous that you were able to get it taken care of so easily! \n\n
I posted this on another LoseIt thread a few days ago, but seems relevant to your situation. :) \n\n---\nCongrats on day one! We are so glad to have you here! \n\nYou didn't put the weight on over night so it won't come off that way. Each day is a new start and each meal is a chance to get it right! Seriously, through this journey you'll slip up, so learn to forgive yourself and get back to it the next meal, try and stop yourself from saying 'ah f#€k it, I cheated earlier might as well eat like crap the rest of the day/week!' The time is going to pass anyway, might as well pass while becoming healthier! \n\nPersonally: I started my journey on slow carb diet (kind of like keto and paleo but different haha) and loved the way my body felt but it was, in the end, way to restrictive for my lifestyle. CICO (calories in, calories out) is easy to track with the LoseIt app (most on this sub use MFP) and I had those two beers, shot of whiskey and tacos last night while still losing weight! Plus I find it fun to see what I can fit into my budget each day, it gets addicting trying to keep it in the green. :)))\n\nExercise is wonderful! I do it daily. But you can not out exercise your fork OP.  \n\nI hope that you'll come back here a lot, especially when things get tough, as this place is wonderfully supportive and motivational! \n----\n\nAnyway OP I wish you the best in finding any kind of exercise that you enjoy but it really just comes down to physics; take in less calories than you burn and you'll lose weight. So you can get down to your ideal healthy weight without exercise! :) 
Congratulations man, you're killing it! \n\nWhat are you doing to train for the 5k? 
Oh it's like Zumba but hip hop instead. It's really a lot of fun! :)
Are you and u/landlubber77 connected? Are you both zodiac killer fan club members? ;)
Oh my gosh congrats!!! Also good luck with the surgery! :)
I've never used it like a social media site (i.e. Posting about myself), but I still love it for the news and I follow a lot of comedians. I'm 34 and I've used it since 2009. :)
Oh man when I did 4hb those first couple of cheat days were awesome. And then they just made me feel gross and became cheat meals instead of days.
I fully agree with this. The over adulation is really off-putting! 
Hey u/global_hotspot this is excellent. As someone who has been doing the online thing for a few years, this is spot on! 
Bravo.  So important in today's climate.  
I just got ghosted on because I asked for all three dates and initiated the first kiss and I wasn't a challenge. (A week later I asked point blank on OKC and that's what he told me.) So because of this one douchecanoe, I'm now a little worried that the next guy won't like it. Not that it's going to stop me, but it's a worry. :-/
Hahaha this made me chuckle, so thanks. :) 
Nope, I only do it while enjoying the company of gentlemen because it excites them. I'll occasionally pinch mine while masturbating, but my nipples don't get a ton of action when I'm solo. 
Yay us!!! 
Hey thanks for your response man. I don't agree with the devil on your shoulder but it's refreshing to hear personal reasoning behind harsh judgement of others. Have a happy Wednesday! 
Second on your brain just being an asshole. You can't do anything about the "what if" & "if only"s because that's not how it shook out. \nU/toomanymessages is right, you're strong enough to deal with this! 
You can both do it! Please remember that you didn't put the weight on overnight, so it sure as hell won't come off that way. You're in a for a long journey but one you won't regret. Stay strong and know that you deserve to get to your goals! 
Thanks! I'm another two pounds down. :))) So close to ONEDERLAND!

Seriously, through this journey you'll slip up, so learn to forgive yourself and get back to it the next meal, try and stop yourself from saying 'ah f#€k it, I cheated earlier might as well eat like crap the rest of the day/week!' Just think, if you are diligent and keep at it, by next Valentine's Day you could be 104pounds lighter, that's flipping awesome!!! The time is going to pass anyway, might as well pass while becoming healthier! \n\nPersonally: I started my journey on slow carb diet (kind of like keto and paleo but different haha) and loved the way my body felt but it was, in the end, way to restrictive for my lifestyle.

Mmmmmm that was yummy. What is the source? :) 
Me too! Every Friday morning. :) 
I just got ghosted on recently because I "asked for all three dates and initiated the first kiss and I wasn't a challenge." (A week later I asked point blank on OKC and that's what he told me.) So because of this one douchecanoe, I'm now a little worried that the next guy won't like it. Not that it's going to stop me, but it's a worry. :-/
Great question! :)\n\nI've recently got back into dance classes at my gym and I keep PRing on my mile. I'm also heading to the U.K. for three weeks, in 15 days, so I'm flipping excited! 
Fantastic progress!! Also cute socks. ;) 
That's one of my favorite [Onion](https://www.google.com/amp/www.theonion.com/amp/36896?client=safari) headlines!
That last sentence is something I'm going to remember, thanks! :) 
I have recently (last three weeks) been at the gym 5days a week for dance (Zumba and Muvz) classes and afterwards I've been doing a mile on the treadmill. And by mile, I mean running! I keep PRing on my time and I should be able to run the full mile, without stopping, here pretty quick. It makes me excited! 
Not putting on weight is excellent! Keep your head up and know that we 🐍 are here for you! 
Bwhahahahaha that is amazing and something I'll be telling my gym friends this evening, thanks! And congrats on Onederland! :)))
Flat path not at all necessary! Grab an umbrella and get outside! :) Future you will thank you for starting today, instead of putting it off. ;) Don't let the negative voice in your head stop you from trying/doing something! Laziness is partly what got you to a high weight and being more willing to get up and push yourself will be so rewarding. 
Probably not for a while. Food used to have control over you, now you're taking back control from food. Once you unlearn bad habits that got you to your high weight, food will just become something that nourishes you. \n\nAt least, that's my sleep-deprived theory right now. Haha. 
Gonorrhea\n\nIt is such a pretty word by itself, with no connotation. Such a pretty word for such an icky ailment. 
Parallel eating with them sounds like a great way to do that! They're eating healthy so eat with them, fantastic. :) 
One of the main reasons why I ended things with my ex fiancé was because he wouldn't travel with me and he wouldn't even think about adoption unless we were out of other options. I wasn't sold on the idea of being a mom but had less than zero interest in being pregnant so I ended things. He's now married with a kid and I'm still happily single and child-free! 
Ah I haven't listened to that in a while! Think I'll step back into Night Vale tonight. ;) 
Just not having it in the house is a good option for now, but what is your plan once you live with someone else? Have you come up with a long term plan on how to cope with the issues associated with your particular food issues? :) \n\n(Please know that my intention is not to come off like an asshole or be judgmental, I'm honestly curious but it's so hard to convey tone over text! 😊)
You still reached your goal so congrats!! :)
Same for me. 5th grade, they came out of nowhere and they have never been perky! :(
Another 2 pound drop for me! I'm really in love with how the graph on my loseit app keeps heading downward. :))) If I stay this course I'll be in ONEDERLAND by the end of the challenge so that exceeds my expectations. A very happy Friday indeed! 
I put up new videos of songs each month or so but my favorite was Leonard Nimoy singing about bilbo baggins. \n\nhttps://youtu.be/AGF5ROpjRAU from 1967. :)
Yeah girl, you got to work on yourself esteem! (Trust me I know how hard that is, join us over on r/LoseIt for some help from those of us trying to descend down the scale numbers so that it starts with a 1 😉) If he's repeatedly asking, you should totally at least try it! 
The thing I've learned, in the almost 17 years, since high school, is that friendships change and fluctuate. Much like you, yourself change. Some people will be in your life forever and some for just a few short years/months. 
I'm actually heading to my Zumba class here in a bit! It is so much fun!!! I'm about to hit Onederland but I've been dancing since I was in the high 250s. Just make modifications and keep moving. Messing up isn't that big of a deal, no one is watching you, they are focused on themselves or the instructor. Just get into it and enjoy the way your body moves! Seriously so much fun! :)))
Awe r/wholesomemes is leaking again! Yay! Saw this there this morning and then the r/askreddit thread and now here! \n\nSpread the word! https://www.reddit.com/r/wholesomememes/comments/5tq583/spread_the_word/?st=IZ4DYMV4&sh=9e5e52a2
😂 Hahahahahaha this made me actually LOL, I love this! :)
4 Agreements by Don Miguel Ruiz. Incredible book for understanding those around you and yourself.
You're overloaded, and understandably so! I get how eating good whole foods makes you're body feel better than the greedy easy stuff but right now you just need to focus on controlling what you can, which is where CICO would do you really well. Download the LoseIt app (most on this sub use MYFitnessPal) and start logging. \n\nAs far as gym time goes, that may be out of the question for a while for your financial situation but there are thousands of videos on YouTube that can get your body moving. I'd suggest yoga for you, because of the meditation aspect of it, especially while you are single parenting it for a while. \n\nPS side note from my friends with kids: they love the gyms with daycares because the kids get to socialize & exposed to things that make their immune systems very strong in the long run and the parents get to focus on themselves for an hour or two!! 
Yep I'm the same way, ghost me and I block your number. Makes life simpler knowing that I won't have to interact with an immature ghosting dude again. :)

Oh. Well then go to your local shop and ask questions. ;) Seriously, those people are so knowledgeable and never make you feel weird for having questions. I get that it can be nerve wrecking to walk into a place, but it seriously is so much better to talk to a live person about these things. \n\nAlso this is your penis, it turning purple doesn't sound fun for either party, and lasting damage is an issue! So you'll want to make sure your not messing up your future sex life. :)))
Seriously such a great show! Although I've loved all Aaron Sorkins' work, he's absolutely amazing and I wish his characters were real. 
I believe it comes from episode of [Silcon Valley](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2575988/) and if I'm right, then it was Erlich who said 'Fleventy Five' as the answer. \n\nIf it wasn't this episode then I'm not sure and your answer is probably correct. Haha
[4 Agreements](https://www.goodreads.com/work/quotes/376130-the-four-agreements-a-practical-guide-to-personal-freedom-a-toltec-wis) by Don Miguel Ruiz. 
Eh in my experience, do it a little during a BJ and you'll get a very fun expression/reaction, but then go back to just regular. It's fun to mix it up! :)
Ooooh narrating out loud, that's an excellent tip! :)
What a fun NSV! Congrats and keep playing! :)
Yeah with the average life expectancy rising because of science, I believe we need to have a dementia check for our presidential candidates. Not sure it would have stopped the Mango Mussolini from getting elected, but going forward we need that! 
I don't know what the other comment was but here's an upvote for 'it's incredibly common.' Haha
I wish I could give you gold for this comment. Especially for this part: \n\nThis depressed, snappy and frankly boring person is also the loving, funny sweet person you are in love with. It's not two personalities - it's one person who is overcoming a personality injury. 
That was wonderful, now I'll be looking to read more of his letters, thanks. :) 
Oh my gosh that's horrible! Why the hell wouldn't they just want to take the parts that are a problem out??? I hope that you eventually find a doctor without their head up their bums, and can get that taken care of! 
Thanks! :) I'll be in the U.K. For three of the weeks so I can't join this next one, but I'll for sure be participating again in the future! 
I think the word "friend" should also be in quotation marks, because that sounds like a terrible friend. I'm sorry you have that person in your life. 
Well hopefully this time around you can get a better grip on that fierce mental battle and find new pathways to healthful eating! I've learned a lot from this sub so I hope that you can too! You deserve to get to your goal! 
This sub is amazingly supportive. So many wonderful people all in it together! If you have any questions the stickied FAQ is a great place to start. Good luck on your journey! :)
Way to stop a complete backslide! You made a calculated decision not to gain it all back, congratulations! :)))
Oh wow, thanks for the the heads up! 
Yeah those self esteem issues, that some comfort with food, are hard to overcome when coming back down the scale. \n\nWe all deserve to get to our healthy weight goals! 
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zodiac_Killer :)
I have such a crazy amount of respect for that guy! If you haven't read it yet I highly suggest his [book](American on Purpose: The Improbable Adventures of an Unlikely Patriot https://www.amazon.com/dp/0061998494/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_api_CdzUybY7V47JF) though the audio version is incredible!! So really I'm suggesting that. Haha. \n\nAnd you're right, I remember that speech from back then, and it really resonates. 
Why would doing her hair and having cool earrings be a waste of time? 
Oh my gosh I'm hopeful that tomorrow my scale starts with a 1, I'm so close! But I know if it doesn't this week, it will next (baring any plateaus) week! It's getting super exciting! :))) \n\nCongrats to you on the 11 pounds this year, that's awesome! :)
You look great! If you're not already, you should subscribe to r/loseit and maybe join a team challenge, next one opens on the 17th I think. It's a great way to keep motivated, knowing there are 100+ people holding that you keep losing 2 pounds a week, to help your team win! 
Ooooh I think that's really great advice. Using that in the future, thanks. :) 
Yay for getting miles in while spending time with your love! :)
I weigh in every Friday and put it in my LoseIt app. I really like seeing the graph go down every week in little 2 pound drops. :)
Does anyone have his twitter handle??? I want to tweet him, this democrats support of his decision to FINALLY look into the Russian issues!!! \n\nPS yes I could look it up but I'm being lazy. Haha\n\nEdit: it's ‪@RepWalterJones ‬:)
Oh I live in a town with a river that runs through it and all the raft guides call them 'divorce boats' because of all the fights they cause in established couples. But I actually think, if you're outdoorsy, that as a first/third date it would be a real way to see how, as a couple, you handle stress, communication and fun together. 
Drink a bunch of water. You'll probably have to get up in the night to pee, but it should stop hunger pangs. How much after 9pm are you going to bed? 
Oh I just read or other comment saying your SO initiated them, so clearly he enjoys it! It will probably be a part of your sex life for the duration of your relationship. :)
What I expect to see in Trek are Starfleet Officers who are gay/straight/muslim/jewish/white/black/green...whatever and they all get along because Fox News does not exist in the 23rd century. \n\nBut the issues we are dealing with today:\nDangerous man in the white house \nReligious conflicts \nTransgender issues \nGun Violence \nMedia \nthose should be issues that our crew faces as they encounter these alien cultures that don't seem so alien after all 
 this will be a fight for the next decade.  
I read all these comics and this is what Star Trek fans should be all about.  It was mostly respectful and just allowed people to think about things and debate in a logical manner with a dash of imagination.  
They didnt have to stop every half hour so someone could go pee.  
Riverhead The Aquarium.  You get Penguins at your wedding.  Penguins !!!!!!
LOL.  I am an addict: \nGotham, Supergirl, Timeless, Flash, Arrow, Legends, Big Bang Theory, American Mom, The Real ONeals, Top Chef, Project Runway, The Goldbergs, Speechless, Daily Show, Pure Genius, Samantha Bee, Good Place, Mom, Life in Pieces, Scandal, Bobs Burgers, Madame Secretary, Modern Family, New Girl, This is Us, Plus a few more that come and go (Walking Dead, Teen Wolf, Doctor Who, Shameless, Silicon Valley, Game of Thrones....).  The way I do it is that I am old and my spouse and I tend to be home bodies who after a day at work just curl up on the couch and watch tv while cuddling 
I will watch this, even though I recently reached my Big Bang Limit and have given up on the show.  \n\nI can see so much potential in a young man who lives his life by science and logic living in a world ruled by myths.  
I got it and some of the stories are really sweet and well told.  Its a good purchase.
I think I re read this about 5 times.  I am so sorry that you are feeling this way.  \nI guess my questions for you would be: can you articulate to your parents why you are depressed?  Do you understand it yourself?  \n\nI was a parent once and the hardest thing about navigating teenagers is trying to be patient and trying to understand them.  Giving non answers, being moody, sulky, not understanding the issues can be very frustrating for a parent and some just decide its a phase or that the kid needs tough love.  Some parents feel that they should be parent of the year for just doing the basics (food, roof over your head and some spending money).  \n\nSo if you cannot tell your parents whats going on, use this forum to just get it out (if you can).  What puts a smile on your face, what do you want to change in your life.  What gets you through the day?  
no.  that is silly, but blowing a red light and causing damage and possibly death because you cannot wait another minute is different. 
They did not charge you enough.  Maybe next time you will just slow down at the red and wait the minute for the light to change.  I hope they increase the tickets to $300, then maybe people will take red lights seriously.  
This fantastic advice and I am now looking into a dash cam
I hope your right, but looking at the Republican party and how easily manipulated Americans are, I have a feeling that Trump would have a 72% approval rating for any war that was the result of an attack on American soil.  Then years later people will ask "oh what was I thinking."\n
I enjoyed issue 1.  Cannot wait for 2nd issue \n
I do not think its "dumb" for the people worried about their marriages.  Of course the Supreme Court votes on a number of issues, but typically if you are a liberal person you want someone on the court that will look at all issues through a liberal eye.  In that matter a liberal person on the courts will not only vote in keeping marriage, but chances are will also vote in other areas that liberal people agree on.  
I wake up.  Go to work at a nonprofit and sleep well knowing perhaps I made the world a little better at the end of the day. 
Make it So
I gave up during the original story arc and have now started up again with Timeless.  I am hoping I enjoy it.
I do not believe a single thing that comes out of Trump's mouth and even If I did, he is not all powerful.  Republicans can make plenty of inroads when it comes to removing gay rights without anything ever touching his desk.  \n\nEvery gay and lesbian person should be writing a letter to all their elected officials and putting it in the mail asking for their help in defending our rights.  
There are several and they are really good.  Here is a link to what you should download \n\nhttp://memory-beta.wikia.com/wiki/Voyager_relaunch
everyone is busy inventing their own apps.  I just plan on buying a huge snow blower before the next storm.  
I gave Trevor Noah almost 6 months and found that I was not enjoying him or some of the new people on the show.  I understood he needed to get his feet wet and learn as he went.  \n\nI have been tuning in since 2017 began and its slightly more enjoyable, but I do not see the passion there.  It feels like he doesn't have any skin in the game.  I get much more from Samantha Bee, John Oliver and Bill Maher 
With Russia playing a more villainous role in American politics I would love to see Red Star defect the the USA and explore the culture and political clashes 
I came out in 1987 and most would not know I am gay by everyday conversation.  I have found that 98% of my interactions with people have always been positive when it came to gay and lesbian issues.  I am searching my brain and its hard to find any negative comments or experiences.  This could also be because I was raised in NYC, then moved to Austin Texas (very liberal) and then moved back to NYC 
Hugs.  Hopefully you will work through the pain.  \n\nHow we deal with death is at least as important as how we deal with life.\n-James Kirk, \nStar Trek II: The Wrath of Khan
I think that for me.  Yesterdays Enterprise sums up how I feel about America today.  I feel like I am Guinan looking at Trump and saying "Your not supposed to be here.  This feels wrong."   \n\nI think Picard would just say to Trump, sorry but your a blip in the timeline, I am just going to slingshot around the sun and sort this all out.  Don't worry you will still be rich and Melania will once again be happy. 
after reading the one shot, I would love to see him in a new series.  
I am not a fan of my current doctor.  He has not come off as educated on gay and lesbian issues.  But he is in my network and close to my work/home route.  \nI would love to see medical personal get training on LGBT issues especially in the case of people transitioning.  NY state is currently working on a DSRIP program to reduce emergency room attendance by 25% over the next 3 years and one of the ways they are doing it is outreach to the LGBT community and trying to understand their needs and how they want to be addressed.
I think I stopped at season 4.  \n
Didnt they kill Bart Allen as the Flash once?  
Its not just fans that hate on Enterprise.  You can read "Making of Star Trek 50 Years part 2" and they have a whole section on the Writers, Show runners and actors who just hated what was coming out on a creative level.  \n\nThe Suliban are forgettable.  The Xindi storline and 9/11 season 3 arc was badly done.  Time war?  blah.  I LOVE Scott Bakula but his Captain Archer was wooden and all over the place.  The Finale was vomit worthy.  Season 4 had the best stories out of the whole series, but by then the writing was on the wall.  Still I enjoy maybe 20 episodes from the show and for those 20 episodes I thank all involved.  \n
Why are attorneys mixed up in the home buying process? I have bought 3 houses in other states and was able to close quickly (within 1 month) and cheaply.   I recently purchased a home on Long Island and the attorney was a bottleneck.   When I asked my bank while we were looking at 60-90 days to close (took 72 days) they told me that since the Lawyers got involved to get a "piece of the action" things have slowed down and become much more expensive.
I didnt laugh at all the first episode.  Wonder if I should give this another shot, or maybe it is just not for me.  
I am 100% digital.  So this makes me super happy.  
I was a brand new Trekkie at the time TNG aired.  I had just seen my first Trek movie a few months ago and was busy consuming all things Trek related.  Being a young teen, I thought season one was awesome at the time.  I remember not enjoying season two as much, but as I was hitting 18 and season 3 was starting I think both myself and the show found a sort of maturity and was able to keep growing and evolving.  I never thought it would get cancelled, but people at the comic book stores would spend hours tearing apart episodes and claiming TNG a failure and that Kirk and Spock only was real Trek 
I agree, it was a fantastic read.
The Federation.  With their root beer and subjecting the Alpha Quadrant to war instead of just closing the wormhole and leaving the Dominion to itself.  bad Federation.....BAD  
 a new reader might be able to answer this question.  I have been reading since 1982 and I can say that all these changes have just left me lost and reading a small group of titles.  I will say I am enjoying the new Superman series.  Flash series, both Titans and Teen Titans.  
Just moved from Queens to Long Island and our main goal was to be within walking distance to the LIRR.  It took us several months but finally found something that was slightly over a half a mile away.  On bad days my spouse drives me and on good days I walk. 
Wow.  Sorry all shows aren't about white heterosexual people like they were for 60 years.   I think producers, writers and actors understand that America is a diverse place and people want to see that diversity on television.  Might I suggest avoiding Star Trek and maybe watching I Dream of Jeannie or Bewitched?  There will be no diversity shoved into your face on those shows.  
Just moved to Long Island a week ago and was sad that no kids were knocking on my door wanting to shovel my house for $$$.  Finally got my lazy ass out the door at 4pm to do it myself.  No idea snow could be so heavy LOL 
This will be an opportunity for Republicans to try and introduce legislation to block democrats from voting in 2018.
being mean to Data was like kicking a baby.  You just don't do it.  
For me its sometimes the imbalance between good story telling and some action.  Numerous times in TNG, DS9, VYG, and ENT there are scenes of crew members just lightly jogging towards or away from Danger.  The exception was maybe the TNG episode where the Crystalline entity is destroying a planet and Riker and some colonists are running for their lives.   \n\nIn the new Kelvin movies, you really get a sense of urgency and action, it gets your blood running when you see Sulu, Kirk, Spock or whoever just balls to the walls running.  
Huh?  no idea what you are saying.  Wrong post.
I am part of a gay geek trivia team.  Great way to meet people.  I watch Teen Wolf...for the stories.   I also got involved in Politics and met plenty of gay people there.  I have been with the same guy since 1999, so I dont have any advice on dating apps except to say: Do not give out your phone number till you have met someone a few times and decided they are not insane.  My friend had to get a new number because he had too many people stalking him.  
But this craptacular version did not.   I never saw a version where Rip Hunter donned a trench coat and played a one dimensional version of a B 1930s detective. Nor have I ever seen a Time Bubble on Steroids like the wave rider.  So yes, Rip Hunter the character has been around for a while, but this re-imagined version of him has only been around for a year or so .
True.  I just would love to ssee the Powerless team go:\n\nman:wait? Who did all this damage?\nwoman: the no face guy.  ummm the Riddler or Question?  \nman: The Riddler is over in Gotham.  Must be the Question?  Wait how does a man with no face cause all this damage?\nwoman: I think the more important Question is "How does a guy with no face, see, breath or eat".  \nman: point.  So he is just called THE question \nwoman: yeah, like THE Doctor\nman: Doctor Who? \nwoman: yeah like the show\nman: what? wait? so The Doctor is fiction and the Question is real.  \nwoman: yeah.  its all confusing, I am so glad they allow drinking on this job\nman: wah?  pretty sure they dont 
After our next war, I expect we will have such amazing technologies like the: Wheel and Fire 
Someone might have also punched a Uterus wall, creating the child.  
It was the strongest pilot in my opinion.  I loved the premise and the characters.  The opening with the Borg and Sisko losing his wife was just well done.   This is my favorite Trek series and I think the show knew what it was and what it wanted to be right from the start.  
Regardless if it is a holiday or not, my office takes the day off to celebrate the peaceful transition of power. We urge all to use this day to get out and vote.  Maybe if more companies did this, then the government would follow and make it a holiday.  Perhaps everyone here can float the idea to the company they work for.  It does wonders for employee morale  
wow.  As someone new to Long Island and the snow, I had no idea this subject inspired such passion in people.  
I thought it was awesome.
Hopefully my own experiences can help you out.\n1) each resume and cover letter you send out has to be tailored to that job.  Look at their website and make specific comments about their company or the industry.  Maybe you are already doing it, but I know that after 65 applications, it must start to be draining.  \n2) Social Media.  I have my current job after moving to a new city and being unemployed for two months because of someone I met on Facebook.  I went to a group called unemployed New Yorkers and we would all talk about what we were looking for and give each other support.  One person knew someone who was working in my industry and made a connection for me.  2 weeks later I had a job.  \nI think in today's world the people getting jobs are the ones who have an in.  Make sure you have a linked in profile and go to networking events.  Force yourself to be social and outgoing.  \nMy friend found a job because he found a company he liked, searched facebook to find the person who was hiring within the company.  Waited in the lobby till he saw her.  Struck up a conversation about life in general with her as they shared an elevator and then sent in a resume 2 days later and mentions the conversation in passing.  She thought it was a wonderful coincidence and didn't realize his "master plan". 
I'm glad, but lets get The Question to appear.  It would not cost very much for the costume and could generate many jokes or interesting scenes.    
If people think that being a SJW is terrible, those are the people that our Marvel Superheroes would be fighting against, regardless if it was Lady Thor, a Muslim Ms. Marvel or Northstar.    
This is a fun show.  I am very happy it will get a second season.   
I will echo that Destiny is a great Starting point.  
I gave up on the show after the baby.  I asked myself at the end of each episode from this season "Okay the show is over, did I laugh?"  When the answer was a consistent "no"  It was time to watch Speechless or old episodes of "Scrubs"
So bow down to him if you want, bow to him. Bow to the king of Slime, the king of Filth, the king of Putrescence. Boo. Boo. Rubbish. Filth. Slime. Muck. Boo. Boo. Boo.
Final Frontier \nEnterprise\nDreadnought/ Battle lines\nThe novelization to The Voyage Home \n 
Amazing, but I hope all these dancers plan to vote in 2018 and spend the two years prior to it contacting their elected officials and keeping engaged in the process.  
I do not pretend to understand the realities of running a country.   But through all his mistakes and his victories, I always felt that Obama was trying to do the best job he knew how.  He surrounded himself with smart people. He was respectful of the office and those around him.  He was composed and dignified.  He projected intelligence and compassion and knew when to admit he was wrong.  America is a very diverse country and you cannot make everyone happy all the time.  I am going to miss the man who attempted to leave the office and the country a little better than how he found it.   
Yeah.  It was so easy to vote in Texas due to early voting (I was in Austin, so no Texas hate please LOL) 
You might want to look into nonprofits that exist in this area like Ridgewood Bushwick Senior Citizens Council.  They will sometimes look for Meals on Wheels Drivers, Handy Men, Food prepares, and more.   
I would love that.  Always wanted to see him on screen.  Did anyone ever read the fantastic novel: Final Frontier that shows Robert April and George Kirk?  It was one of the first novels I read and I re-read it every so often to this day
well that's always a plus.  LOL.  Now we have to work on getting Harry Kim a date LOL. Those two could have started a lonely hearts club 
For me heroes in our reality might be more symbols than on the street fighting.  Let them inspire kids to read and make good choices.  Get a bunch of costumed people to walk the streets of certain areas at night promoting peace and understanding.  I think the next 2 years are going to be very tough for America, we are seeing increase in violence and a voice given to racism.  We need heroes, but I don't think we need people beating each other up on the streets.  
as a gay man, I had no hate for 7 or 9 and while her outfit did little for me, I could appreciate her beauty.   \n\nAs for Troi, I only have pity for her.  TNG had a hard time trying to understand sex appeal and beauty.  In the end even her job was outsourced to the bartender.   If I could time travel I would go back to 1986 and maybe suggest that Troi's character be turned into a first contact specialist and that she be given a real uniform and both she and crusher be allowed to use their own hair instead of wigs and extensions.   
I would be a liaison between the government and the workers trying to reduce hospital emergency room admissions by 25% Working in space is dangerous and if you have pre existing chronic conditions, you need to learn to take care of yourself so that you are not losing space dollars while sitting in an ER because your space Asthma is acting up because you are not taking care of yourself.  
LOL  I feel so sorry for him on that show, he seemed like such a one dimensional character.  The whole show felt like "What if in the 1990s America got the rights to Doctor Who "  
TNG:  Aquiel 
oh so only on Long Island do people run red lights?  Good to know.  Actually "choosing" to be a car owner is not much of a choice in the 21st century.  When you factor in family, work, taxes, rent, you will need some sort of transportation to get your from A-B.  Now the LIRR does do a fair job of going into the city, but if you live in Seaford and work in Huntington, there is no choice but to get a car.  You need a car to survive, you need a car to work, go to the store, the doctors, LI does not have a subway system or bus system that can get your from your door to point B and NYC, Brooklyn and Queens could not handle the influx of Long Islanders who no longer "chose" to be a car owner.  
No Obligation except maybe to your future self and perhaps to your family.\nI came out at 17 in 1987 to my family.  Since I was a teenager, this gave some of them weeks, months or even years to learn to understand, accept and embrace.  I fear that if I had waited till I was 23,or 40 they would be looking at this stranger asking who are you?  How could we have missed such an important part of who you are? (being loved by someone and finding someone to love is an important part in my book).  \nLet your family and friends know the real you and not some story you have fabricated to make them happy (if your parents were deadest about you being an accountant and they would just be so upset if you weren't, would you pretend to be one to make them happy?).\n\nIn the end when you are old (like me) and sitting back and looking back at life, you might ask was it the lack of obligation that made me lie to my family and friends or was it fear? \n\n
Agreed, I would have said Battles Star Galactica was in my top 20 with the first couple of seasons, but by the end of the series it dropped pretty far.   
her medical insurance denied her claim because Klingon Sex Injuries are not covered.  
I expect it will rise when we either have an attack or the US Government creates one in order to unite America around the President.  A war does wonders for a Presidents numbers in the short term 
What is going on in America can be used as fuel for many interesting Discovery scripts.  We have a country at war with itself.  Foreign powers manipulating elections, never before discussed social issues (trans people), a deadline on environmental factors that will shape how humans survive on this planet in 22nd century.  The writers are really lucky, they have the opportunity to do what Roddenbery and staff did in the 60s and really comment on so many changes in our society.   
Using that logic, can I then feel that abortion is safe?  Since the supreme court votes on other stuff than abortion stuff?   \n\n
Having Legion not tied to the Xmen is like having Enterprise not tied to Star Trek.  
I wish he had stayed longer.  While I was not a fan of 80% of the stories, I did like the actor.  I hope the next Doctor brings us some fresh new stories.  
what an odd statement to think that I was writing this on the street and not later on.  
My only hopefully helpful comment is to maybe look at a job in the non profit sector.  I have worked at several non profits and have always had co workers that border on friends and found people who really care about me.
I know some law firms, universities and non profits that are national and international.  You should look at organizations that have offices all over and maybe find a way you can continue volunteering through out your travels.  For example SAGE.org is a program that is in almost every state that helps older gay and lesbians.  Just an example.
Just seemed like a boring, lazy episode that was not thought out as well as it could have been.  I found that by that time of the series the writers were really struggling to find interesting stories.  But I dont think I have seen that episode in over a decade or so, maybe I should give it another chance.  
I am just going about my day enjoying the 32 other shows I am currently watching,  IF this show happens great.  If it gets delayed, no worries for me I am not holding my breath waiting for this show.  I am also 100% sure that I am not paying for it.  I already have a cable bill and a Netflix bill, that's all\n
I think we are overlooking that Torres was the BEST Engineer Starfleet has ever had.  Without a space dock or any normal supplies, she was able to rebuild Voyager from scratch every episode and replace missing shuttles, torpedoes and find unlimited energy.  I hope when she got home they made her an Admiral and had her teach a whole new generation of recruits her secrets 
panties are just fine.  I just don't blow red lights and offer excuses.  Have been driving for 35 years now and everyone who blows a red life has an excuse regardless of what state or city you are in.  Just be a better driver and slow down on a yellow and stop using excuses. Everyone always has a BS reason for blowing red lights.  If its icy or snowing or raining, just go slower, if you see a yellow, slow down. 
that's how he got the job, so no surprise there.  
My dad told me the original series had several people who found it too sexy (interracial kissing, dresses on the women were too revealing, skirts were too short.  And the liberal bias commenting on the Vietnam War and other issues of the 60s.  Many people he knew (mostly from his church group) found TAS too controversial.   \n\nSo maybe this Star Trek tackling the issue and attitudes of the day are not controversial but just reflective of the world we live in.  I am optimistic that Trek will comment on what is going on in today's world and make us think a while.  So maybe we will have some water cooler talk. 
I am still learning about all this.  For 45 years I have just been super happy guy but since 2015 I have been very depressed but its for very specific reasons and I just need a way to accept certain things or fix them and then I think I would be back on track.  But of course clinical depression is a whole different animal 
vague survey.  Not a fan of the man, but gave my 2 cents 
We are listening.  Its a lot for someone your age to deal with.  Adults leave you, adults disappoint you.  Video Games take you places where you are in control and have the power to make decisions.  Too much video games and you start to miss the social education your peers get that allow you to "fit in" with groups of people.  \n\nNot being able to count on people around you means that you have to have the will power, drive, intelligence, passion and energy to put it all on yourself.  Can you continue your education, get you get help for your depression, can you find work, find housing, find transportation?   Can you find someone you can trust.   \n\nYou have every right to be depressed and I hope you will have tools available to you to work past it. 
this was a painful issue to waste my money on.  I did not care for either the Voyager story or the DS9 one.
If you got rid of the time travel cold war, the Suliban, alien nazis and almost all of season 3.  I think you have an amazing show.  :-) 
Trek Geeks podcast has a see it or skip it for the Star Trek various series and they have so far done season 1 and 2 of TNG.  I think that on average they only enjoy half the episodes in each season.  \n\nFor me sometimes I will like an episode not because of the plot but because of something the episode has that is built on in future episodes.  Like in season two there is an episode that introduces Dr. Selar (played by Suzi Plaxton).  I love the actress, I love the character and for me that is an episode I will watch over and over for her scenes.   
We just did the Long Island Aquarium in Riverhead.  It was within our budget and felt we got a lot of bang for our buck..also Penguins !!!!!! 
My bad got it mixed up. The Sanders campaign hacked into the DNC data files that had Clinton's voter file list (Sanders also had his own set of voter file list on the same server) and then HE sued the DNC because the DNC server "had a glitch" that allowed his team to access Clinton's data and his feelings were hurt when the DNC suspended his access for a day.\n\nSo I was wrong the DNC never sued him over the hack, he sued the DNC over the hack his campaign did.
> only one candidate hacked the primary and then he was sued over it\n\nThe fuck?
[deleted]
Everyone calm down. The DNC Chair is not a nominee for President. \n\nThe GOP had Wormtongue and they did fine. \n\nFocus on getting actual good candidates and voters off their asses. \n
It's a shame to see the DNC chair race being just as biased as it's primary process. The clear winner of the debates last night was Pete, but thanks to votes already pledged he doesn't have any chance of getting it. The parties gonna burn to the ground under Ellison or Perez, both of which were dodging questions like Neo last night. 
The thing is this is not normal. This is an internal process that only 447 people get to vote on and while there are multiple public debates no ones really explained that the DNC chair is not an all-powerful position. \n\nPrior to this year when the DNC or RNC chair was up there was some internal debates between the voting members and in late February the party elite voted.\n\nNow we've turned it into a sideshow because TV news needs ratings
This is the only correct answer. The end of WW2 redifined everything and at best it was based on rampant propaganda, forged documents, coerced confession and shady deals. At worst it was a deblibrate move to utterly destroy Germany and purposely lead the way to mid east destabilization via Isreal lead on by a select group of behind the scenes people. 
Keep in mind, the allied army had spent years being exposed to propaganda, both via the media and official military channels. Its no suprise then that upon reaching the camps in total unsupplied disarray with many people dead that they would have no problem believing the evil nazi tale and using that to form the foundations for how they percieved everything. The end of the war was awful without a doubt, equally so for the germans and prisoners alike. Its what happened prior to the end thats up for debate and where all the lies and tall tales are held. 
Alefantis owns tons of properties. Theres no logic or shred of evidence that ties it to some pedo ring. Why isn't this buck-gate? That one has a basement! Or you know, why would they not do this sort of stuff away from prying eyes at a private residence, where you dont have to worry about the logistics of smuggling kids in and out of a busy dc restaurant? 
You should feel bad for posting such a trash video. 
So, cheese pizza used together, but not singular. Nothing for hot dog. And something with more downvotes than upvotes on urban dictionary, so its not exactly a normal thing AND doesnt relate to kids at all.
There is no way the restaurant is involved, at all. Too many regular people, waiters, bartenders etc would need to be involved. That its still such a focus of things after all this time is mind boggling. Clinton foundation, sure that makes sense. Podesta, absolutely up to something, but who knows what. James? "Evidence" doesn't even exist for this jump, just "muh instagram". And a busy pizza place in the middle of a city? For what purpose? These people have unlimited funding. Something a bit more remote seems far more likely, if anything exists at all. 
Title 4 doesn't work that way m8
Wether or not theres good or bad guys, and Syria certainly qualifies as between meh and headchoppers depending on the group, its very odd a piece praising the assassination of any foreign diplomat would be published by a major outlet. I can't imagine whats actually being planned behind the scenes in the US if we're already ro this point. 
Like everything else so far, it's nothing. So yes, perfectly safe to click
You've been watching too much infowars and glenn beck. Martial law has been claimed for 7 and half years now as a scare tactic Obama would use to stay in office, and it just ain't gonna happen. TPTB don't care at all whos in the chair, it makes a minimal difference overall. 
http://m.waff.com/waff/pm_/contentdetail.htm?contentguid=od:Vuw5PZmY\n\nMisleading story is misleading. Dudes in trouble not because he lives off the grid, but because he just went and did whatever against city codes including not even setting up a proper septic system. 
And yet there's still nothing to show for it
The sideshow that is taking place with trans people, and it's just that a sideshow, has nothing to do with being left or right. Dems policies on everything else is largely in line with Republicans, from health care to campaign finance to warmongering and tax structures. The left isnt even standing up against govt surveillance. The US currently doesn't have a left wing party, and that's a major problem. 
No you see, it has circumstantial evidence. And theres lots of it. Loads even. Just don't question it, or you're a pedo protector. 
The email server at a minimum. There's also the rather large body count
Not gonna lie, reptile people are a bit much for me. Is there more to it than that at least?
There isn't a good side to the "rebels" 
Prior to that piece Trump had already spent the day going off on Iran. Since then he's blamed Russia for Ukraine escalation (they didn't) and backed them claims of Crimea, while going off more on Iran. Trump's not being undermined by the Pentagon, he just lied like crazy about his foreign policy during his campaign. 
On the one hand, that's kind of harsh. On the other though it does make some sense. The last thing any city wants is to end up like san francisco. I'm uncertain either way how its a conspiracy however. 
No revisionist denies people died in the camps. The issue up for debate was wether it was done intentionally, or how intentionally anyways. They clearly didn't want to just kill every man woman and child (the largest part of even the Auschwitz camp by far was home to those that couldn't work), and there's no evidence to support gas chambers or death camps and especially no death vans. That said, typhus was very real and even treating against it they did know it was going to cause more casualties than had people not been put into the camp system.  They did expicitly order to try as best they could to prevent this however. \n\nThen the end of the war approached and things went totally sideways. http://www.ihr.org/jhr/v15/v15n3p23_weber.html
There's literally a gigantic list of confirmed conspiracies under the about this sub link. A notable one that didn't make the list is the overt work being done to bury holocaust revisionism. 
Nice find
This narrative needs to stop. The countries from Obama's list with a ban enacted by Trump have nothing to do with Trump's specific business interests. This is a systemic problem of regional destabilization and shady regional alliances not specific to any one candidate or party. 
"Comet confirmed the pedo connection"\n\nNo, no it did not. All its done is discredit the whole thing by people stalking and focusing on a location that doesn't even make sense to use in the first place. After weeks there's still nothing to show for comet being anything other than a pizzeria, and there never will be. 
This. They didn't have to shill nearly as hard after 9/11 as they're doing now. The question remains as to what it will lead to of course. We wont be invading Russia in this case. 
If we went to Afghanistan for Osama, then do explain why were still there with no plans of leaving anytime soon, almost 2 decades later. It's all about regional presence for corporate influence, nothing more nothing less, and is why we're now nearing close to a 1000 bases worldwide. We aren't the good guys. Quick history less for you https://youtu.be/kqwMTAPH6XE
Thats some fine clickbait there. All it does is add them to the civil rights act as a race, which means nothing on an individual level. 
It wasn't a "group". It was mostly people posting topless/nude teens of unverifiable age primarily in south america, mixed in with a large amount of pro porn and perfectly normal stuff. Apparently there was also some awful shit, but I never ran into it going down the list of so called pedos that was posted.
You would think by this time youd have something at all if it existed, but nobody does. Its still mostly just down to 1 email to podesta thats not even verifiable. 
Economic incentive for more effecient plants and such is a good thing. The sooner we pick up on renewables, the better. 
Thats literally nothing. Nobody on the other side of the street reacts, the filmer doesn't react, nothing. Its also unaffected by traffic so whatever the kid is freaking out about is on the filmers side of the road. \n\nYou guys are finding what you want to see, not whats actually there. So much effort has been wasted on this stupid restaurant instead of more possible leads like the podesta bros and the clinton foundation, especially since the latter just possibly offed someone. 
Is it drawn or painted? Then its not CP. Japan has a whole industry of that nonsense. \n\nIf anybody wants this whole pizzagate thing to go anywhere they really need to learn what cp and pedos are first at least
I think the no doxxing rule has been in effect for years if not the sites entire existenceand is not a nefarious attempt to cover up anything. Even 4chan bans for doxxing, its common practice. Stay on voat if you think its a conspiracy over here. 
That's easy, the plane, atmosphere and everything in the earths gravity field is moving relative to the earth. Thats like asking how can you walk down the aisle of a moving airplane, or rather move side to side I suppose in one. 
Simply put, it's not an invadable country, along with China and the US. Totally forgetting the nuke angle, there's too many cities, too many people and too much land mass. Besides, we haven't run out of mideast countries to attack yet v
Thats not what I was saying at all. I was stating that if all those permits and inspections didn't exist, as you seem to imply they shouldn't, that people would be cutting corners left and right. 
It is true through. The only other thing of note is the death in Haiti.
Pizzagate is 100% a circlejerk topic where anyone who wanders into a thread to disagree or raise questions gets downvoted and called a shill as they long since jumped to conclusions and will now try to fit anything as "evidence" to support that conclusion. It would be nice if they kept to /pol/ and voat but all that can be done here is avoid the threads if you dont feel like talking sense into a wall. 
They're really going all out to protect their holocaust illusions. No matter how many laws they put up it won't stop the truth though, especially now in the digital age. 
I must have missed that in the story. Pro Israeli zionists fund both side of the ballgame however. The single largest republican donor was Sheldon. https://www.opensecrets.org/outsidespending/summ.php?disp=D\n\n\nTheyre behind everything and everybody, as usual. 
Have you? There are no original gas chambers at Auschwitz. They go so far as to admit this. Everything you see there was "rebuilt" by the soviets, including the giant chimney to no where and the crude holes in the roof of the "gas chamber". 
Whats your explanation for ships over a horizon or foucaults pendulum?
Someone who should be nowhere near the DNC. 
Where on earth do you live that people won't cut every corner you let them? Have never seen the "work" of unlicensed contractors? Now not everyone would of course, but good luck telling who that would be. \n\nI'm honestly jealous of you. I wish I could still assume the world was filled with nothing but well meaning people. Its far from that though. 
Pizzagate is a joke and distracts from real issues, like us funding terrorists in Syria, sending libya back to the stone age, helping saudi destroy yemen etc. Syria especially is a lesson in propaganda, its absolutely disgusting. 
The guy wasn't simply remodeling a house. This guy bought city land, probably for cheap, then just plopped his mobile home down on land not zoned for mobile homes and jury rigged some power and "rainwater collection system". He has no well or septic even by the report. Thats just straight up not safe, and those sort of major rules exist for good reason. 
There's a lot of research thats been done to show the gross exaggeration of holocaust claims. Dachau in particular is admitted to have no gas chamber (they're now only even claimed in soviet held camps), and up until the end of the war did everything they could to maintain prisoner's health. http://codoh.com/library/document/2263/\n\nThe whole war was a tragedy, this goes without saying. Civilians on both sides died in the tens of millions. More civilians died in a night in Dresden than the entire war at Dachau. Some 9400 people died in the sinking of the wilhem gustloff, a single ship. When dealing with WW2, deaths were immense everywhere. The purpose of revisionism is to cut through the propaganda and extremely sketchy Nuremberg trials to get to an accurate picture of what really happened in the war in the camps, which turns out to not be the story thats generally portrayed. \n
And then we improved the country by maintaining minimum safety standards. Sanitation in particular isn't something to just "do what you want" with. https://www.unicef.org/media/media_68359.html\n\nEdit: I'd love to hear an explanation for how unregulated sanitation is a good thing when its killed millions of children worldwide since 2000 alone. Sanitation improvements have been one of societies greatest achievements towards preventing deaths. I doubt I get it from muh freedom downvoters however.
In the original list of 12 or so, almost all the people were south american. If there was anything in arabic that was either before or after i stopped paying attention. Mideast is a fucked up place so it wouldnt really suprise me, but I never ran into it. 
To be fair, identity politics have taken over the party. 
Thsnks for trolling I suppose
http://m.digitaljournal.com/biz/business/op-ed-us-defense-department-and-spending-on-toilet-tissue/article/364843\n\n58 million on DoD toilet paper for 2012. Sounds legit. 
Investigation would imply you haven't already come to a conclusion, which you clearly have. There is no investigation being done, but rather trying to force everything to fit a narrative you've already determined. 
Not at all. The revisionist debate is wether the Nazis had in plan a program to systematically exterminate the jews via murder. Death camps, mass killings, gas chambers etc all under a direct order from Hitler. The truth seems much more in line with it being a similar work and detainment camp system as even the US had, that suffered disease outbreaks through the war and went to shit at the end, with the main plan being throughout to contain and deport not exterminate. 
Someone is shadowbanned here too
We don't have to pick a fight, but we also shouldn't back them to the hilt like we are now. Lebanon, withheld elections aside, is arguably a better democratic model to follow for countries in the middle east. At least we're backing them too... And giving APCs to Hezbollah lol
Or, I could stay here and call out govts absolute corruption, which isn't even a partisan issue as both sides are guilty, and try and work towards exposing it and working towards a fix. Beats buying into every peice of propaganda put out and repeated ad nauseum by the news. 
According to the mystic pizzagate decoder ring all 4 words mean something sexual with kids. They must've bought it from the same place holocaust purists bought their decoder ring, in that in both cases words mean what they mean strictly because of course thats what they have to mean, even when thry dont. 
This is the correct answer. Local currency is a project that never really took off for a number of very good reasons, but it's perfectly legal as long as its taxed and not used for interstate trading. 
The ISS would crash into earth in no time if it wasn't regularly provided propulsion. I don't even have the time to go into the moon just for someone to go nuh uh. \n\nThis is the worst conspiracy theory of all time. 
There will never be a stable govt backed by the west in Afghanistan. It's not gonna happen. It's absolutely best to pull out entirely and let them sort it out. Should another ISIS rise, and its not likely, so be it. But what we're doing is just proping up an oppressive barely functional govt just so we can have bases and run pipes through there. 
I just know how to pick them. My current gf is borderline lol. 
What evidence do you have that theres anything to even investigate at the restaurant? Serious question, given whats been put out there, there's no link to CPP at all. 
It's frightening, but also hopefully just for show. Iran is very much not a country we can actually attack. They don't need nukes when their MAD condition is already in play, wherein the straight of Hormuz is closed off and gulf state oil production gets waves of missiles sent their way. I simply can't see it passing. The entire world economy would collapse into deep recession with sky high oil prices. 
What are tides for 1000 Alex
There won't be a world war because major world players currently can't be invaded and are all armed to the teeth with nukes. There isn't a scenario where the US could launch a campaign against Russia, or vice versa. 
Russia loves Israel as much as the US. It's I think the only non exSoviet country where Russian is a major language, as there's a lot of Russians that fled there since it's founding. 
Foucaults pendelum proves the earth moves 
Iran is "the largest state sponsor of terrorism" on technicalities. Large parts of their official budget get dumped into Hezbollah and their own IRGC. At worst, neither of these should be classed the same as AQ and IS, and in my opinion both qualify as legitimate political and military forces. \n\nKSA and the gulf states don't funnel money directly from their budget as a line item for AQ and IS. Most of it goes through private donors and shady shifting of funds like our cia uses to fund moderate rebels around the world. That's how they get away with such a completely bullshit claim without getting called out for it by even the most pro govt media. 
We got to russia being more evil than terrorists awfully quick
Or you know, fake photos are as old as war itself. \n\nhttp://vho.org/GB/Books/dth/fndgcffor.html\n\nAnd media today is filled with fake reports with actors all the time\nhttps://youtu.be/blg9XVBUEZg\nhttps://youtu.be/WWBdU32-o98\n\n
Its like a conspiracy in and of itself. "Insert Inception music here"
Or you could quit attacking an innocent restaurant and focus on the parts your "investigation" that have at least some basis in reality. The whole comet angle does nothing but reinforce the publics idea that yall are a bunch of madmen. 
I did say mostly. The entire pedo thing is based on a pizza related map. People dieing while looking into clinton afairs doesn't have to be pedo related at all, and is rather par for the course. I don't doubt Podesta and the clinton foundation are up to no good.. Doesnt change the fact theres no evidence though. 
The worst part of it all is what its doing to rural families, leaving children alone for years on end with grandparents since you can't transfer schooling or medical care if you move. One of the better RT documentaries covered it. 
Thats pretty clearly another guy calling James that, not the baby. Much like the first pic in the thread is just a gay guys halloween after hours event, hence the fake blood. I'm all for a good conspiracy, but the more this garbage gets posted the more I'm certain there's nothing here with this guy at all. \n\nThe weirdest thing is that everyones focused on him while the clinton foundation gets away with murder and podesta goes practically unmentioned. Its almost like a planned move by someone to throw out a fall guy while the real issues get buried again. 
Many people died in that situation of poor sanitation, and continue to do so to this day. I for one am glad the US isn't India. Odd that my post defending clean living has been modded out. 
Normally I would say this is false to stir up russian contoversy, but it being a russian defector and all... Russia never have taken kindly to those. 
Even if global warming is wrong, and it may or may not be, that doesn't change the fact that the regulations its spawned are good. The smog in the 80s alone was absolutely disgusting. Imagine how much worse it would be with the extra population over the last 30 plus years.  
Why is it only a problem when Russia does it? Israel is by far the largest single backer of american politics but nobody ever cries foul about that while they run an apartheid state. 
https://www.opensecrets.org/overview/topindivs.php\n\nThe top republican donor is also fervorishly pro isreali, Sheldon Aldeson. Haim is actually pretty far down the list of influencial donors. Its no suprise Israel plays both sides as hard as possible however. 
Even if james is guilty of something (and you have way less on him than the podestas or clinton foundation) he owns more property than just a pizza restaurant. Theres never been a reason to link a pizza place staffed by probable normies to a child predator ring,nor does it make any sense. 
"RT, the russian propagana network" its like someone let John Kirby himself write an article. \n
50%, and then only used together in the form of cheese pizza, aka CP. Hotdogs were never used, and pasta was and is a reference to copypasta, nothing pedo about it at all. 
That was just an example. Do name a regulation thats come from this that you would consider bad however. 
And this comment shows how the US can lie time and time again and people buy it hook line and sinker. Take this statement: https://twitter.com/USEmbassyTurkey/status/814047584998330368\n\nAnd yet we have both troops and equip helping ypg, and theres been videos of them using javelins. Plus this: http://www.businessinsider.com/kurds-ally-with-syrian-arabs-say-that-us-arms-are-on-the-way-2015-10\n\nThe US govt isnt a trusted source of anything these days without verifiable evidence. 
Thank you for proving my point. 
This. When will it end
Its simply amazing the atrocities they get away with daily that would see any other nation sanctioned into irrelevancy if not outright invaded. 
Airplane travel completely debunks flat earth. Why is this even a thing?
Aside from terrible foreign policy including Benghazi, the Clintons have been surrounded by the largest number of suicides and heart attacks of any politicians I can think of. Seth Rich and Monica Peterson are just potentially the latest on a very very long list. But surely its all just a coincidence.  
You should look into revisionism thats been fairly well backed up by both documents and physical evidence, as well as look into the sham that was Nuremberg and the surrounding trials. Key evidence still held today like the Hoess testimony were documented to be coerced, the gas vans are backed up by a known mossad collaberating mazi agent, many documents have been proven forgeries from stalin era Russia etc. \n\nDid camps exist? Yes. Did they exist to kill millions off the books, not a chance. 
Katy Gannas (i assume thats the one from a quick search) art is no more CP than photos of nudists. Him and his brothers art tastes are absolutely a red flag combined with everything else, but they aren't CP. If people want this to be taken seriously at all, people need to know what the hell they're actually looking for. I almost don't blame the media for laughing at the "investigation"
Thats different. In that situation its normal for the priests and such to be left alone with kids, and then bad shit happens. To use this restaurant theyd have to smuggle kids in and out every time, they cant really be stored there. So why take the risk to use the restaurant at all? Its an unnecessary step in the whole thing, and hasn't made sense since day 1. 
Nobody cares if you live off the grid m8. You still have to follow building permits even if you use your own power and water, which is in no way a bad thing as a whole. 
The answer is gravity and physics though m8.\n\nI think the better question would be if the earth is flat how are we able to travel around it daily. Wheres the edge?
There's still loads of gravity at the ISS
It depends on the subject matter, but generally it is. And when it isn't, its usually really obvious. They've been doing good work in Syria though, much better than our propaganda machines. 
Yep that's exactly what it was. This country is a mess
I know DeVos is just Amway's consolation prize, but I always thought the school voucher idea wasn't irrational. I'm not saying that it's superior to public schools, but simply that it isn't crazy - like the border wall or anything like that.\n\nAre there data out there that shows that vouchers are, in fact, irrational? 
*Perez, who was encouraged by Obama administration officials to run for the post, has emerged as the apparent front-runner, with independent Democratic strategists tracking him at about 205 votes. But it’s not yet clear whether Perez or Ellison — or one of six other long-shot candidates — is positioned to capture the required majority of the 447-member national party committee.*\n \n*The strategists spoke on condition of anonymity because many DNC members they track do not want the vote count discussed publicly.*\n \n*Ellison, backed by Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders and his supporters, has the support of about 153 members, the strategists said. Ellison spokesman Brett Morrow blasted the count as “totally inaccurate” and said his camp remains “incredibly confident.”*
[#11 is that he Refuses to Support a Ban on Corporate Money and Lobbyists](https://theintercept.com/2017/01/18/tom-perez-dnc).
I have to admit Keith is my preference because Bernie likes him, and because he was [one of the first to take Trump seriously.](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=FHkPadFK34o)\n\n[TYT also saw it early](https://youtu.be/OJb7xUXM_-8) as well when he polled at 25% republicans, and upped their %chance of winning accordingly.
Even fewer progressives believe in free press
The hot shot sunbean, on Amazon for example could work. Based off reviews it's cheap and okay. \n\nI've never done what I suggested above, but it should help fix the time consuming process of boiling water
Mad King II?
Yes, Bronn (he slipped my mind somehow)
My recommendation is to get a hot water dispenser and an AeroPress. \n\nAeroPress is quick and hot water dispenser can give up hot water instead of having to boil your own. 
I increased the water temp to 208, and it was much better. \n\nToday I'll try right off the boil
Great!! Time to pick one up
In a exaggerated case:\n\nFew blacks in a town, and store owners (market) "ban" them. The next market is 5-10 miles away. The rest of the town save a few others aren't interested/don't/care about the discrimination\n\nPeoples right to buy (> ? <) Peoples right to sell
What's wrong with it. It could be better, but it's not bad. 
Total Brew time?\n\nI use 25/26g of coffee in my 6-c and my slurry takes 90+ secs to finish dripping 
Interesting, very interesting I've noticed my coff has gotten worse after switching to my new temp.var kettle\n\nI'll try a higher 208/209 brew temp\n\nThanks!
I'll try this today
So if I understand correctly if I use finer grind size I need to increase my brew time\n\nI currently use 34g:505g for 4min
That's the point. \n\nIf you are referring to the different radiuses/diameters, their size is meaningless. The only purpose for changing those is to help spread the data. \n\nEdit:\n\nBrazil: May-ish --> August-ish\n\nKenyan: October-ish -->December-ish
My slurry never dries, it has taken me ~200-230 to pour ~400g of (this includes my ~30sec/55g bloom)\n\nThanks for the reply!
Thanks again!\n\nSo it do a good job highlighting the coffees specific flavors? Or does it it make certain coiffed shine more than others?
Typo, it normally takes from 230-400 to finish dripping ~150/200g of water
I have most recently doing AeroPress in the morning and Evening 
I read this differently. I suspect Trump just found out he was being wiretapped by federal law enforcement with valid warrants during the campaign. He immediately and falsely blamed Obama.
> (Speaking of deranged and violent, guess my comment triggered some Trazi lurker troll...lol. Sad.)\n\nLots of weird upvotes/downvotes and trolling right now from "those people." Like their idol, lots of unfocused online rage today.
They pick up on their master's mood swings, like dogs.
He knows damn well it's bullshit, he just doesn't care.  That's what fascists are: If a lie fits the hatred they feel, then they believe it, period - reality must bend to their Will to Hate.  But because it won't, they just get more and more deranged and violent.\n\n(Speaking of deranged and violent, guess my comment triggered some Trazi lurker troll...lol.  Sad.)
