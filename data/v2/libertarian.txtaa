What are housing and real estate prices like in your area? If these homeless people wanted to homestead land, build\\buy a house, or rent an apartment, what is their cheapest option?
In my area, we have a huge number of tiny nonprofits doing amazing work is crazy.
Wait, so is cutting hair in Arizona without a license illegal?

A misleading title on Reddit...nah don't believe it 
Infected dirt...\n\n
So private groups making homeless peoples' lives better makes government's job harder. Oh no, the horror. Maybe government should be better at its job.\n\nEDIT: I think my sentiment has been misinterpreted. I'm saying the government's incompetence at fulfilling its self-stated mission of providing for its subjects' lives should not preclude private individuals from helping each other.

Don't the homeless struggle with enough health problems as it is?  Now they'll be at risk of [catching a bad coif](https://jeromiewilliamsdotcom.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/donald-trump-bad-hair-photo-1.jpg?w=558).
You're on /r/Libertarian, comrade.  That kind of talk is dangerous around here.
Ask your government to fix the foster care system. Almost every homeless person was in it at one point in time. Just another govetnment failure. People try to put a bandaid on homeless adults, but the problem starts much earlier. Dig deeper, grasshopper.
Everyone, please use AmazonSmile to donate to the Institute for Justice. They are awesome.
Because then they can add a tax to pay for the program instead.
Exactly. The government doesn't want problems to be fixed too much as a lot of their votes decrease without their empty promises.  Look at Obama. He made great promises you could believe in and did not deliver anything between 2008-2012 so that he could run again and reuse them.  All he did there was claim that it wasn't enough time to turn the Bush train around.  He wore it proudly that he was a champion of the people, but he was a total phony.  Haven't seen the current guy do anything I can't point to in this was as he's been there a month.
Why is it that anytime someone tries to do something nice for the homeless, some "*governmental body*" steps in and applies business codes to humanitarian efforts?  \n  \nHelping *each other* is what we're supposed to be doing!  God forbid somebody get something that didn't come from the government or a multi-million dollar foundation/charity.
Wait, you mean we don't need some overbearing, leviathan state to help others? That can't be right.
he didnt overrule the board though, he only asked they stop their nonsense
money?
Don't need police to respond to trespassing on private land.  Just a shotgun.
How else are they supposed to sell tickets to the mandatory yearly donation drives? 
that's awesome.. do you know of a way to find these organizations? I'd like to help
America needs to stop tolerating this. **There need to be punishments for authoritarian government's infringements on civil rights.**          \n\nGovernment *has no legitimate right to tell people when and where and by whom they can cut their hair.* That is only legitimate in authoritarian governments. Abusing citizen's basic rights for profit has no legitimate place in a democracy.         \n\nProtecting our rights and liberties **is the basic premise of government.** If I infringe on your rights I am most likely criminally liable. There needs to be punishment for this to put an end to this crap in 2017.  
This is what I took from the article as well.  I was wondering if I had missed something.  It seems that the title is a bit misleading on this one.
I imagine even if you privatized it, that would't change much seeing as right now the police can barely respond to it. It isn't like just a few people, it is near 100. 
That is most DEFINITELY true.
Without government, [who would arrest people for helping the less-fortunate?](http://www.cltampa.com/news-views/local-news/article/20848403/tampa-activists-arrested-for-feeding-the-homeless)
Couldnt he pardon them?
More like under-fund the actual activists and then use that money hiring their friend's companies to provide the tables, plates, and food.  \n  \nIt seems most of government these days is designed to turn public wealth into private capital.
I was thinking that the gov may have authority over certain administrative charges much like the president does over certain agencies. Not sure of the jurisdiction of that though.
They don't have to do anything. \n\nPolice let people go with a warning all the time.
For all the shit that Trump is taking (seemingly from everyone) even some of his critics have stated that he walked in the door "attempting to make good on his campaign promises."  \n  \nI believe one of the CNN headlines was "Trump does exactly what he said he was gonna do"  and then of course continue to trash talk what he was doing...  but I digress.  \n  \nYeah, Obama was shit.  So many things got so much worse under the last 8 years.
While there are a large number of homeless that live on our trails.
It's not making the government's life harder.  It's making the people's lives harder and endangering public safety......which is bad for business in general.
Well, I mean, you could...
The government allows nonprofits to be involved in the care of children, but it still runs the program. I never said charity couldn't handle it. But, you can't jump that hurdle without fixing the government problem first. By government problem...I mean them stepping out of the way and allowing charity to step in. 
What a legend this man was. Built the foundation that made America great and capable to conquer the world. [Compare him to the cucks of today.](https://files.catbox.moe/sa27od.jpg) 
They should take a note from Texas: http://www.activistpost.com/2015/12/well-armed-activists-openly-defy-texas-law-to-feed-the-homeless-hundreds-clothed-and-fed.html\n\n>The event went off without a hitch, even after code enforcers showed up. Lead organizer of the event, Murdoch Pizgatti was confronted by the enforcers who told him to file the proper paperwork upon the event’s conclusion to which, Pizgatti politely replied, “no.”\n\n>“We’ve already had to speak to the police, they’ve already come and delivered code to us,” said Short, explaining what happened when the code enforcers showed up. “But, after shaking hands with them, they realized we’re all armed – and we’re gonna do what we’re gonna do because it’s not an immoral thing that we are doing.”
Dude...this govenor is based.
If you wish for the trails to be enclosed, would you support allowing the homeless people who are reportedly already there to homestead the land and build private dwellings upon it in order to keep the hikers out?
Yea, people can make up some really stupid regulations.
A church near me owns around 5 acres or so of land and was trying to put some mobile "tiny homes" on their property. The neighbors were putting up signs that had "Tiny Homes" with a red circle and slash. They weren't against tiny homes, they were against the church housing undesirables right next to them.\n\nThere was also a beach community not too far away that had protested the building of a homeless shelter. \n\nIt's easy to try and make the homeless someone else's problem.
It really is the government, and not the police. They could maybe choose to ignore it happening, but if it's called in there is little they can do. They are just here to enforce the crazy ass regulations someone engineered to fuck everyone gently but turn a crazy profit.\n\nI wonder how many regulations were put in place only because someone saw profit in the situation it created.
Charity, particularly eleemosynary measures, died when government tried to force it. 
Food Not Bombs often feeds homeless around Tampa and weekly in St Petersburg. Tampa PD only did something about it in this instance because the park was going to host an Usher concert later on due to the NCAA championship game.\n\nIt doesn't make the interfering any better at all, but it does mean that the group typically can do their thing without harassment which is nice
It's unlikely a gub has the authority to waive fees or grant licences.
I feel warm and fuzzy where my belly button is but deeper and all over!\n\nBut seriously this is no brainer let them get the haircuts.\n\nGovernment: "But how are we gonna identify them and run them out of town?"
Correct me if I'm wrong but if somebody were to call it in they have no choice but to take legal action if the law is being broken.\n\nIf they didn't it i feel like it would undermine the fact they are keepers of the law, and not interpreters of it.
I feel like that the more local the governing body is, the more they want to micromanage things. 
>that live on our trails. \n\nPrivatize, boom hellfire missile for those trespassing /s on the second part. 
While there are a large number of possible early causes, more proximate causes for homelessness might be lack of freely available land to homestead, high housing prices, and local government regulations and restrictions designed to discourage the construction of low cost housing.
So why isn't charity taking care of it? You say it is a government problem, where is the private solution? Or is it because we cannot make massive profits from selling children? 
What do you suggest we do about a country that is already interfering in our elections?
I work for a nonprofit community foundation and the number of tiny nonprofits doing amazing work is crazy. They don't take government money, they run on shoe-string budgets and they change people's lives. It's truly amazing.
It isn't like just a few people, it is a government problem, where is the private solution?
I am Libertarian, but the government is the problem here. What they will and won't allow charity/nonprofits to handle is the problem.
It's the government refusing to allow low-income housing. I could build a profitable low-income housing area for $200 per month. Full utilities, showers, bathrooms, etc. The problem is that the city won't permit it. I'm in an extremely cooperative city too. I couldn't imagine LA or NYC. 
Tell that to Stanley Milgram...
Because the poor need to be dependent on government, can't have people going around thinking we could help the poor voluntarily! 
There's that word "public" we use the force of the state for the "public good".\n\nIf people cause you harm then they should be harmed, won't have a homeless vagrant hostility situation if individuals defend themselves.
And people wonder why I think government is evil. 
A government big enough to give you free haircuts...
Exactly how should they "be better" ?? Violate the homeless' rights by sweeping them all away into a prison or mental asylum? 
As someone who visits Tampa for business several times a year, this is blood boiling.\n\nLiterally see red when I see that.
The private solution was letting people privately cut private homeless people's private hair.\n\nEdit: I didn't realize until after I sent this that "private hair" sounds kinda funny.  Lolol
I was under the impression that federal gov law over the states is what Libertarians have issue with? Not state laws. Could someone explain or point me to a video to help my understanding. I'm assuming most aren't Ancaps. 
The answer generally (not all cases) is because it attracts more homeless to the area. In my area, we have several churches that feed the homeless. As a result, we have a huge number of homeless that live on our trails. They go to the church to eat. \n\nDuring this explosion in homeless in the area, crime for people walking along the trail has shot up. The local police now say you shouldn't walk on the public trail unless you are in a group. \n\nThere is nothing the local law enforcement can do, except encourage the residents to write to these churches. But so far that hasn't had any affect. \n\nSo the church gets to do good work, while the people pay. \n\nThat said, my city also has a homeless once a month, located in a central area where you can get haircuts, dental work, shower, etc. 
Slowly over time the system becomes more bloated and corrupted by the self-interests of people who have nothing better to do than cheat on each other.
The US supports both Saudi Arabia as well as ISIS with military capabilities and taxpayer dollars. This is fact.
Ad hominen attacks only serve to further divide. The biggest problem in America is that people are unwilling to understand the other side. Just labeling their character with negative and false accusations is nothing more than shit talking. It's not productive.
You're misunderstanding, I hope you read what I wrote again. Nothing about free market competition should support subsidized, government-sanctioned monopolies that profit off of government-private partnership schemes to devalue a nation's currency.                                \n\nFurther, libertarianism is fundamentally about liberty. It's not fundamentally about capitalism. Capitalism is fundamentally about capitalism. That misconception needs to go.              
You're right that socialism and private property do not go together. By definition, socialism is the absence of private property.           \n\nRemember though, private property and NAP are ideas to defend liberty. Liberty being the fundamental premise. One can still plausibly accept liberty as the fundamental basis of their political philosophy while, a step up from that, rejecting private property, whether right or wrong, because it *reduces liberty.* I don't agree with it. I think it's illogical. That doesn't mean I can't understand how they got to where they got to. I'd agree with them in limited circumstances. For instance, national parks.                                   \n\nNAP would go along the same line of reasoning. It cannot be a fundamental axiom of a functioning world. It would never work in reality. Absolute adherence to the NAP would not let anyone accomplish anything. You couldn't drive because that creates pollution. Industry could not exist. NAP works up to a limit where we call it reasonable to let things slide. It is not a fundamental basis of libertarianism. Liberty is the fundamental basis.  
That's *really* cool. Good job. Something so satisfying about seeing something someone built themselves when compared to gigantic RVs that you can buy out-right. Plus, it'll handle a lot better on tighter roads.
Are you sure they rigged it? What should we do to countries who interfere in our elections?
WTF? People are upvoting this? So hate crimes against Muslims or refugees are "kind of understandable" now?
>You make a lot of vague assertions and back them up with bluster. It's not my job to attempt to clarify your ramblings.                 \n\nHe is a moron. The only *embarrassing thing here for libertarians* is that he is being upvoted. He doesn't have a clue what he is talking about.                     \n\n>The Constitution allows for Congress to coin money and to regulate the value (the measures) of those coins. That makes it easier for accounting across the border, but doesn't really require a great deal of management. The Constitution didn't call for making US money legal tender, and legal tender didn't arrive until the Civil War.              \n\nThat is 100% correct. This is what people here need to be reading.
What would be cooler than flying your own plane for your after-work exercise, or a weekend trip?           \n\nI wonder really just how hard it is to fly it, though. It might not in reality be very much fun.            \n\nHowever, I also wonder if advancements in materials science and engineering could one day make these practical enough for recreational enjoyment. Something appears incredibly satisfying about the idea of flying under your own physical power.             \n
> Uh....just following your lead, man.                         \n\nThat is a lie. Never did I insult your intelligence or character until you resorted to start throwing ad hominens, saying childish stuff like "can you even read."         \n\nI don't care to read any more of what you have to say, you've already discredited yourself. You have very little in-depth understanding of monetary-, financial- or macro-economic history. Your life is invested in a career that likely directly profits off a system that derives its function from the corrupt monetary policy (alchemy) scheme which adds no value to humanity, and *your career* likely also does not add value to humanity. You've drank the cool aid. I suggest you switch careers and do something respectable with your life. Or pickup a mainstream set of intro and intermediate economics textbooks so you can at least understand the vocabulary and concepts which are used to come to the conclusion you've allegedly arrived at.                  \n\n

> As far as inflation increasing wealth, that's because there is much more debt than currency. This means that decreasing the value of debt adds more wealth to the economy than increasing the value of debt and currency. \n\nHow is it possible you can be so stupid? **No one** believes that. Find me a citation of that.      \n\nInflation and deflation arbitrarily redistributes wealth.        \n\nThe type of financial alchemy scheme you are suggesting does not *produce wealth out of thin air through the magic of central banking monetary policy.* That is the dumbest idea you could post on a libertarian discussion board. You truly do deserve to be fully discredited and humiliated for your bullying, offensive insults to someone on a subject you are so far off on your own with that it doesn't even qualify as wrong anymore. You're not even within the realm of educated economic thought.\n\nedit: I need to stop engaging you. I have you on ignore now. you deserve to be discredited but someone else can do it.
Nothing is made up. Calm down and let's not resort to ad hominens, ok? I just want to understand you correctly. I also am an American, and am a patriot. So we're on the same page that if it was proven that a country intentionally interfered in our elections, there should be sanctions against them. That's what you support, right?

If you read the Mankiw paper, one of the first things you'd notice is this:                 \n\n>Inflation is a tax on holding money balances.                    \n\nJust to be clear your original assertion that I was wrong about US monetary policy devaluing currency from the US public. It also devalues fixed-income instruments.       \n\nSo you were wrong on the inflation and seigniorage issue. Let's be honest, you said you'd stop your internet bullying, but you didn't.             \n\nJust so we're clear, Mankiw never says seigniorage is a rounding error - the whole point of that paper is to find the optimal amount of seigniorage. Remember when you were insulting me for not being able to read?         \n\n15 billion is double the EPA budget, in 2017.      \n\nYou are wrong about all of these things. When it's made so blatantly obvious that you can no longer deny it, you move on to some other topic. I am no longer engaging you any further.             
>inb4 every comment saying gold standard is retarded\n\nThose comments need to stop. The American people have a right to oversee the responsible issuance of their own currency. [It has been done in America in the past and it has been proven that it can work.](http://press.princeton.edu/titles/746.html). Little-mentioned fact by mainstream economics is that even without the possibility of a gold standard, Abraham Lincoln gave the banking empires the finger, and granted this power to credibly print the country's own money, [which won him the Civil War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenback_(1860s_money)).                                                                                      \n\nYou don't *need* a gold standard, but the thing about it is, it's a hell of a lot better than allowing the current monetary policy schemes to continue. *There's a fucking good reason people from Friedman (right, libertarian) to Aaron Swartz (left, socialist-leaning or anarcho-socialist), from Ron Paul (right, libertarian), to Bernie Sanders (left, socialist-leaning) all want to end the Fed*.                   \n\nThe problem is the bankers have enormous vested interest in corrupting politicians and we have always let politics go back to serving them. *They produce almost nothing of real value in the world.* Investment banks, hedge funds -- those should all be run with their investor's *own* money. The Fed acts as their taxpayer-funded guarantee to risky investments.                                                                         \n\n**Current monetary policy is a social engineering scheme which steals wealth from the working class and gives it to the capitalist class.**                            \n\nI went through the effort to thoroughly debunk one of our resident not-actually-libertarian, self-ascribed internet bullies ["you can't read if you think the gold standard is a good idea"](https://www.reddit.com/r/Libertarian/comments/5uyj3n/mythbusters_nogold_didnt_fail_as_money_by_ron/ddymxl4/), who has now begun deleting his posts. Do not listen to these charlatans.                                        \n\nThe thing is, [people like the above who believe in thoroughly-debunked financial alchemy](https://www.reddit.com/r/Libertarian/comments/5uyj3n/mythbusters_nogold_didnt_fail_as_money_by_ron/ddyr99z/?context=3) that no mainstream economist agrees with, are not just non-libertarians, they're not even up-to-date with Republicans or Democrats on the issue. **Nobody agrees with them**. Nobody in mainstream economics, no one in the Austrian. Nobody except for people with no credentials to know what they are talking about.                                                         \n\nLibertarians are smart enough to realize that [Nothing is for free.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r6hgEkdSlJw). You can't create *wealth* out of thin air by playing around with how much money you are printing. Wealth is *real value*. It is *real goods and services* produced by *real people.* It is not created by morally vacant bankers and government technocrats. It is what is produced that is actually useful to people.                        \n\nWe have the right to responsibly control our own money and we need to do it. This is not a left vs right debate. This is an issue of basic liberty of the American people of being deprived of their constitutional rights and of their own wealth. Or, we can keep letting the Fed and the Banking Empires keep [arbitrarily giving our wealth to an over-bloated industry of people who provide almost no value in the world, yet create financial panic](https://www.sanders.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/the-fed-audit). I don't care about gold standard or not, the bigger issue is the current system needs to go and the new system, whether of that modeled after Lincolns just credibly-print-money and empower your nation, or Friedmans K-percent rule, or one based on competing metals such as Ron Pauls, **they all return power to the people and to the strength of our economy, and take it back away from the plutocrats, capitalist class and bankers.** Don't let people convince you to give away your rights. There's an entire academic field in economics which serves to justify the current system of monetary policy. This is not science. This is the best kind of propaganda: academia. Money is not magical and mysterious, but very smart people will try very hard to convince you that it is, and that ordinary people are not smart enough to manage it themselves, that's why you need to listen to them.

You don't have to be sorry, you're actually not in disagreement with me, whether you realize it or not. I actually agree with you that it does matter for your convenience. It still does not matter for logical consistency--that's exactly what a logical fallacy is.
So a country that intervenes in US elections should be subject to sanctions? Am I understanding correctly?
>I just was thinking about what people think the appropriate response should be if it is the case that our government starts putting another country's interests above ours, like sending them money or kickbacks or something like that especially if it was done after it was proved that they interfered in our elections.

You're in safe space here bro.              \n\nI just was thinking about what people think the appropriate response should be *if it is the case that our government starts putting another country's interests above ours, like sending them money or kickbacks or something like that* especially if it was done *after it was proved that they interfered in our elections.* I mean, I guess it's not out of the realm of possibilities that our government could do this, don't you think so? And what should be done if we find out they were? 
You support sanctions against countries that interfere with our elections?

> You only care about human life because it is somehow more valuable than other life\n\nYep. Humans are more valuable than things that aren't. That's why I can kill a cow and it's not morally reprehensible or equal to murder.\n\n> I can't in my right mind let a child come into this world knowing it is unwanted.\n\nWhat is your solution? Kill it?\n\n> 3) Depends on what? You don't want birth control to be freely available?\n\nIt is freely available.\n\n> 4) That's really impractical.\n\n> 5) You did not really answer that question.\n> \n> Please don't again answer that it is her responsibility\n\nI answered it. You just don't like the answer.\n\n>  A 16 year old doesn't know anything. \n\nIs a 16 year old responsible enough to be charged with any other crime and sent to prison? Yes or no please.\n\nThey can't drive? Where do you live?\n\n> What we can do is come to a reasonable solution.\n\nYou don't care what is right or wrong. We can't do it because it's "unrealistic", "impractical". or "not really possible". It's junk. The worst part is that it stems from opinion. We can't outlaw abortion because it is your opinion that sex is a basic human need. It isn't. You don't need sex to survive. Ask the celibate.\n\nYou have formed an opinion that sex is a need, is good for everyone, and should be done responsibly. Then you want sex-ed not to teach the potential consequences but to teach how to have "safe sex". Now that we've done that we have a responsibility to help those who have sex while maybe even using contraception and still get pregnant.\n\nWe can't hold the people having sex responsible for their actions. They are teenagers. Maybe they are young adults who were "being responsible" just like they were supposed to. No one is responsible for getting pregnant in your world.\n\nNow we need to decide how to fix it. Can we really "ruin" that persons life? It's a human being right in front of us. It would be "better" if that person wasn't pregnant. So, let's just agree that a zygote isn't human because we need to give that woman an opportunity to "fix" their mistake.\n\nAs I said when I started, people need to have sex and it's impractical not to have it. We need abortion to make sure that the need of sex is fulfilled. The best way to reduce abortion is to now give out tons of contraception to try and limit the number needed. Look! It works! It's reducing the number of abortions! We now have an inherent need for abortion within our argument, but we can feel good knowing that we are doing everything we can to "limit" those numbers. Look at the studies. They all say the same thing so we are obviously all right. Yay!\n\n> You can't impose your view on each and everyone, especially when there is so much debate about it.\n\nThis isn't a debate. That is your entire argument. Your argument stands on a foundation of sexual freedom and the inherent need to get rid of unwanted children in a sexually free society. There isn't some kind of academic or logical argument that is missing. It is the most straightforward argument you can get. You want everyone to be able to have as much sex as they want because it is "good". They you want to cry for the government to come in and pay for the STD testing, cancer screenings, contraception, and legalize abortion to fix the problem when they inevitably occur.\n\nThe worst part is that you have the audacity that I have to "walk one step" to meet you somewhere. No. The entire argument is wrong from the very start. How about you walk one step towards my side and concede that sex is meant for a loving marriage and contraception should only be used to better plan for the family you want. Take that step into my direction and we can both agree to terms immediately. That's not going to happen though because of "freedom".\n\nYou are free to have sex. I'm not banning it. You are just also free to bear those consequences. Welcome to the real world. Your actions matter and you have to pay for them. It sucks. I know.\n\n
Hey now, relax. You said it twice already, I get it. I actually edited my comment. My bad, I missed that you already clarified it. Not sure how, I thought you hadn't said it, yet. You should read my comment after I edited it:\n\n>Edit: I see now you already said to sanction them. My bad.\n\n>I was thinking about this, since Trump is allegedly putting the interests of another country above ours. What if the situation grew worse and Trump was actually funding that country instead of sanctioning them? What do you think we should do in that case?\n
I think Greenspan is getting old and starting to worry about his conscience and missteps in life, as old people always do.               \n\nFrom the article:                    \n\n>"Deficit spending is simply a scheme for the confiscation of wealth. Gold stands in the way of this insidious process. It stands as a protector of property rights. If one grasps this, one has no difficulty in understanding the statists' antagonism toward the gold standard."                              \n\nHere is another source:        \nhttps://mises.org/blog/alan-greenspan-admits-ron-paul-was-right-about-gold                              \n>"We would never have reached this position of extreme indebtedness were we on the gold standard, because the gold standard is a way of ensuring that fiscal policy never gets out of line.”                    \n\nPretty telling. Libertarians need to stop drinking the cool aid that "mainstream economics tells me we need a big government to manage our currency for us so it must be true." Epaulets != scientific accuracy. Think about who is giving out those epaulets. Macroeconomists are people who self-interested desires like anyone else. They want nothing more than an influential position and high paying, ultra-powerful position in the bloated money and banking economy made possible by our federal reserve.                  \n\nWe don't need a Fed. If we're going to have a Fed, monetary policy should be run by a computer program. Better to not have a Fed. If the gold standard is the best way to do it--it might not be ideal but I'd support it. We don't need fractional reserve banking.     \n\nIt's going to be so hard to do that, though. So many people have powerful careers that would otherwise not exist if it wasn't for that scheme.\n
Unfortunately you're being overwhelmingly difficult and somewhat hostile so I didn't get around to my point. My point is there is already a government that has always proven to, and which sometimes even openly brags about, influencing US elections. We actually openly send this country billions of dollars. Was trying to see if you'd have a double standard and doublethink moment that was dependent on what media and government told you how to think about what your government does with your money.
Yes. If you read my post you would already know that I've commented on the idea that mainstream economics is subject to group think and politics. You'd also know I don't think a gold standard is ideal, but I think it is better than what we have at the moment.              \nEverybody in economics thought monetary policy was a really stupid idea and would deride and disparage anybody who said otherwise, until Keynes came along.

The fact that your only hope is to fall to the level of slinging childish ad hominen attacks is telling. There's not much of substance in your comment yet again, aside from the ad hominens, it again mostly boils down to "you're wrong," or "yes I do" or "you don't."                         \n\n    >deflates wealth from the US public and US bond holders.                                 \n\n>Not actually true.                                                        \n\nOnce you can figure out that seigniorage is, please get back to me with an explanation.

It's wholly ignorant and reveals you have horrendous knowledge of monetary history.                           \n\nIt is possible to come to the conclusion that monetary policy is a good idea, or not a good idea; and in fact, your banally-derived conclusion that it is a good idea is in line with most mainstream macroeconomists. **However, you have no idea how they got there.** You don't understand the vocabulary or the concepts that they used to arrive at these conclusions. You just work in some shit job in finance -- a industry that relies on the corrupt system of monetary policy in the US. There's a fucking reason people from Friedman (right, libertarian) to Aaron Swartz (left, socialist-leaning or anarcho-socialist), from Ron Paul (right, libertarian), to Bernie Sanders (left, socialist-leaning) all want to end the Fed. You're wholly ignorant of how people come to these conclusions, *you just have your conclusion, which has been spoon fed to you, and have no idea how it was derived.* You are some tool, working a desk job in fucking finance, serving a system that provides no value to society and drinking the cool aid of it all, then regurgitating that bullshit onto reddit. Get over yourself and your shitty misinformation.                                                                    \n\nSeriously, tell me what your credentials are.               \n
> then yes you would require much more energy to accelerate the same amount as a car stationary relative to the planet.               \n\nThat conclusion raises a problem. If that is the case, then we need to calculate Tesla A and Tesla B's total velocity when they go from 0-20kmh or 20-40kmh to account for their rotation around the earth, the sun, and the galaxy.

You're right on the button. I do.        \nUnfortunately, one of the lessons of science is that humans learn best when we can test our hypothesis. *No one knows the exact answer, and it would probably be circumstantial, dependent on culture, technology, time in history, etc.*                     \nUS Presidents in the past have printed money with respect to GDP growth in order to prevent the problem when currency being seen as an *investment or commodity* itself. In other words, deflation. It's a problem because eventually holding currency becomes profitable just as holding a commodity or holding an investment does. Look, the thing people understand is that wealth does not come from fairy dust--nothing is free. When you have deflation, hoarding money becomes a way for you to profit from growth in the US economy without actually making any business investments. That's why it's bad.                            \n*The biggest problem, though, is the corruption which exists in central reserve banking.* Get rid of them. K-percent rule--it can even be printed by the US treasury, and abolish the Fed. No more need for open market operations. Just print the money subject to macroeconomic factors.                                                                       \nHowever, all the the libertarians on reddit with no training in economics upvote the other response in this thread, rather than yours which is actually a pointed question of inquiry, not a list of monetary policy prescriptions that "don't make us look bad," which are wholly based on ignorance and in complete ignorance to the work Friedman and others have done already.                 
It's a little bit funny in an ironic way that criticizing grammar/spelling is yet another ad homine**n** attack :)       
No. What I'm saying is self evident already. It is that it is important to have studied a subject if you want have expertise in that subject--and formal education is part of that--but it is also important to have critical thinking skills, and be able to question assumptions, question authority, and question non-scientific conclusions.              \n\nThe same thing can be said about other disciplines, and it [would have prevented national disasters.](http://www.nytimes.com/2003/03/09/weekinreview/the-nation-nasa-s-curse-groupthink-is-30-years-old-and-still-going-strong.html). In aerospace engineering, it's important to have a formal education, but it's also important to question authority and be able to question assumptions, especially non-scientific conclusions.             \n\nI hope that makes more sense.
This is *really* sad. \n\n1.) Your comment boils down to mostly "yes you do," "no you don't" conclusions -- *those are not arguments.* They are opinions.                   \n\n2.) What you have written clearly displays that you have no training in higher education in economics. I don't even know where to begin, some of the stuff you have written is so unfounded that it would be considered *not even wrong.* You don't actually even understand what inflation is or what it does to our currency. You revealed this when you told us that you don't know what seigniorage is while simultaneously declaring it to not actually exist, but if you'd taken even an intro course in economics you'd know that you are wrong about that. You don't know what a technocracy is. There are **mainstream concepts that you would be taught had you any respectable degree in economics.*** You think inflation is due necessarily due to fractional reserve *banking* (the correct term is fractional reserve banking, not lending). You think currency as a commodity has *never* existed. You are wholly ignorant. It's really obnoxious honestly.                         \n\n3.) **You are spreading misinformation and making this sub look bad, and people are buying it.** I have a degree with honors from a top US university. You have no proper education in macro- or financial- economics. Please, stop.              \n\nHoly shit.\n\n

It means you are libertarian.             \n\nLibertarianism is the opposite of authoritarianism. So a libertarian fascist would be an oxymoron.

The negative connotation associated with the word *extreme* in political discourse is very real. It has no place in defining libertarianism.            
Thank you. That is correct.
While this is a positive action and is rightly appreciated, it is primarily just virtue signaling.            
\nAlright, but I still am confused. How much energy does Tesla C require to accelerate 5kmh? is the v^2 term 5^2, or is it a very large number?
Yea basically you got it.              \nAs an analogy: A guy that emotionally abuses his wife can go around gas lighting her and yet still buy her a bouquet of flowers and build her a kitten house. That's what I mean by pointing out the virtue signaling. It's a good act in itself but doesn't have a whole lot to do with the fundamental and overall ethics of the department.               
Edit: I see now you already said to sanction them. My bad.   \n\nI was thinking about this, since Trump is *allegedly* putting the interests of another country above ours.

Ad hominen is in fact a logical fallacy, and I've already explained how it is in the comments here. I'm sure most "9th grade" students can even understand it.

>The larger the electric charge the stronger the electric force on an object due to an electric field. \n\nHmm, so increasing the charge would be increasing coloumbs, or the amount of *-e force*. So increasing charge increases force, yes. But where does voltage come in? To get energy, we'd still have to multiply our charge by voltage to get something like joules.        \n\nSo what you're saying is true that we can increase force by increasing charge, I'm OK with that, but how do we *add electrical potential, aka voltage* to increase our energy output? I know we can put batteries in series, etc., but what are we *really fundamentally* doing with nature when we do that?
That's not actually what I said. I'm sorry you are having such a hard time understanding this.

By providing the government with increased purchasing power at the expense of the public's purchasing power, it imposes what is metaphorically known as an inflation tax on the public.                  \n\nI have lost all faith you can wrap your head around an introductory macro-economics concept that is plainly available for you to read in any mainstream textbook. *There is nothing controversial about me saying monetary policy deflates wealth from the US public and US bond holders. That is a self-evident fact within mainstream economics.** You are the only idiot in the world who claims to be an expert on macro-economics and denies this.

BS w/ honors in Econ from top US university.                  \nEcon should be taught as close-to-the-facts as possible, and with attempt to not focus on any one school of economic thought, while providing overviews of all of them.          \nSome ideas in history that were once absolute crackpot theories within economics are, today, common sense.             \nEconomics can't experiment the way a hard science can so it's very hard to teach it without bias. That in itself should be taught.       \nThat said, there are many ideas which economics tries to establish as close to being scientific theories as possible -- that is, they are well-tested as best that economics can test them. And you shouldn't focus on the prescriptions of the schools of thought, you should teach the foundations, i.e., just one example, teach Ricardian Equivalence, but don't teach "government should decrease spending."                              \n

Libertarianism is a red pill because it makes people start thinking about liberty, which includes their basic constitutional and civil rights. Once they start thinking about that instead of degenerate or racist ideologies, for example, things like "gender binaries," "white guilt," or "white privilege," people look at those ideologies and start to realize that meanwhile they're working their asses off as they struggle to support themselves while government arbitrarily transfers their wealth to others who did nothing to deserve it.\n\nPeople start to realize they're being walked over and their constitutional and civil rights are being taken away. Free speech is being assaulted. Highway robbery is legalized under civil forfeiture laws. Whistleblowers are prosecuted. The mega banks are rich while they destroy the economy. People are so sick of all this injustice.\n\nHowever, the alt right is not the answer. Two wrongs do not make a right. The answer is to uphold liberty, which includes justice for all people. All people have the right to be treated equally by government.\n\nThis country was built on liberty and justice. It was not built on fascism. Nor was it built on slavery like the authoritarian left wants you to believe. Slavery and racism was an injustice that always harmed the country. The authoritarian left wants you to believe in this BS idea that America was built on your original sin of "white guilt" so they can guilt-trip you into accepting a continued movement away from liberty and justice. They don't want you to know how important liberty is to the success of this nation, and that it was what made America great.\n\nPeople realize the bullshit, they get red pilled, but their anger pushes them to the alt-right. That will just create more injustice. We need to go back to liberty. Not fascism.\n

I don't support Spencer nor do I want him at libertarian conferences, but Tucker should have walked out of there after he dropped the best he had to say: "fascists are not welcome at an anti-fasct conferences." Other than that the video was awful, stuff like: "You got punched, OOOOHHHHHH!" and "YOU'RE A LOSER OOOHHHHH!" "YOU'RE A TROLL" "YOU'RE A LIAR" "YOU CAN'T EVEN TAKE A PUNCH HAHAHAHA!" Spencer was not the one yelling, nor throwing childish ad hominen attacks, but I do not support his politics, nor do I want him devaluing the libertarian movement. Everybody lost in this moment.

As it stands he may or may not have been racist, but what he exhibited in the video is called prejudice.                        \n\nThe woman also telling him to go back to Australia is also prejudice, not racist.                  \n\nThe more you know.

Not just Saudi. There's another country we're actually sending boat loads of money to. Obama gave nearly 40 billion to this country. They brag about influencing our elections, but the media stays silent.
Can you just Google it? I don't want to keep mentioning the name because I'm probably already on a list and every time I mention it my political dissident score probably increases. Fuck it, here, I'm probably already screwed for having already mentioned it when not behind TOR: https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/5gxqdz/wake_up_story_criticizing_foreign_aid_to_israel/                              \n\nIt's the only country in the world you can't criticize. And it's the only country in the world which brags about influencing our elections (as well as influencing the EU) for their own direct benefit. It's the only country America sends such ridiculous amounts of money to. Reddit censors any threads that criticize it.                \n\nI just wanted to see if you'd doublethink. Doublethink is when you hold two opinions which logically contradict each other as the result of media/political conditioning. Since you were so upset about the idea that Russia *might* have influenced our elections I wanted to see what you'd think of the fact that another country is actively doing it and we're sending them billions of dollars a year.                        \n\nSo how do you feel about those sanctions. Still support them?                                               
If you trespass on my yard once, it's a mistake and I forgive you. If you trespass on my yard twice, it's bad judgment, but I forgive you. If you trespass on my yard 100 times, you're a fucking trespasser and I probably will hate you. 
You'e right, and I think this is a very good thing. Let them continue to make fascist a meaningless word. If everyone's a fascist, it loses all practical meaning as a slur.
If you want to stop uncritically reading headlines and understand what's going on then read this. No I don't support Trump.               \n\nThe industry that has propped up to either support or profit off of the global warming problem has turned into institutions with the same problems that the War on Poverty had, but the problems are exponentially worse.              \n\nThe problems are this: The movement started out as well-intentioned, and remains to have an apparent underlying well-intentioned goal, but the bureaucracies themselves inevitably evolved to exhibit something called [bureaucratic inertia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bureaucratic_inertia). In other words, the same thing that happened in the War on Poverty is happening: the bureaucracies are putting their own importance and their own survival over actually fixing the problem.                     \n\nGlobal warming is going to be fixed by direct action and market-incentives. Those are the only two ways anything is going to be done. We don't need endless bureaucracies arguing with each other about really how bad global warming is. We need to fix the problem. 
It's at least better than what we have at the moment.      \n\nMoney does not need endless institutions, bureaucracies, global mega banks, technocracies, and monetary policy (financial alchemy)... it's all just institutional, academic corruption that serves a plutocracy class and deflates wealth from the US public and US bond holders. It makes holding currency no longer rational because your plutocracy is literally stealing its value as every day that goes by, so you're forced to invest it. Most people buy into corporate America.        \n\nIt's just theft through social & monetary engineering.                    \n\nMoney can just be printed by an automated factory at a rate equal to that sufficient to keep inflation at 2%. I'd argue for 0% but the massive correction that would force down our throats would cause people to immediately reject it because everyone wants their cake and to eat it, too, all the while expecting not to get fat.
It's really the most feminist way to deal with the situation.

> Ok, so you cite a currency that was issued for less than five years during the civil war economy as proof it doesn't need to be managed?                  \n\nAre you retarded? You claimed the US was managing gold for the entire duration of its history. That was an example of a time when it wasn't, and it fucking worked, *really well.* No monetary policy institutions, no gold standard, just fiat currency based on a credible government. You can't follow a line of thought, can you?                \n\nYou deserve ever ounce of criticism you get. You prop yourself up as an authority, write insults and ad hominens to people that actually know what they're talking about.\n\n
More like an evil genius
Woah there, relax. I was just asking you a question. You said we should sanction Russia, so I just asked a follow up question about it. I don't know why you don't want to answer.
> I agree that inflation lowers the spending power of currency, but is is NOT decreasing wealth from the US public as a whole.\n\nYou are remarkably stupid.
You're correct. Fact is, we are already at war with Russia. The war in Syria is a proxy war with Russia. Facts get down-voted in r/politics. This place is very Orwellian. I will post a source:                       \n\n[The number one foreign policy priority of the CIA over the last four to five years](http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2017-01-13/tucker-carlson-and-glenn-greenwald-discuss-deep-state-war-vs-trump-while-ex-spook-hi)                         \n
It still doesn't make sense to me. I'm not saying you're wrong, I just don't know what the answer is. Can you give me a definitive answer? Say, we need to go to the supermarket tonight in Tesla C, or we're going to starve, and we need to know how much energy we need to do this. Do we need the term v = 5^2 or v = v1 + 5^2? Maybe if you give me example answers to this question it will help. I need to know exactly how much to charge Tesla's C's batteries, so I need an exact answer. You came from Planet Earth, I was here on the imaginary earth the whole time. If you charge the Tesla do you need to put more energy into it, since in your reference frame you are traveling at astronomical speed? Maybe I should charge the batteries, since to me, we're at rest, and we'd need to only charge them a little bit.
Libertarianism needs to continue to draw this hard line to separate itself from the alt-right, but don't give it too much attention because that's exactly how establishment politics wants to discredit libertarians. IE "Everyone who disagrees with you is a racist"... alt-right members *are* racists.                   \n\nLibertarianism is about liberty. That's it.                                          \n\nThe alt-right needs to go away. It's filled with hatred and ideas that are inconsistent with the reality of our world. It will never do anything productive and is only causing harm to the libertarian movement.

"The new ordinance requires that game developers such as Niantic, the San Francisco-based creator of "Pokemon Go," get a permit like any other business or group that wants to host park events. The fees will be on a sliding-scale — anywhere from $100 to $1,000, depending on how much of the park will be used and how many people are expected to be there, Wasserman said. The money will help with the park's upkeep, he said, and the permits will help the county prepare for the volume of people."\n\n\nThis seems absolutely ridiculous to me. If this becomes a thing, games makers are going to have to get permits all over the country. I'm not even sure how you can enforce such things. Just so incredibly stupid.

I hadn't really ever paid attention to Milo, but after all this, I have looked up some of his videos. I disagree with a lot of what he says, but I have to admit, even though I find him boorish at times, he is entertaining, and I don't think he's remotely dangerous. 
I got accused of wanting to kill Muslim children because I said I was thinking about buying a gun for personal protection after San Bernadino. 
Based on my reading of the 9th Cir. opinion, you basically have 4 categories of people with interests in this:\n\n1. Lawful residents who may not be able to leave and re-enter under the EO;\n2. Unlawful residents who may not be able to leave and re-enter under the EO; \n3. Non-residents who have family, employers, etc. in the US who have an interest in the non-resident's ability to enter;\n4. Non-residents who have no ties to the US.\n\nI believe the court said that the people in groups 1-3 have constitutionally protected interests that the EO impacts. These people are owed due process and the EO doesn't provide foe that. Those in group 4 aren't really addressed very directly, but I think even the 9th Cir. would agree that these people don't have valid due process claims. \n\nThere's also the issue of religious preference for refugees. This one was addressed pretty straightforwardly - they punted. \n\nI don't know if this ruling will ultimately hold up, but I think they're pretty spot on in determining which groups have cognizable due process claims. \n\nIt'll be interesting to see where this heads.  
With regard to Flynn, sure, investigate. Release the transcripts. \n\nWhen talking to certain Clinton supporters, when I didn't buy the Russians hijacked the election line without seeing some proof, I was mocked as a Trump lackey.

If colleges functioned (maybe they do, I don't know) the way they should, taping in-class exchanges should be considered contrary to the spirit of open discussion. If people are afraid they're going to be publicly shamed, I don't think you can get the free flow of ideas that a college class should strive for.

Instead of targeting these companies, they should encourage the companies to place these objects in their parks and charge a small entrance fee for users. I don't think anyone would have a hard time with that. \n\nMilwaukee could be the fist Pikachu sanctuary city. 
They're going to jail. Not paying because you're a deadbeat gets you levied. Not paying as a tax protest gets you put in jail. 
It was really more of an "endorsement" than an endorsement though. For me, that's a non-factor. 
Well, you can look at it 3 ways:\n\n#1: I said I was uneasy about it, so it's not really hypocrisy. \n\n#2. You can say hay, I persuaded this guy he is wrong.

Notice her last statement:\n\n"That's an important point that will definitely want to discuss more if you have evidence that this is a concerted effort to draw the President into a conflict with Russia I do want to have you back on Congressman..."\n\nWhen you question the deep state, they demand evidence yet they blather lie after lie after lie from the IC, military, think tanks, etc. without ever demanding to see evidence. 
Holy shit, the writing is terrible. 
I'm down with that
Perhaps ineffective but irrational?
It's not a good thing. But a bad thing can produce good results. I don't think we can ignore valid information because it came from a bad source. Maybe I should have said that the leakers should be punished regardless and so should anyone who otherwise violated the law in the IC. That's a fair point. 
Cruz is so terrible. Terrible Ted. 
He's really the reason I was willing to give it a try. I think the zombie genre is kind of overplayed, but I did like this. The whole cast is really good IMO.
It's not Trump was more libertarian. As between the two top vote getters (Trump and Cruz), I felt Trump was less likely to be an interventionist. So, as between Trump and Cruz, Trump got my vote pretty easily. \n\nAs for Rand, he finished about 180,000 votes behind the second place finisher (Cruz). My vote was not going to make a bit of difference for him.\n\nI just have to plead guilty that voting for Trump instead of Rand because Rand didn't meet my purity test was just plain stupid. (God, I'm such an asshole!). 
Probably could have ended it but for Tom Cotton. 
Well then.
I don't see this as a master plan to keep him from talking. I see it as a bureaucratic snafu, which kind of makes a point about Bernie's politics in a strange, roundabout way. 
I thought they were purposely going for very broad, over the top performances to highlight just how friggin ridiculous the whole thing is. It's just so tongue-in-cheek. 
I think this qualifies as fascism under her definition. 
There are so many rumors about what the transcripts might say that I think they need to be released. 
I'm in a very conflicted position.\n\nOn the one hand, I abhor the surveillance state. The fact that they were able to intercept, record, and release details of an American's calls infuriates the hell out of me.\n\nOn the other hand, I believe leaking information about corrupt actions of politicians is extremely beneficial to the democracy as a whole.\n\nI guess I have come down to think that they should release the transcripts of the calls and if they are a whole bunch go nothing, find the people who leaked it and prosecute them to the fullest. If they support the Trump is a Russian lackey narrative, I think you have to impeach Trump and possibly Pence too. What you do to the leakers in that instance is more difficult to know., 
huh?
Maybe, coulda, mighta caused harm, possibly, perhaps...\n\nseems less of a threat to me than my government flat out running over the constitution and lying to me about it.\n\nHold Snowden to account in the proportion of the harm he has caused to this world compared to those who have sworn to uphold the constitution and protect us. He'd die of natural causes by the time we got to him. 
And when you ask 'em, "How much should we give?" Ooh, they only answer "More! More! More!"

I didn't know much about him, but what I read I liked.
Does everyone on Facebook hate you or think you're weird? If yes, it's not guaranteed,  but there's a good chance you're a libertarian.
If you're using violence to achieve political ends, that's not even close to libertarianism. Stated another way, if you're in favor of using violence to achieve a political goal, you're not a libertarian (at least in my view). 
I voted for him in the primary and I have come to regret it. The reason I voted for him is because I really hate Ted Cruz and Rand wasn't libertarian enough for me (plus he was way down in the poll). Trump was well ahead of Cruz in my state in the polls, but I still felt that I wanted to cast me vote for the least bad Republican and then support Johnson in the general. \n\nTurns out, I just didn't vote in the general. Gary just kind of lost it there at the end. \n\nMy primary vote really means nothing, but I still regret it. 
While I can't justify the words he used (they are funny though), I certainly endorse his point on both what Trump said on civil asset forfeiture. 
The game doesn't damage anything. The person playing the game is the one who "damages" the park. The person playing the game is almost certainly a member of the community and has already paid for the privilege of using the park though taxes and fees. \n\nIt's a money grab pure and simple and nothing more than a penalty for using the park for its designed purpose.

Amash is making a policy argument with which many, many policy experts outside of the Trump admin. agree. Trump supporters are making (hopeful) legal arguments that he has the power to do this. \n\nTwo different arguments. The courts will settle one. History will settle the other. 
Has he hinted that they should be hurt yet?
I hope a Trumpian does try to defend that. That's the kind of thing that's going to get someone hurt. It really needs to stop before something bad happens. 
It's a beautiful wall.

I would just stop talking politics with someone who believed Gary Johnson was a fascist. Just not worth the effort.
I don't like Session and was generally opposed to his confirmation, but he is a qualified candidate, so I'm not sure I'm going to lose much sleep over this one. 
Your argument right now is how much it affects. You are making that argument while conceding (I guess) that it isn't effective in the areas it is covering. That just about sums it up for me. Repeal it or enforce it. But don't do neither.
Meh, let me just get right to the point. There is no reason to bait you as you have implied enough.\n\nI have a BBA/MBA in Finance with a minor in economics and I'm a few classes from a minor in theology and philosophy. I am more educated than you are.\n\nI am also married. I've been married over two years. I run my own business and have been an entrepreneur for most of my life. I have never been an employee and have hired numerous people for numerous jobs.\n\nI've also had very human experiences. I've worked in low-income housing and helped the poorest of the poor. I've been on medical missions, housing missions, and visited three continents. I have friends from all backgrounds, including Korea (which I had beers tonight with).\n\nI find your posts incredibly offensive. Not only are you racist, but you are dismissive. Anyone who doesn't agree with your views is deemed uneducated and inferior to you. You have a superiority complex that is entirely unmerited. You've barely ever worked and are very young by the sound of it. I would guess early twenties and I am almost certain that you are not married because your attitude is toxic to be around long-term.\n\nRegardless, one day you will think back on this conversation and be forced to introspectively look at the hatred and racism within you. You will be forced to look at your life in the mirror and improve. It won't be through books. It will be through very difficult events in your life.\n\nCheers mate.
I live in the USA. 11th generation.\n\n> Of course reduced access to contraception would rise the number of abortions because there is no other alternative!\n\nThis is what really gets me. In the absence of contraception abortion is forced? Why not just be abstinent? Why do you have to have sex? I didn't use contraception and I don't have a kid. Shocking!\n\n> the fact is making something illegal won't make people not do it,\n\nYes?... Murder is still illegal.\n\n> It's better to have a legal abortion at 2 months than murder a child at birth\n\nThis is a great justification. It is easier to justify killing a fetus than a child, so abortion should be legal. At least you can recognize that killing children is wrong and that is what your end goal is.\n\n> Contraception should be the first issue handled... what happens AFTER the unwanted child is born.\n\nThis is a great part of your argument. We need contraception to stop the number of unwanted children. We have unwanted children because we need unrestricted sexual freedom. We then need to focus on subsidizing contraception and abortion because we don't want to have to pay for expensive unwanted children. Your argument has nothing to do with children. You don't care about them. I would wager you don't know anyone closely who has sought adoption or participated in the foster care system.\n\nIf you want to discuss making adoption easier I am right there beside you. It is a cumbersome process and needs to be streamlined. Where I won't be is standing next to you asking to kill more children because "think of the children". It's so evil.
> destroy a grand American institution\n\nWhich grand institution are you talking about? Public school in America? Give me a break. We spend $11k a year per student on education. Can you imagine how much that is? A class of 20 gets $220k a year. Absurd.\n\nYou are whining about destroying the public school system. Great! [Private schools do better on SAT scores and by nearly every metric.](http://www.capenet.org/pdf/Outlook399.pdf) Homeschoolers [beat out public school too](https://www.google.com/search?q=homeschool+SAT+average&oq=homeschool+SAT+average&aqs=chrome..69i57j0l2.3085j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8).\n\nPrivate education entities are crushing the education field. How do you feel about Yale, Harvard, or any other highly ranked college? Surely you don't want more state schools to be the standard, right?\n\nIt's just ridiculous. Trump fired a single attorney general who refused to follow his order. Clinton fired every single person in the office of Attorney General when he was elected in the 90's. Again, where were all these vibrant protesters then? You don't care about justice or truth. You care because "your" presidents and "your" congress kept giving the executive branch more and more authority and now somebody you don't like is in power. Suck it up. You did this. You.\n\nI didn't vote for Trump, but at least I have the balls to not hold an arbitrary double standard. The US department of education was a joke during Obama's administration. You just don't know enough about it and you didn't have a shred of experience with them. Maybe DeVos will be a breath of fresh air in a failing education system that has been on the decline for decades. I look forward to receiving a voucher style education system for my children so that I can choose what school they attend and increase their chances for a good education. God Bless America for freedom and opportunity. That is literally all I ask for from the federal government. What do you even want?
I'm hijackiing this comment because it really pisses me off. Like, really really.\n\n[This is a link the the Clery Act reporting for Campus Security.](https://studentaid.ed.gov/sa/about/data-center/school/clery-act-reports) You may not know this but the US Department of Education is responsible for overseeing campus security. They oversee basic requirements like transparency, reporting, and prevention.\n\nLook at the year 2016. Obama was president with a brand new secretary of education that the Senate approved. Only a single university has been fined. I gave a book worth of evidence to this division against my Alma Mater when I found that rapes were being swept under the rug. It's been 5 years and I check up every year to hear how they are doing their best with limited resources.\n\n50 senators were on the floor today voting over who will lead this. 50 people couldn't give two shits whether actual work gets done. You think Arnie Duncan cared? His staff responded directly to my email after I had waited 2 years for something to happen. They flew people down to visit with me and investigate. That was years ago. Still nothing. It's not like they have nothing to report. The University didn't even file their annual report on time.\n\nInstead of Shitting on DeVos can we just have a come to Jesus moment? Can we recognize that the previous two secretaries of education have done a bogus, bull shit job regarding Title IX and Clery Act enforcement? Can you stop calling out someone before they even started and look in the mirror. Your criticisms are warranted, but where the fuck have you been the last 5 years?
Heh, you should try socialism, anarchism, anarchocapitalism, sandersforpresident, or hillary clinton. Every Subreddit is an echo chamber. Reddit incentivizes it and it's pretty bad for the long term health of the website.
Can you actually link the article you want me to read? That sure would be helpful.
Welcome to adulthood. There are costs to being healthy that you need to take personal responsibility for. You married a person who cheated on you. Sorry.
If you think that Trump will resign because he is hurting the country I think you are in for a big surprise where nobody wins.
Ok. But don't expect to effectively enact change by reinforcing ultimatums and division.
Where were you last year? [Where were you when Obama ordered a drone strike that blew up a wedding party in Yemen.](http://www.newsweek.com/wedding-became-funeral-us-still-silent-one-year-deadly-yemen-drone-strike-291403) That's one of those countries on the list. I don't have to make up a 90,000 people were negatively affected number (which is preposterous. How could so many people be affected in a few days). I can definitively say that 10 innocent people died and 24 were injured in just 1 of hundreds of strikes.\n\nWhere were you when the state department armed Al-Nusra and groups that defected to ISIS?\n\nYou are talking about right-wing extremists as if you have him pegged as a fact. His attorney general defied his executive orders and decided she wasn't going to work for him anymore. That's what happens when you defy your boss. You have to quit or be fired. She forgot to go make such a big stand when we were killing civilians in drone strikes. Where was she then?\n\nI agree that Bannon has no place on the security council. Let's go out and march on the issue. Let's make it clear that he doesn't belong.\n\nYou are again claiming he is fascists. What act of violence has Trump committed? He was one of the only Republicans to suggest pulling out of the Middle East and dampening our foreign policy. I'd peg him as an isolationist, which is far from Fascism. You are using a term that doesn't make any sense. It's a buzz word that you just made up because "Trump is literally Hitler". He isn't. It delegitimizes your cause when you make absurd claims.
Like everyone other liberal, you are probably a scientific utilitarian relativist. Truth is found in scientific analysis. We should form public policy based on the "best" metric. We determine that metric by relative measures.\n\nSo, society is "better" if we allow abortion because it could be worse by another metric that you get to decide. The likely argument is that you are thinking of all the mothers who die in botched abortions or the struggles they have to go through if they are forced into motherhood. You just didn't realize that truth is inherent and unmoving. You forgot about the cost of the dead children in all of this.
Propaganda:\n\n> information, especially of a biased or misleading nature, used to promote or publicize a particular political cause or point of view.\n\nI use the term liberal to define the current US political spectrum of democrats and leftists. There are numerous definitions, but this is by far the most accepted in the US and Europe.\n\nTherefore, Liberal Propaganda would be information that is biased or misleading in nature used to promote a liberal political cause. In this case that cause is abortion. It's fairly straightforward.\n\nThe person I am commenting to is lying through their teeth to paint Planned Parenthood as an organization that it is not.
It didn't seem like the owners were going onto the property from the way OP phrased it. Maybe I didn't read enough comments in from him. It seemed like there were unruly dogs running onto his property while the owners were far away. That's a pretty legitimate thing to forcefully stop in the country.
Every single comment blows over the fact that any other healthcare provider can do what they are doing. All general practice facilities, ER's, urgent care clinics, and public health clinics do pap smears and breast exams. It's like touting that you give mints at the reception office and then saying you feed the hungry.\n\nLet's get real here. Not having premarital sex prevents people from dying of cancer. I don't see you touting that. Instead, we have to provide large scale health clinics that are federally funded to protect the public against something they have brought upon themselves. That's why Republicans (and I) don't want it. At some point you have to take personal responsibility for your actions and bear the costs of your own decisions.\n\nI get it. But what about the public? It doesn't work! Look at these studies. I know. At the end of the day they are short-term studies enacted in a broken world with split political leanings that skew results. You have to be able to have sexual freedom. No government is going to tell you no. And now you need the government to give you free sexual health because you had that freedom and no conservative Christian nut is going to stop you because science and sociology say it's best.\n\nI get it. I really do.
I completely agree. The woman should be able to be alive, have freedom, and pursue happiness. Thankfully she can do so while pregnant without infringing on another's intrinsic rights. I am so glad we can finally all agree!
> “Professionals built the Titanic. Amateurs built the ark,”\n\nYikes. This is going to be a rough trial for them. 
I honestly can't figure out why this guy keeps getting upvoted. So many people are complaining about "alternative facts". These kinds of posts just further an irrational divide in America.
I'm looking for it now and having trouble finding a good one for you, but the gist is fairly straightforward: people are bad at using birth control and it has a fail rate anyways. For example, if you just google it about half teen moms were using birth control when they got pregnant. I may have misquoted it and that is what I am remembering.\n\nSomething to keep in mind is that failure rates are recorded by annual failure. Condoms have a 14% fail rate with common users. That means that annually about 14% of people who regularly use them are going to get pregnant. If 9/10 people are using condoms, then 50% of the people getting pregnant will be using birth control when they do. That seems pretty accurate if you think about it.
Why is the healthcare cheap and affordable? When Medicaid and Medicare are not paying for it they no longer offer cheap healthcare. We, the taxpayers, are the one's ultimately providing it. It's not as if other clinics cannot or do not provide similar care and services. You mention that abortion is only a tiny fraction of what it does, but it makes up a giant percentage of non-government revenue. [It's as high as 86% and as low as 40%](http://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2015/09/29/rep_lummis_to_planned_parenthood_you_say_3_of_procedures_are_abortions_yet_86_of_your_revenue_is_from_abortions.html). We don't know because they refuse to actually give the numbers.\n\nI am in favor of providing improved access to healthcare for the poor. I'm just not in favor of using an entity that is also providing the majority of abortions in the US under the guise of "healthcare".
You called?
Can I ask you a basic question here? The Catholic Church has been skewered for these issues. We all know about them. If you are a Catholic you would know the ample steps taken to try and ensure that this doesn't happen again. Granted, sometimes it isn't far enough and sometimes it fails, but can we agree that these steps have been taken?\n\nJuxtapose that with secular organizations. What has the UK Parliament done? How about Hollywood with child actors/actresses? We can even talk about US politicians.\n\nWhile the Church has had it's problems it has largely improved. Can we say the same about other organizations of power?
I barely even want to get into a discussion with you. You want to take a woman's life because a fetus is a "potential life". How about a 37 week old? I have a friend who is in her 37th week. It's the toughest time in a pregnancy. I'm sure you equally understand the the "potential life" of the child doesn't get precedence over the mother. You are OK with late term abortions?\n\nBut then again, when does life begin. In parts ancient Greece it began when the child was around 7. Their parents could kill them without legal consequences. Those children were "potential adults". Fun argument when we get to classify who is a human person and who isn't.\n\nThen again, you think that because I can't get pregnant that I wouldn't hold these beliefs. Do I need to get my wife on Reddit to let you know that even women believe that killing children is worse than having to carry a child to term?
This is just flat out bad economics.\n\nImagine that a baby boomer built their own house. It takes more than 1 person to build a house, but imagine that the wealth they created paid for that house. This retiree now has a house that they are living in, worth a great deal of money, and it's theirs entirely. They built it themselves.\n\nThey didn't "take" money from millennials to build it. They built it themselves and are reaping the benefits. Many of these real life benefits are slight and help us all. Imagine all the patents they are enjoying that drive costs down for us. We benefit from their productivity.\n\nIt's disingenuous to suggest that baby boomers are profiting off of the backs of the younger generations. This is not necessarily the case.
> take a good long look at how your party's policies are actually affecting abortion rates\n\n"metric"\n\n>  proven\n\n"science"\n\nI just started with this phrase tonight and I think I am going to utilize it every time from now on.\n\nLet's dig right into those sources.\n> countries that ban abortion have higher abortion rates across the board, world wide.\n\n> >  comprehensive global study of abortion has concluded that abortion rates are similar in countries where it is legal and those where it is not\n\nThis is literally the first line. Why lie? You create a problem where your argument on it's face cannot be trusted.\n\nBut, let's get past the lies. Let's look at the depth of your argument. You believe that legislation is the key issue here. While I might agree that legalizing drugs might reduce the use and therefore be good, I doubt that legalizing abortion would have that effect and studies generally agree (even yours at least says its even). Regardless, for egregious crimes you wouldn't hold that same stance. If theft was proven to decrease when legalized would you be in favor of it? Probably not.\n\nYour metric is "how to decrease abortions" and so you use relativism to work to that goal by any means necessary. Should we abort babies with down syndrome? We could clearly decrease the number of disabled in the US. If I sent you an article showing that, would it be good? You tell me.\n\nP.S. You don't know my political affiliation.
Well, your comments might have made sense if you were female. For some bizarre reason you think empathy is the most valuable tool in policy and society. That is a really female outlook on life. But, it's also a very liberal, progressive, and socialist view.\n\nThen I started digging because what you are saying doesn't make any sense at all. You grew up rich and around the poor. You are wealthy through luck and intelligence, but you are giving it all away too. Nearly all of your comments are about how much you hate Trump and I've never met a wealthy person who would write or act like you, and I've met plenty of them. Then I get to this one:\n\n> Lol welcome to my life, I have a double major in History and Asian Studies, I have a successful, happy, and adventurous life, and I have a job I love going to every single day and a happy home! Yet people who got degrees in STEM fields STILL act like I'm some sort of idiot for not doing something that makes me a six figure salary.\n\nWhy not just come right out and say that you are not wealthy, have never run a business or produced something grand for society, have very little experience in management, and are just working a job like every other 9-5 kinda guy? Why lie? Why make up such grand acclaims about how smart and wealthy you are? You claim to be in the top tier tax brackets, but you aren't. That is the basis of much of the progressive platform. You are important. You give so much and work so hard. You are really smart, but society doesn't see it. So, you will assert your dominance through government by showing everyone else how to live.\n\nHow compassionate. How empathetic. How brave. I hope you can see that.\n\n
Like, which ones?
I'm glad we can agree that alternative facts don't count. You forgot to link the study so that we could go over it, but thankfully [one of our Reddit friends linked an article talking about that study in another comment!](http://www.undispatch.com/one-paragraph-describes-harmful-global-gag-rule-fighting-hivaids-preventing-unwanted-pregancies/) \n\nYou said:\n\n> you would see that countries with more regressive/conservative attitudes towards women's health have more abortions.\n\nI'm going to assume that you are talking about contraception access. The problem is that I was talking about abortion. The WHO study showed that the global-gag order, which reduced access to contraception, in turn caused more abortions because pregnancy rates rose.\n\nTherefore, **No. Access to abortion doesn't decrease the number of abortions.** The great irony here? Your comment is largely an "alternative fact".\n\nI think you wrote our difference very pointedly. You want to decrease abortions, but I want to eliminate them. I do not stand by the assumption that they should be rare. I stand stating they should never, under any circumstance occur.\n\nDo you know why I say "like every liberal"? Because quite frankly you reek of liberal ideology. Again, me pointing out that you are hopelessly liberal doesn't inherently make me a conservative. That's a false equivalency buckaroo.
This is just such an absurd sentiment. Don't believe in US military expansionism? Go to Somalia where it'll be a paradise for you. What other thing do we do that you disagree with that Somalia doesn't? How else can I say you are better off there for not supporting every government decision?
> These are the unique precursors to life\n\nLol. You can't even get through the argument without giving it away. A precursor isn't life. Thanks for showing how stupid your sperm is life argument is. Yes, I've studied biology...\n\nYour argument about the car stems entirely from this argument and I wish you could just cut out all of the superfluous stuff and get right to the point. I drive a car knowing full well that I might get into an accident. I legally have to buy insurance because the threat is so real. If you cannot afford an accident you cannot afford to drive. You are making false equivalencies when it's actually an argument directly in favor of what I am suggesting. You have to accept and bear the consequences of sex the same way that you do when you get behind the wheel.\n\n> except the solution that he should never drive.\n\nDude, yes. Why is it so absurd to suggest that people should not have premarital sex? Why is it so absurd to assume that there is a "risk of crashing" with sex and that you either have to be ready for the consequences or not do the action.\n\n> you fail to understand that the world isn't a rosy place\n\nYou keep saying that. I work with low-income people every day. I understand the rosiness of the world far better than you do. The difference is that I am not scared of how bad it can be. I cherish the life and I know that the world is going to get better. You just want to kill those who aren't. It shouldn't work that way. Defining the value of a human life always ends badly.
Ahhh, I see. When abortion providers are defunded there is less access to contraception and therefore the abortion rate increases. You are right. Short-term this may happen. What the article also suggests is that government agencies did not make up the difference in time. If we just allow the government and non-abortion agencies to provide access to contraception then this would be revoked.\n\nWe can't do that though. I can just ask you. Would you be OK with defunding Planned Parenthood as long as we fund a different organization doing the sames tasks except for abortion? Now abortion rates won't rise. Win-win.
> Thus, they are the 'seeds'.\n\nWhen seeds sprout are they still seeds? It is my understanding that they change into trees/plants at that time. A sperm and egg do not have unique and separate DNA. You are trying to suggest that defining the start of life is difficult. It isn't. When a sperm and an egg combine a new life has been created. It is for this reason that I am against the destruction of embryos as well.\n\nAnd to think, you thought defining life as unique human DNA was arbitrary. You want to define it with literally a random metric such a contentiousness. Is a person in a coma still a human person? What makes them so? What if their brain never wakes up? Still human?\n\n> My case here is that make abortion easily available in the first trimester. Mistakes happen. To err is human\n\nAnd here is the actual argument that we are going to discuss. You need an embryo/fetus to not be a human person because "mistakes happen". I've never had sex by mistake, but maybe I am just gifted. It seems so hard to accidentally put a penis in a vagina and then have the man ejaculate by accident. The real issue is that we need abortion to secure sexual freedom, which you continue to argue below. Sex is good. Everyone should be able to do so consequence free and we need abortion to make sure those consequences don't exist. \n\n> make abortion only available when a mother or child is at risk\n\nYou want to make killing a child available when the child is at risk? How compassionate... How do you feel about the disabled? Should they be killed? In Iceland there has not been a baby born with down syndrome in 5 years. They are 100% aborted. In the UK, a prominent abortion case occurred when a baby was legally aborted for having a cleft palate. Defining "at risk" and "disabled" is a very genuine concern. As is defining mother's health risks. In the US, it is estimated that there would be under 100 cases of abortion per year if we went by actual life endangerment of the mother. A vast majority of ailments are treatable with modern medicine and after 24 weeks it becomes medically necessary to induce labor instead of aborting, this giving the child a chance for survival. You want these exemptions (as do I), but I doubt you'd be willing to uphold the standards.\n\n> If you believe it is wrong to have an abortion, you shouldn't have sex if you don't want a baby.\n\nI could not agree with this statement any more fully. Well summarized.\n\nI do laugh at your argument. Everyone has a right to define when life begins? I say life begins at 7. If I decide not to have the kid they are still not developed into a fully human person and I should be able to kill them. You respect that, right? Or is there very real metrics to defining human person hood and "forcing our opinions" is very justified in the matter of deciding if another should be legally killed?
Mate, I don't think you understand the US history of unions and federal government involvement. They are fairly highly regulated even today and it's pretty bogus. If you just allow workers to talk to each other and work things out they will decide things for their own. This is how mining towns and large factory workers gained such high pay and workers rights. It wasn't the government. The entire town got together and said they wouldn't work unless they got paid more and the boss man had to cave.\n\nThis goes the other way too. Sometimes workers are idiots who want more than they deserve. Hostess got into bad union troubles with crazy contracts. The workers wouldn't budge and everybody got fired. Hostess got sold off and now Twinikies are being made at a cost that is reasonable by workers who aren't holding the company hostage.
People shouldn't be complaining because they are not legitimate complaints. The exact things they are complaining about have been ongoing for the entire previous administration. I have not seen a single concern for Title IX or Clery Act enforcement on Reddit until DeVos was up for nomination. It's garbage. It's partisan garbage and the people complaining have no concern for justice or truth.
> Abstinence is not going to be implemented by everyone it's moronic to think that.\n\nThis is the difference between you and I. You fight for the current broken world and I fight for a better world. I don't have kids, but I will soon. I am also open to adoption. You keep trying to peg me as someone that I am not. It is as if being a moral and ethical person and fighting for ideals is now offensive to you. It's hard for you to rectify that there are people out there who are actually really good and moral people. We exist. I'm sorry if that scares you.\n\nWhat does it matter that I am a white male? Are you racist? Sexist? Yikes.\n\nEither way, oh well. Keep fighting for abortion and contraceptives. I'm sure you will go far in life. Cheers.
>  but they dramatically lower the rate of abortion\n\nHonestly, I don't have to even look for sources anymore. People just give them to me. [This article says that abortions rates are similar regardless of the legality of abortions.](http://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/12/world/12abortion.html) I guess the argument is that more access to contraception reduces pregnancy and therefore reduces abortions.\n\n> as well as making *wanted* pregnancy significantly safer for mothers and babies.\n\nWe just established that they rarely provide prenatal care. How are they making pregnancies safer for babies? I'm glad you used the qualifier "wanted", because pregnancy is clearly not safer for the 330,000 abortions they provide every year.
One thing that is often forgotten is that mobile homes are not charged property taxes. Because they are not fixed to a foundation they are considered an asset or personal property and are taxed on a depreciating scale. The land they sit on is obviously taxed, but not very much. Thus, illegal immigrants that live in mobile homes are not paying substantial public school taxes.
I mean, 200 yards in is a very long way. This guy lives in the middle of the country. He has warned the owners. He has called the cops. The cops recommended he just shoot the dogs. I know that most people on Reddit are not familiar with country living, but that is a pretty reasonable way to handle it. I've seen the outcome of a dog getting into a chicken enclosure and killing a bunch of them. It's a real mess.
No, miscarriages are fundamentally not abortions and are not included in statistics. Believing so is naive at best.\n\nPlanned Parenthood does not provide mammograms, which are probably the most common cancer screenings for women in the US. They do provide papsmears to search for polyps, scarring, and other irregularities that can indicate that a woman has HPV. HPV can cause infertility, but it is fairly rare and generally is just an indicator for increased risks of cancer and should be watched closely through a woman's life.\n\nThat being said, you are backtracking on your claims that they provide prenatal care to now suggesting that their STD testing is providing people a chance at future healthy children. While I don't necessarily disagree, **your original statements are misleading and false.** I just want you to recognize and admit that.
What is the answer that you know? I am very curious.
> She was wanted\n\nMy cousins are housing two kids in foster care. They are twins. Their parents were clearly a drug addict. I don't need to ask. My other cousins wife died in child birth. It was a horrific birth and his daughter was thought to be developmentally disabled. She is doing great now, but the last time I visited it was clear that the twins were... behind. I can assure you that plenty of women have unwanted children.\n\n> What makes his life less equal to be not saved?\n\nInteresting moral argument. The difference is that in this argument you are having to choose to save one whereas abortion is a willful act to kill. There is nothing morally wrong with choosing to save a 75 year old over a child. Personally, I would save the child as I'm sure any reasonable 75 year old would prefer. I haven't killed a person to make that choice. It's an entirely different argument.\n\nYou mention that I strawmanned you. You know what really grinds my gears? Really pisses me off? It seems as though every time I decide to start commenting on Reddit people mention somewhere that I have "strawmanned" them. Every. Single. Time. The worst part is that they always are strawmanning me and can't see it. You think that choosing who to save is the same as choosing an abortion? It's preposterous. It's not even close to what I commented. Stop saying people are using logical fallacies if you are using them yourself and don't even know what they are. It makes you look like an idiot.
It's like people think that I agree with Trump because I am tired of seeing political shit all day. It's so ignorant. At least argue about something he is wrong about anyways.
>  if a woman has a spontaneous abortion (miscarriage, remember)\n\nYou did misspeak. These are two different terms. It's as if saying my father died and my father was murdered are the same. An abortion is not a miscarriage. I'd be glad to educate you on the medical differences if you are interested, but you can easily google them if you want to know more.\n\n> Aww, how cute, you're attempting to dehumanize me, insult me, infantilize me\n\n> > This is where reading comprehension is important.\n> > \n> > So, I know your reading comprehension isn't exactly strong,\n\nYou have insulted me multiple times. I use a meme and suddenly you are offended. How cute. My favorite part is that you are insulting my reading comprehension. Did you read the entire thing or did you just intentionally try to cherrypick to fit your cause?\n\n> Occasionally a woman presents at this stage for pregnancy termination because of her own severe medical illness or **a psychiatric indication**. \n\nLet me get rid of the superfolous information for you. "A woman presents... a psychiatric indication" and therefore is allowed to kill her child in the third trimester. **Are you in favor of late-term abortions for the mentally ill?** **Yes or no please.**\n\n> This includes things like Trisomy 21 (Down Syndrome)\n\nHe does late term abortions to abort down syndrome babies. I want to see you directly write that you are OK with killing down syndrome babies at 37 weeks. He will do the procedure for you. This isn't some fairy tale that you can rewrite to fit your story line. He does them. It's on his website. What more do you want? **Do you agree with current late-term abortion laws and exceptions? Yes or no please.**\n\nI must say: Wow. Where did you go for all of that information? It is impressively dense, yet entirely misses the point. Is there a website you are digging this up from? Let's just jump right in and not waste more time here.\n\nThe "spirit" you are indicating is a symbol of the holy spirit. God breathed the holy spirit into man and therefore gave him life. We can actually come full circle and you see the same word used in Acts when the disciples first receive the holy spirit. Were they alive then? Genesis is generally not a literal book in the bible. It is a creation story to show how man and women are made together and in the image and likeness of God. This word is used so often throughout the bible because it is used nearly interchangeably with the holy spirit. Thus, it is the holy spirit that gives man life.\n\nYou then suggest that a verse stating "because he did not kill me in the womb" is pro-abortion? It is explicitly stating that abortion is killing someone. Intentional killing is the literal definition of murder. **This verse is explicitly saying abortion is murder**...\n\nThe Exodus verse was yet another misquoted verse. I would encourage you to look at multiple translations to dissect the verses. The translation here is difficult for English.\n\nNew Century Version:\n\n> 22 “Suppose two men are fighting and hit a pregnant woman, causing the baby to come out. If there is no further injury, the man who caused the accident must pay money—whatever amount the woman’s husband says and the court allows. 23 But if there is further injury, then the punishment that must be paid is life for life, 24 eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot, 25 burn for burn, wound for wound, and bruise for bruise.\n\nIt calls for the death penalty for abortion.\n\n> Virtually all Biblical scholars agree\n\nThat's where you are wrong, kiddo. Numbers is not about an abortion. If you read a good translation of Numbers, say from a [Catholic Bible](http://www.catholic.org/bible/book.php?id=4&bible_chapter=5), you will notice that the woman is not pregnant. The passage is about the shriveling of her reproductive organs as a punishment for sexual sin. Nowhere does it suggest that an abortion is taking place. I'm not sure who these scholars are, but they surely do not understand Latin.\n\nI have absolutely no idea why a specific verse where God asks to count month old first born sons and up is grounds for abortion. Can we kill women because they aren't listed in that verse? God left out women there, so are women of no value?\n\nIt gets even worse in the next verse you bring up. This is a verse regarding offerings for the community. Each person has a different requirement for offering based on their means. It even continues to say that if one cannot afford it he should go before a priest to ask for a lesser charge. This is a means based offering with general guidelines. How in the world do you find that God values a human less based on an offering requirement?\n\nEvery single one of these bible verses is misrepresented or misunderstood. You end by suggesting I am making a false equivalency. This is an interesting argument after such a long biblical discourse. You are suggesting that a woman has an ultimate right to her womb and can abort any child that she wants. I suggest that a man might have an ultimate right to his wife and you claim it to be a false equivalent. Not quite so. It was often argued, even in the US Supreme Court, that a man had his wife as property and was able to do to her as he pleased. You are legitimately arguing that a fetus is not human and therefore the property of the woman. That's a fairly equivalent argument. Can a person be classified as property and then treated as the owner pleases? You tell me.\n\nEven worse, the irony here is the vast number of biblical false equivalencies that you made. A verse regarding the price of offerings is equivalent to the value of a human life? A headcount of males in tribes is now equivalent to when a human is alive? These are some of the worst biblical arguments I have ever seen and I've seen quite a few. They are completely unorthodox and I doubt you could find a single priest to agree with any of the interpretations of any of the verses you brought forward.\n\nLife begins at conception. [Catholics have verifiably believed this since the first century and still do today.](http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/_P7Z.HTM) It has never been orthodox to allow abortions within the Christian faith.\n\nI'm sorry. You are arguing with someone very knowledgeable in the Catholic religion. You can't spew junk and expect to be considered right.
It's such an interesting argument to me. You look at a hypothetical persons life and say "that's shit". So, you kill them? Would you make that claim to someone who grew up with a mom on crack? Sorry buddy, your life sucks and you should have been aborted. I really doubt it.\n\nIf you want to be a compassionate society, then pass compassionate laws to children who are less fortunate. Find bipartisan ways to do so. What you shouldn't do is think about how great life would be with them dead.
>  A comprehensive global study of abortion has concluded that abortion rates are similar in countries where it is legal and those where it is not, suggesting that outlawing the procedure does little to deter women seeking it.\n\nEven the sentences that you quote in your comments do not justify your statements.\n\n> It talks about how the legality of abortion affects the prevalence of it\n\nIt is explicitly saying the exact opposite. Explicitly. I don't know how I can make this any more clear to you:\n\n **Access to abortion doesn't decrease the number of abortions.**
Mate, I'm not trying to be cheeky. I asked the original question because I am genuinely trying to figure out what people are protesting about to join in or walk away.\n\nWhat you are writing is lunacy. Trump isn't a terrorist. Where were you the last 20 years of politics? Bush invades Iraq and destabilizes the middle east. Obama promises to pull out and rectify, so he does so by what Tulsi Gabbard proclaims as "arming terrorists".\n\nYou can disagree with his policies. I know that I do. Calling him a terrorist is just so bizarre. Imagine it from his perspective. He gets through a hard fought election, there are immediate mass protests before he has even done anything, and then he is faced with continued violence and property damage coming from protesters. Everything he does is blown out of proportion by the media and now you are calling for his and 15 other peoples immediate resignation and there hasn't been a single bill signed or passed.\n\nAt least find a specific issue to protest against and show him what people want. It's such a toxic approach.

> It is just as random as considering sperm as life \n\nDo sperm have unique human DNA? Yes or no please. This is such a tired argument.\n\n> you have put up a arbitrary point\n\nMy argument is that unique human DNA constitutes a human life. What non-arbitrary point would you like to use?\n\n> Yes, I do.\n\nLet's try to take this rationally. Everyone has a right to have sex with whomever they please. Excluding rape, no one is a victim of pregnancy. It is a conscious choice to take a chance and have sex knowing that pregnancy could potentially occur. This is your root issue. You don't like that. You think that shouldn't be the reality.\n\nA 16 year old get's pregnant? It's societies fault.\n\nContraception fails? A woman shouldn't be burdened with a child.\n\nYou then form a misplaced compassion for all of those children. Think of what it would be like growing up in foster care or with a mother who didn't intend to have you. This shouldn't be real life. It would be better if the child were never born. What a sick thing to think for another person. Instead of compassionately trying to assist them, maybe by fixing foster care or participating in it, you simply want them gone.\n\nYou think that I am living in a fantasy world, but I'm sorry to tell you that it is you who live in a fantasy. It is a fantasy where killing is more compassionate than helping others. In Iceland 100% of down syndrome babies are aborted. We, like most of the developed world, are not too far behind. We "compassionately" are killing the disabled before they are born for convenience's sake. The greater the burden the more abortions there are.\n\nCan't we just agree that you want to arbitrarily define life not because it is formed at that point, but because you need life to be defined later in a pregnancy to give you an opportunity to kill it if it's a burden. How brave. How courageous. How wow.
Ahh, no problema senor. I don't know the word in Spanish either. Lol. I actually thought about writing it out in Spanish but didn't know the word.
You would need an overhaul of the tax code which is probably not happening any time soon. I don't believe in the property tax system in general.
Let's assume that nobody is actually paying for it. Is it so hard to believe that half of America, which are protesting right now, have not created fake social media accounts to spread their message in a disingenuous way? Hell, people spread lies on Reddit just for Karma. Imagine what would happen if it spreads your political message AND you get Karma. The sky's the limit.
In theory, yes. In practice, no not really.
>  I have quite a hefty sum of wealth myself that I have saved up and invested wisely over my lifetime\n\n> now I'm 22 (14 days ago)\n\n> I'm 29. (17 days ago)\n\n> I study and write about history for a living\n\n> I've actually traveled and experienced new things\n\n> I drive those exact buses\n\nI'm an asshole, eh? At least I'm not lying to your face. You are both 29 and 22 at the same time. You have worked at IKEA and driven a public bus. You travel frequently, just finished travelling alot, and are probably just out of college with your double major. Who knows? You have claimed to be multiple things. You aren't wealthy. Can't we just admit that together? Why do you have to lie about yourself and circumstance to prove your own meaningless arguments over the internet?\n\nThe core of your argument right now is empathy. I suggested that it isn't very empathetic to take from the rich to give to the poor. So, you countered by claiming you are rich and give to the poor yourself. Without lying, how much money and time have you donated just this year (the last 40 days)? You don't need to answer on Reddit. You need to answer to yourself.\n\n> I hope one day you have a change of heart and actually give your meaningless life value in some small way\n\nI build low-income housing for the most vulnerable in society. I will shift to provide housing directly to the homeless in a few years. I currently donate time and money to multiple charitable organizations. I am a devout Catholic. I just got finished debating someone else about how economic utilitarianism shouldn't be the foundation for laws in society, specifically in regards to abortion.\n\nYou can peg me however you want, but that doesn't make you right. I'm a good guy. I care about other people quite a bit. I want what is best for society. What's best isn't what you are calling for and it sure as shit isn't socialism. But you've never actually lived in socialism and you don't know anyone who has personally experienced it. Socialism is a wonderful fairy tale where everyone is equal and gives to each other. We all work together. It's so wonderful that I would put $20 down right now that you haven't volunteered for a charity yet this year. I'd put another $100 that you haven't given a single dollar to help those in need.\n\nYou're an asshole, dude.
I say this respectfully as a bit of advice because I am sure you are going to face it if your lot in life is true. You are going to have to manage people one day. Being at an executive level it won't be as obvious, but you will very quickly begin to realize that most people are not self-motivated and just don't care. They will steal with every chance they get.\n\nYour empathy for those "without a safety net" is very misguided. I have never met someone without help that didn't have numerous reasons. I work in construction. These guys could make $60k a year, save $20k per year in their early life, and then have a sweet life by their 30's. My current painter just built himself a house valued around $400k and he did it for $220k because he did much of the work himself.\n\nBut... most don't. I have a framer with 5 kids. I had a better one, but he was deported because of his 3rd or 4th DUI. I have workers asking me for money on Friday and if I don't pay they are late on their bills. If I give them the money they have already run out by Monday. Especially the younger guys too. They buy stuff. Just... stuff.\n\nOne day you are going to have to recognize that not everybody cares. More people are on welfare because opportunity costs are going up and immigration has flooded the unskilled labor market. That doesn't mean that opportunities don't exist. It's quite the opposite. I would argue that there is so much opportunity right now that nothing is being properly filled. It's just people can't save enough capital or time to do anything about it.\n\nUse those advantages to do something great. Me, I have figured out a way to provide low-income housing that is relatively high quality for about 20% less than anyone else by utilizing shipping containers in the design. I'm growing and fifteen years from now my product will be a big deal around the coasts as I expand. I won't bring down the cost of housing, but I will slow the rise substantially in my market at least. I encourage you to find a way to do the same, make tons of money doing it, and better society.\n\nYou won't better it by providing contraception. They might have fewer kids, but it's the same person underneath. It's a big change that the individual and family have to make themselves and it will only be made through personal choice.\n\nCheers.
I have anecdotal evidence that says otherwise.
Ha. I am a stereotype. You mean like Mexican's are rapists? That's what racism is. You are a racist, pro-abortionist, feminist who thinks that personal responsibility is wrong.\n\nAre you even out of college yet? Do you have a good job? I would wager that you are frustrated with your life, specifically your income.
This is a pretty unfair post. The article states he is a leader of the group known as Portland's Resistance. I'm sure they are a tiny political anarchist style group. That is by no means a leader of the majority of anti-trump protests in Portland. He is basically a self-proclaimed leader.
> [Sally Quillian Yates \\(born August 20, 1960\\) is an American lawyer. She served as a United States Attorney and later United States Deputy Attorney General, **having been appointed to both positions by President Barack Obama.**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sally_Yates)\n\nI want to make sure that your stance is that under current US law there is nothing that keeps the [government from assassinating US citizens abroad.](https://www.aclu.org/video/aclu-ccr-lawsuit-american-boy-killed-us-drone-strike) Where was her cries when Snowden was not granted whistleblower status?

I'm not. I'm suggesting that a person Obama appointed continually went against her duties to defend the constitution of the United states and took a stance against the new president not for protecting the lives of innocent civilian US citizens, but to make sure that people from Yemen could visit the US.\n\nDo you see how that deligitimizes the stance?\n\nThen again, criticizing both sides is just unheard of. How can someone be against Clinton, Obama, Trump, and Bush! It's almost like they are against mainstream politics...\n\n> Authoritarian: favoring or enforcing strict obedience to authority, especially that of the government, at the expense of personal freedom.\n\nWhich personal freedom has Trump taken away? He banned people from 7 nations from visiting the US. In no way does it affect US citizens or visa holders. We have banned North Koreans in the same way. Are you in an uproar? Obama banned most of these countries for longer time frames as well. Is Obama an authoritarian?\n\n> [Amid confusion, the Trump Administration clarified Sunday the executive order does not bar legal permanent residents — or green card holders – from entering the US.](http://nypost.com/2017/01/30/trump-admin-travel-ban-wont-trap-people-in-airports-anymore/)\n\nYou can't hold random double standards and then claim that the world is coming to an end. There are things to protest against that I have agreed with which you mentioned. Bannon has no place on the security council. That doesn't mean you can label Trump a fascist and terrorist.
>  wealth needs to be redistributed from the rich to the poor,\n\n> and if the wealthy have to pay more to support that system so be it\n\n> but they certainly should pay their fair share\n\nLet's take a quick look at your argument. First, it's that the wealthy need to pay a "fair share". 45% of US citizens do not pay income tax. Of all income and capital gains taxes brought in, 37.8% (2013) is paid by the top 1%.\n\nI am all for flat taxes that are based on equal percentages, but that is far from where we are. Instead, the rich are bearing the vast burdens of society.\n\n> You don't get to be rich for free.\n\nThis is the only point out of your entire rambling that I agree with. Being rich in America is largely earned.[ Roughly 80% of millionaires in America are first generation. Even more, family wealth is generally lost by the third generation.](https://www.cato.org/publications/commentary/real-1-percent)\n I can personally attest to both. My great grandfather was relatively wealthy for his time and my family has squandered their inheritance across the board. My wife and I are on our way to becoming millionaires and will be first generation for both of us.\n\nWhen you want to tax the rich it isn't some evil businessman who isn't paying their fair share. It is a person, like myself, who is paying a majority of the share. I am earning my wealth. I work hard every day. What do I get for that? Discredited and told I don't deserve it. Even worse, I get to hear how someone like yourself wants to take it from me for "the good of society".\n\nHow much do I need to pay you for you to not be poor anymore? Maybe I am just better than a minimum wage worker. Maybe I am self-managing. Maybe I educate myself. Maybe I direct my career. Maybe I save money like a madman to have what I need for my projects. Or, maybe I am just entitled.\n\nYour arguments are bad. Really bad. Then again, if you want to be in a society where everyone is equal and believes just like you, you're more than welcome to go live in a third world country like Cuba where there are insufferable regulations and your type of economy is acceptable.\n\nCheers, mate.
Atheism? Really? Neutralpolitics is probably the best, but they still struggle. It's an echo chamber of American style politics.
> Because then you would know that racism against whites doesn't exist. \n\nI don't think there is anything more racist than saying you can't be racist against someone. Let me rephrase what you just said against a different race: you can't be racist against blacks. They aren't people.\n\nHow bold. How brave. You are so courageous.\n\nYou haven't finished school yet and are a translator. You are in your first job. Let me put it to you in a way that you can understand. You have very few life experiences. You don't know or understand anyone from my perspective and you uniquely hate me with a racist passion because I am not you. That makes me a snowflake and evil because of it, to you.\n\nIn a few years you will be frustrated with your job and career. No one with racist attitudes makes it very far. Think back about this comment when you get there and introspectively improve yourself. Cheers chief.\n
Oh shit. I didn't notice. Why doesn't reddit make posts about this stuff in literally every subreddit?
Climbing over? None. Being built in the US, placed in a park managed by a larger company, and then rented to illegals? Oh man oh man there are so many. I worked for a company that owns 10,000 in Texas. Probably 98% Hispanic by ethnicity. The go-to tenant is a laborer with a family. They generally pay on time. But, when school lets out there are hundreds of kids. One bus actually only stopped at mobile home parks on the same street. It was 100% full.
Ha. It's hard not to laugh at you.\n\n* I link an article to the global gag and you deny that this is what you want to discuss. Then you link an article that discusses just that.\n* You adamantly proclaim that abortion increases when it is illegal, but now it is at least even and doesn't.\n* Now we get to talk about how planned parenthood is really what you want to talk about\n* We can't defund planned parenthood because they do abortions because they do other things that are really what drives down abortion rates too\n\nYour argument isn't even about abortion at this point. It's an argument about contraceptives and specifically using an abortion provider to administer those contraceptives. This is the crux of the debate. Liberals and progressives (democrats) demand that an abortion provider be the one to give out free contraception. Why can't national and local health clinics do that? Why can't we fund those? Why does every liberal have a hard-on for planned parenthood? It's such a deceptive and shitty organization.
> It mostly happens when the woman knows she won't be able to give the life the baby will deserve. To save an apparent life, you end up spoiling two lives when you thrust an unwanted child on someone.\n\nI really encourage you to drive to the nearest ghetto and talk to the children. Tell them how bad their lives are and that their mother should have aborted them. Then tell their mothers how better off they would be if they had just gotten rid of their children. I really encourage you to do that. Why make that argument at 8-weeks pregnant but not when the kid is 8 years old?
You are right about the gag order's origins. I was referring to the fact that research you are citing was created because of the Bush gag order, like the articles we have both cited.\n\n> Didn't know that STD's caused breast cancer.\n\nPlanned Parenthood does not provide mammograms. Thus, they do not effectively screen for breast cancer. Again, the PR machine is great. They provide pap smears which are now recommended for any woman over 18 because HPV causes lesions that may turn into cancer. This is one of the only reasons it is recommended for women so young. You keep suggesting that they are not deceptive, but you keep parroting PR memos to me as if they are true when they are clearly fiction.\n\nRegardless, why does the abortion debate always go to Planned Parenthood? Why is it, to you, that Planned Parenthood has to be the provider of these services? General practice doctors can provide all of these things and, if subsidized, would do it for the same costs that Planned Parenthood provides. Why does it have to be them? Why can't we just concede that we should defund Planned Parenthood and shift the funds to public health clinics instead? Could we agree to do that?
> Planned Parenthood saves more babies than are aborted\n\nLet me just stop you right there with this liberal propoganda. Another commenter did all the work for me this time. I don't even have to use my own sources.\n\n> According to organization’s annual report for 2014-2015, they only provided 17,419 instances of prenatal care services (compared to 3,533,522 STD tests and 323,999 abortions.\n\nYou are 18 times more likely to receive an abortion that prenatal care. Furthermore, that excludes the fact that prenatal care is required multiple times during a pregnancy. If women visit just 3 times for prenatal care, that number jumps to just over 55 times more likely to receive an abortion that prenatal care.
Only if they are affixed to a permanent foundation. If you put them on blocks you will not be charged property taxes.
Can I ask something that I'm sure will be out of nowhere? Are you male or female?
> Won't you be glad that there's help?\n\nI don't understand this mentality. Of course I will be glad when there is help. It will come first from my immediate family (my wife), then from my extended family (my parents, brothers and sisters), then from my local community (churches and organizations I am involved with), and finally from a government safety net. This is how the world should be. We don't need to look to government for everything.\n\n> So we should defund foodbanks\n\n[I know that you think government is the answer, but they really aren't.](http://www.houstonfoodbank.org/aboutus/financials/)\n\n>  I used to be very very conservative (I was in Young Republicans in High School\n\nI don't mean to be cheeky, but you are a young person in college or just out, right? You probably don't manage anyone else. You don't have some kind of high paying job. You probably don't pay too much in taxes.\n\nIn college you are more likely to be taught sociology by a Marxist than a conservative. It's 44:1 liberals to conservatives. It's no coincidence that you were taught by a bunch of people who provide no tangible value how society should be run.\n\n> providing free birthcontrol is a net-positive financially for the US government\n\nAnd for the last time. I get it. There are studies that show net-positives for society and we gotta do it. Think of the world and the children and how great it is. What's the 40 year outlook like? Where is society heading? Why is it heading in that direction? Why are those on welfare growing instead of shrinking in the midst of massive growth?\n\nMeh. Who cares. We need to subsidize birth control so that people can have sexual freedom because the best way to meet the needs of the public is to drop standards to the bottom and let it fester until we can't support it anymore. It works for such a glorious century.
I really appreciate this article. I've had probably a dozen atheists on Reddit claim to me that Hitler was Christian and it was the Catholics who caused German opinion to be so heavily against the Jews. I'd been looking for a source that outright refutes such a ridiculous claim and this is clearly it. Very early on the prominent Catholics were both being persecuted and directly were opposed to Nazi Germany.\n\nThank you so much for this.
Just because some people twist the meaning of religion doesn't mean there isn't a god.
We've had this same statement every day for a week and it has come down to genetics every day.   \n \n!DisagreeWithOP 
The gag order started with Bush. This is what prompted the research... I don't think you even know what it is.\n\nYes, it speaks for itself. Planned Parenthood is such a shitty and deceptive organization that if they can't provide abortions they won't provide aid. It really is that simple. Their entire business model is centered around "free contraceptives" while profiting from abortions.\n\nThen again, they are champions of women's health while providing nothing but sexual freedom based cared. Contraception, STD checks, cancer screenings (which only are needed because of sexually transmitted diseases), and very little more. The rest is to merely create a facade of care that doesn't functionally exist.\n\nI get it. They have great PR. They got you. Jokes on you chief.\n\n\n\n
Let's talk about Clery Act. Who could be against transparency? This act, among other things, mandates an annual security report, filing, distribution, the creation of sexual assault prevention acts, emergency preparedness, and so much more. [Let's look at 2016.](https://studentaid.ed.gov/sa/about/data-center/school/clery-act-reports) Scroll to the bottom. How many schools violated the Act? 1.\n\nNo way. Thousands of US schools receive federal dollars but only 1 fails. Get that Title IX shit out of here. If the federal government cared about sexual assaults they would enforce this act. It is totally unbiased and is for the good of everyone. It is a farce to fight for prevention of sexual assault and ignore it, but that's you.
> net benefit to the economy of a country \n\nAhhh yes, the utilitarian metric of choice.\n\nThat pretty much sums things up. The poor make too much money and should pay for anyone else. They can afford to have the best healthcare? Fuck those people. What about everyone else? We should take their money until everyone else is paid for. That just about sums it up for me. If I'm not stealing from the rich to ensure equality then I'm not living up to my potential. Equality for me is taking from those who produce more and giving it to those who don't.\n\nUtilitarian views on the economy work when we talk about trying to bridge the gap between the por and the rich, but not when we look at the value the rich bring to society. Fuck those guys for being so good at bringing value to the economy.\n\nOh yeah, I'm against "foreign aid". Instead, I actually went on mission trips to Mexico and Guatemala. I personally funded those trips and spent the time to build houses and provide medical aid.\n\nDid you donate to foreign causes? How much money have you given to the poor. Don't respond to anything else. **How much money did you donate last year?** It's just so easy to raise taxes and force someone else to pay for things. It feels like you are really justified doesn't it?\n\n
I think it would be more entertaining to try and decipher his Spanish than his English. I can't even begin to imagine the crazy accent.
Heh. This is actually a great tidbit. Planned Parenthood is taking credit for the fact that we, the taxpayers, are funding them at the federal level. Why not just state that Medicare or ACA is the real reason it's $20? That's more than likely what she is paying for. It's just that Planned Parenthood is the provider she is paying...
So, you are pro-choice right? This issue with abortion isn't actually even about abortion at this point. Your argument is at it's core just a respect for relativism, which is inherently wrong. You wouldn't think that just because someone thought deeply about killing their boss that this then made them respectable when they decided they should do it. Would you?
I think it is important to note that the 4th amendment, the right of a person to be secure in their persons, papers, and effects, was passed largely because the British government were making up laws that practically no person could follow in order to justify aggressive policing policies. Make something trivial a crime and then use it as a stepping stone to do what they want.\n\nThat's pretty much what this video is.
What is your first language?\n\nThe Titanic was a ship that sank on it's maiden voyage in 1912. It was the largest ship ever built by man. The phrase means that even the greatest things that men can make are not safe from God.
> I believe that we should find out scientifically\n\n> where there's suffering\n\n> Now that's my view of course, I can see that you will not agree.\n\nLook to science. Pick an arbitrary metric. Decide what is right and wrong, but leave it to personal choice.\n\n> "scientific utilitarian relativist" is probably not too far off\n\nThat's you my man!\n\nLife begins at conception. I'm not in the business of deciding who is a human person or not. Do you have separate DNA and are living? Congratulations! You are a human person. Want to choose another metric? How about skin color, age, race developmental process, gender, or whatever else you can think of that has been used to justify horrific things all throughout time.
Of course sperm is alive, but it isn't a human. Is your hair human life? A person is alive when it's cells are replicating. There is an argument to be made that a person isn't dead until this entire process stops, but the majority of functions cease and everything begins to die at the state we see as dead (heart stops indefinitely). \n\n> 2) Thank you for assuming that you understand the rosiness of the world better than me without knowing anything about me.\n\nHave you ever been assaulted with a deadly weapon? Ever had to pull a gun on someone? Ever been stolen from and vandalized in the same week? Ever had to deal with a domestic violence disturbance? It's a bold assumption of me, but I'm sure it's true.\n\n> 3) Do you support sex ed and birth control?\n\nYes and it depends\n\n> 4) What exactly is your position? You want abortion to be completely banned? Allowed up to a certain stage? Only when the mother is at risk?\n\nCompletely outlawed except for extreme cases of life of the mother. Generally speaking, this would be maybe 100 per year in the US. It would involve some form of extraordinary circumstances.\n\n> 5) What solution do you propose if someone gets accidentally pregnant at 16 even with the use of contraception? She clearly won't be able to support the child or nurture him/her. What should she do? Be practical, people are going to have sex. You are going to ban pre-marital sex? What about couples who don't want to have children - will they live in a sex-less marriage?\n\nIf you don't want to bear the consequences of sex, then don't have it. Procreation is a possibility of sex. Welcome to the natural world.\n\nThe real struggle with the argument at hand is that your assumption is to do the "best" short-term solution. We don't have a consensus on sex. This will probably be very clear in what you write back. You don't believe sex is procreative in nature and you don't necessarily think premarital sex is wrong (or at least a majority of America doesn't). How can any sex-ed organization be tasked with comprehensive education when a majority of teachers, parents, and society do not believe in abstinence themselves? It's so easy to say that it doesn't work, but the root is that society doesn't really believe in it. It works if we wanted it to. We just don't. We want sexual freedom. We demand it. Then, when the consequences come we just start aborting babies.\n\n>  Though you don't care about what happens to a child once after he is born\n\nThis is entirely untrue and it's extremely untrue of the people who generally are against contraception. Only 2% of Catholics agree with the church on contraception. It's one of the only religions that hold that position. You will find that, like myself, those 2% are generous with their earnings, volunteer more than anyone else, and are constantly pushing for real social justice change.\n\nMillions of Pro-Choice marched for "women's rights". Why didn't they march for changes in foster care systems or adoption agencies. You are arguing right now about increasing funding to PP and contraception access in the US. Why not care for those children instead? You will find that the pro-life organizations don't do this. 40 days for life (which started in College Station, TX) protested until PP shut down in town and then rented the existing building to provide prenatal and maternal support for low-income mothers. They also provide an adoption agency and so much more.\n\nYou are trying to assert that the other side isn't doing anything. I haven't seen a single liberal push for legitimate social justice change.
Why protest for an unrealistic goal? Do you really believe that both Trump and Pence will ever resign? Even if it were to happen, next up is Paul Ryan followed by Rex Tillerson (soon), followed by even more Republicans. Is your goal really to have dozens of people all resign at once?\n\nPerhaps a goal of common ground might be more effective?
This is so fascinating to me. Why does society have to pay for a child because you had one? Can a mother with a 1 year old start complaining and decide society should pay for them?
Yes, but the monthly lot rent is very low. It averages around $300 for a nice park in and around Houston. You could imagine that land is only worth maybe $20,000 per lot at that rate. Thus, they are paying around $500 a year in property taxes per home. It's something, but that is nowhere near a normal residential property.
Why does someone have to draw the line? What if I wanted my house to have larger steps because I wanted a shorter staircase? What if I then sold it to someone else that also liked it.\n\nShould that be illegal? Do we really need someone regulating it?
> The vast majority of abortions are done prior to viability, \n> \n> NO one is getting elective abortions at 37 weeks.\n\nWhy did you say "vast majority" and then "no one". Wouldn't it be "no abortions" and "no one"? Why the difference here? I think we both know. Late-term abortions do happen.\n\n> Again, they do not perform elective abortions after the point of viability,\n\n[That's where you're wrong, kiddo.](https://www.google.com/search?q=late+term+abortion+legal+states&oq=late+term+abortion+legal+states&aqs=chrome.0.0l4.7868j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8) I don't want to spend too much time debating because I'm sure you will focus on the details to try and discredit something small, but late-term abortions are legal in states in the US and can be done for a broad array of unspecific reasons. Let's give an actual example:[ Dr. Ahern. He provides third trimester abortions for "psychiatric indication" of the mother. \n](http://www.drhern.com/en/abortion-services/third-trimester-abortion.html)\n> Life begins at first breath, according to your bible.\n\nCould I get a reference for this? My understanding is that God knew me as he formed me in the womb.\n\n> Anyone else's uterus (including your wife's!), none of your goddammed business, none of your say.\n\nI completely understand this argument. That's why I believe domestic violence isn't something the law should get into. If it isn't *your wife* then you don't get a say. I treat her how *I want*. Right? Or is there a moral justification for stopping people from doing back things to themselves and those closely related to them?
What are we protesting for? I'm generally interested. I tried learning more about the women's march but it seemed like there were no clear goals. Sure, everyone wants to protest against Trump, but what exactly are we against? He isn't going to be removed from office, but maybe we can change policy by policy.
You claimed 8 year olds are wanted. I'm giving you exact evidence that some are not. I've also suggested that poverty does not devalue life and encouraged you to interact with those who are in poverty to understand the root problem with your argument. Both seem irrelevant to you.\n\nThis is really digging at the problem with your argument. Poor people have less valuable lives than rich people. Yikes. I'm going to jump out on a limb and say that you've never interacted daily with those in extreme poverty. I encourage you to do so.\n\n> Thus you agree that not all lives are equal\n\nI think a better explanation would be to discuss the inherent value in life. Not all Rolex's are of equal value, but all are valued so highly that they should not be destroyed. Life is similar in that regard. All life is so valuable that it should not be destroyed, but some should be more protected (children being the most obvious to protect).\n\nThis final argument is really, really bad. A zygote isn't set to be a human person. It is. It is unique human DNA that is growing in a normal life cycle. A sperm and an egg are not unique DNA and thus are not a person. If we want to declassify a zygote as being a person I would love to have a discussion about the other kinds of people in various life stages that also shouldn't be considered a human person.
I do believe in souls, but the fundamental argument is the valuing of human life. You've said it yourself. A person who can't think or feel has no value and can thus be killed. I'm sure you believe in euthanasia. I don't. I believe that...\n\n> that we are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are **Life,** Liberty, and the Pursuit of Happiness
So, I am older and have completed more advanced degrees than you? You've worked a single job as a translator. Bravo my friend. You are on your way. Are you female or gay?\n\nReturn your business degree. If you think that utilizing the tax code is tax evasion, then you really haven't learned anything. If you think that abortion and healthcare are rights, then you don't understand the US Constitution. Finally, if you think that white people can't be racist, then you really do not understand the definition of racism and I encourage you to emigrate to a wonderful country like South Korea or Portugal where you can be happier. Portugal sounds like it will fit you well.\n\nI'm not sure what argument that you think you have won or made.  You don't have very concise points or a great grasp on them either way. You are a scientific utilitarian relativist. The worst of the worst my friend. Give it enough time. Cheers.
> semester of **human** physiology to understand the actual stages in the developmental progress of the mass of cells up to the point where it comes out of the mother\n\nThis is so fascinating to me. Someone should study human physiology so that he can better understand that the stage in human development you are referring to isn't really human at all? It's just so daft. How can you be so blinded?\n\n> and a course which teaches them how not to interfere in other lives.\n\nThis is so ignorant. Of course the state has a moral and legal obligation to stop murder if it so deems. You are intentionally killing another person because you "value" their life lower than another. I can't think of a more justified response from a lawmaker...\n\nBah. You don't care. It's your "right". The reality is **you need abortion**. You have to have it in order to have true sexual freedom because contraception isn't always used and sometimes fails. What then? Be burdened by poor decision making? Of course not. Just kill the kid and move on. Your life will be happier and you don't have to face yourself or the kid anyways. You are empowered. You are emboldened. This is your "right".\n\nIt's disgusting.
>  Just because abstinence works for some doesn't mean it will work for everyone and good to know how irresponsible you are\n\nYou don't think that abstaining from sex will keep you or anyone from getting pregnant? That just about sums it up for me. The part I don't get it how that makes me irresponsible for being responsible.\n\n> but It isn't murder of a living being.\n\nSo we are killing something that isn't alive? Is it dead?\n\n> How the fuck do you link not wanting children to suffer to not caring about them?\n\nThis is my favorite. You are legitimately saying that you don't want children to suffer so much that you are willing to kill them. How compassionate. How brave.\n\n> So adopt an older child and then open your mouth.\n\nCan you stop making these absurd claims that only the person who is actually doing something can have an opinion about morality. Have you ever murdered someone or been murdered? Then don't open your mouth about murder! Ha. Got ya. Right? It sounds like you are a child when you do that.
God. Why does every single subreddit have to be political. It's such a cancer.
Your post is actually quite comical. I can't really understand why pro-choice arguments are so blind. You aren't from the US (allegedly), but you love debating in US politics. That's as comical as your post.\n\n>You want everyone to be able to have as much sex as they want because it is "good"\n> > Stop putting words in my mouth.\n> > I support sexual freedom\n\nYou are arguing that what I am saying is wrong, but then agreeing with what I think your position is. This happens about 25% of the time on Reddit when I make this argument. It's quite comical, but sad and absurd at the same time. "Don't tell me what I think! That's what I think though!" Lol\n\n> You are unhappy because pro choice people are being responsible not to get pregnant when they aren't ready but still enjoying their life by having sex?...\n\n>  This is where sex ed and birth control comes in. In the odd cases where contraception fails and the parents aren't really ready to take on the responsibilities, a abortion in the early stages of pregnancy\n\n>  what good jobs can 16 year old do?\n\n* You want sexual freedom\n* You want to teach everyone via sexual education that sexual freedom is great, but to use contraception\n* You acknowledge that contraception fails\n* You acknowledge that teens (and maybe even young adults) are not financially and situationally ready to care for children\n\nBecause you agree with the list above and foundationally believe that sexual freedom is great and people should be "happy", we need abortion to ensure that they are able to do so. After all, we aren't killing children. We are killing a clump of cells that we can arbitrarily define as not a child. Here's a fun question for your argument about human life:\n\nA train is coming down the tracks. You can direct the train either toward a cow or a person. You can't choose neither. Is it morally wrong to save the cow instead of a person? If so, why?\n\nI've never had anyone answer that saving the cow was acceptable because humans are obviously more valuable than animals, but who knows with you! It has something to do with the intrinsic value of a human life that you conveniently want to forget about when abortion is on the table. Again, you need abortion to benefit society.\n\n>  your intent is coming from a frustrated position where you can't stand people exercising their choice.\n\nAbsolutely. People choose things every day. Today, someone is choosing to smoke crack or shoot heroine while they are pregnant. In a few months a baby will come out that is addicted to drugs with a liver that cannot process the drugs out of it's system efficiently. That child will cry every day for months on end being inconsolable. It is the choices we make every day that affect ourselves, others, and society at large.\n\nWhen you choose to have sexual freedom you are choosing to risk getting pregnant. For some, that risk is mitigated (but not removed) through contraception. Regardless, the act itself bears a statistical risk to bear a child. When that occurs society is faced with two options: Care for the child or destroy it. Your response is to declassify the life as something subhuman and destroy it "for the good of society". The worst part is that I am now expected to pay for people "exercising their choice" because it is "good" for society. I'm sorry friend. That's not some kind of just answer.\n\nI don't look at a pregnant crack addict and think about how happy that person must be as she is high as a kite. It's a high. It's a false good. In the same sense I don't look at sexual freedom and think how great it is that people can now find "happiness" and "meaning" through sexual deviancy. Sex is great. I'm married to the love of my life and enjoy my sexuality. We waited. If she gets pregnant we will happily have a child and hope to start having kids in a few years. The thought of children motivates us to be better people and it's a wonderful life. I encourage you to find that happiness and hope that everyone does.\n\nI just wish I didn't have to pay for your poor choices under the veil of "happiness". You don't have to pay for mine. Genuine happiness is free.
> Although Planned Parenthood does provide prenatal care services, those services are not a primary part of their operation.\n\n> for 2014-2015, they only provided 17,419 instances of prenatal care services (compared to 3,533,522 STD tests \n\nI appreciate that. I stand exactly where I stood in my original comment. They do not provide prenatal care at a majority of their locations.
Then make voucher programs for those that want them and public schools for those that want those. Why not both?\n\nStop and think for a second. We spend around $11k a year on average for a students education. Could you imagine the kind of schooling you could give a class of 20 for $220k a year? It's so preposterous to me. Give a voucher for $11k a student and more to those with disabilities and see what happens. People get really creative with money on the table and from my experience creativity is something public schools really lack.
You are far from alone. Over 50% of the people who are pregnant were using a form of birth control.
I would like to join the Green-Left Party. I am not aligned with them, but they are appear nice and genuine. I have a friend there.
Finally.
hello? I am a long-time lurker and created this Reddit account for the purposes of this SubReddit last year, but I never had the time. I am hoping to have some more time to commit now. \n\nIdeologically I fall at (5,-5) or so on the compass. Libertarians please :)

The ultimate irony is that Left-economics destroy the ability for further thrusts to the social Left.   \n  \n*It is a difficult problem!*
Whatever makes sense in the long term.
The irony is that the social atomisation resulting from such hideously hedonistic individualism would be antithetical to AnCapism and destroy it in short order. Culture being on the leash of the gene is banned discussion here!

Misportrayal of the relationship between Capitalism and Judaism (cf. Sand; Slezkine; MacDonald; Mullen; Harpending; Wade)   \n  \nMisportrayal of the relationship between Communism and Jews (cf. Paczkowski et al; Verlag; *loc cit*)   \n  \nSilly and spurious arguments: "Why haven't they killed...?"  \n   \nThe idea that races have equal abilities athletically or that consensus is proof. Africans have higher centres of mass, more fast-twitch muscle and differing muscular structure, denser bones, smaller lungs, narrower hips, proportionally longer legs, ACTN-3, &c. which allow for better running ability.  \n  \nAnd then genocide, which can be justified based on that "those who are unwilling to make calculated losses will lose all." 
And mandatory debt payments become an issue as well. It's no coincidence that Democrats attempt deferral more often. 
They absolutely do. Without them, or some form of incremental suppression, society will enter a dysgenic period and decline.  \n  \nAt times physical removal is justified, at other times sterilisation, and in most times incremental suppression ought to be used.
> I have never heard of Volker's cycle of civilizations and didn't find anything on google about it, would you mind expanding?\n\nIt's quite likely my fault, as it was *[Volkmar](https://goo.gl/6OIBDt)*, and not Volker.  \n  \nIt's essentially the same as that shown by Glubb, Strauss, de Gobineau, Bannon, Howe, Aristotle, Plato, or Polybius.  \n  \n>Like what?  \n  \nThe social, political, religious, and biological, all of which are interrelated.  \n  \n>Also the use of degenerate builds on the idea that what's considered normal matters.  \n  \nYes, what is considered normal does matter, most certainly. Without a conception of normality which is necessarily productive there would not be civilisations. There has never been any civilisation which has not died shortly after the cascade to value nihilism.  \n  \n>Even if it did, to me a degenerate is a different thing than to you  \n  \nIt would be quite upsetting if your values were diametrically opposed to mine, which are civilisational. This would imply you are wholly against civilisation which makes your entire argument fallacious by way of the stolen concept fallacy.   \n  \nI (and most people) value intelligence, honesty, strength, virtue, and the ethics which each successful society has used as their base. Those that oppose this really do have no long-term reasoning for their beliefs and are nearly always going to be nihilists or hedonists, both of which lead to the demise of a given society.  \n  \n>because every social circle and culture have their values.  \n  \nWhich is why societies have centers and common beliefs, cultures, traditions, histories, languages, and ethnic makeup. When they are heterogeneous in this way, they collapse.  \n  \n>It's not silly because it's obvious to you. I disagree with your notion.  \n  \nIt's silly because it is what should be obvious to everyone. Anyone that really wishes to deny that drugs are bad for personal health, economic productivity, job, career, or achievement performance, or other aspects of life has loose screws and is probably a low-achiever to boot!  \n  \n>Alright, you are free to choose that as your values.  \n  \nWhich implies you value freedom.  ^1\n  \n>I choose compassion and empathy to be promoted above all  \n  \nYes, Haidt discovered in 2008 that Leftists tend only to select two moral values, leading to destructive morality -; immorality to those situated more on the Right.  \n  \n  \nWith this in mind, empathy and compassion are greatest in northern Europe where selection was strongest, eugenics the greatest (thanks manorialism) and social mores had the strongest ability to compel. This led to the creation of the most altruistic ethnies, embodying your primary traits if only by way of the others which allowed them to exist in the first place. You cannot have some without others.    \n  \nA failure to address ^1 means that you will restrict freedom in the long sense in caring for degenerates. You must make the concession sooner or latter or take the final quite objectionable option and die.\n  \n>intelligence, good health and productivity to be promoted in all cases where it does not interfere with the promotion of the other 2.  \n  \nThen, if you were the king as it were, your society would die. It's an old adage that those unwilling to make calculated losses will lose all, and your values - if intransigent - are opposed to the biology necessary for any advanced society to last for a sufficiently long period and at any great level of prosperity.  \n  \n>As I said, we value different things to different degrees, and it doesn't mean either of us are wrong, we just have different priorities.  \n  \nSure enough this can be said of anything, as all philosophies which fail to establish a base circle the drains of nihilism and hedonism respectively. With this in mind, your philosophy is anti-civilisational, anti-social, and exists in opposition to prosperity, especially for your own posterity.   \n  \nIf nothing matters for you (beyond the petty "compassion and empathy...") then you will find the necessary qualities to bring those about lacking in short order. It is a mere impossibility for the biologically weak to produce something of use to the world.   \n  \n  \nTo be clear: neither of us are 'wrong' as it were, but if you wish to have a society and for it to be prosperous then you are 100% wrong.

>What benefit do you see in imprisoning addicts?  \n  \nThe reduction in genes related to addiction, even though - for example - alcoholism is related to a gene I quite like in the case of OCA2-HERC2.  \n  \n>How about people that are addicted to currently legal substances, like Vicodin or Oxycodone?  \n  \nThem as well, yes. There is a reason I said that drugs should be decriminalised and it lies mostly in the fact that the state has little ability to handle drugs, at least efficiently or without large-scale killings a la Duterte (not opposed, entirely).
My family in SC said there were quite a few Libertarians but still no major parties. Just too many shitskins/Nordestinos looking for gibs? 
The majority of people in many supposedly Democratic regimes do not regard their government in power as legitimate or ostensibly as a personification of their nationhood (cf. the Trump election). The idea that power is borrowed from the people is only true insofar as the people are the ones conducting the motions power works through, otherwise, legitimacy isn't a great issue.

This is obvious and debate of it is silly.   \n  \nThe usage of drugs which is met with addiction indicates people predisposed to it, which would undoubtedly (cf. productivity losses) cut into their value had both nominally and produced.   \n   \n>ad populum   \n  \nQuite the contrary! Though a society may hold values quite widely, it is only through their promotion by elites that they've met such preponderance.   \n  \nOf course nowadays what values I've just espoused are decidedly against the norm, at least of legislation, and doesn't fit in contemporaneously where it does traditionally.   \n  \nWith this in mind, your statement is; A) antithetical to law which supposes a center and objective for obvious reasons, and; B) ignorant in the highest because in all, things must be a matter of opinion. Somewhere we must decide what is good and what is bad and they cannot be justified by reason not stemming, at least by some tangent, from what is considered an objective base in one way or another. By this, I choose intelligence, good health, productivity, beauty, and happiness to be promoted and idiocy, bad health, malaise, and depression to be dispromoted.   \n  \nBeauty is noted because it does - again - derive itself culturally and from a base which for any Nation to exist must be had; this holds with less centralisation in the case of countries and states.      
The gender wage gap is based on differences in hours worked, worker skill, employment position, labor force participation, choice (maternity leave, "mommy route," job choice (how many women are freight workers?), &c.) and the results of differences between men and women, not on discrimination in any manner whatsoever. Men and women make just as much in the same jobs normally (Equal Pay Act of 1963 for Americans), but women don't tend to do the same jobs or simply can't do them for a variety of reasons.  \n  \n!AgreeWithOP

>I am unconvinced. Why would anyone have a responsibility to right some past wrong because of the way they were born?  \n  \nNo one said they did.

It has happened before.  \n  \n>Further, good and evil are qualities of behavior and are not at all what I am talking about, unless you mean that there are particular involuntary groups that are inherently evil?  \n  \nWhat constitutes good and bad? Traditionally to be good was to be noble, to be confident, masculine, and generally great. Bad is to be simple (schlecht and schlicht), poor, weak, dim, &c.  \n\nThe traditional structure and connotation in this dichotomy shows up in all Indo-European languages and cultures that speak them.  \n   \nThere are many bad qualities which are involuntary. The ugly, the dim, the weak, the excessively sweaty, those with addiction problems, early baldness, &c.  As a result, they may be quashed and removed from possibility in the next generation.  \n  \n>If so, which ones?  \n  \nObviously those ones which are conducive to civilisation and represent the general value structures of the peoples within them.  \n  \nTo make this clear (as it is to all but the most autistic): all advanced societies value intelligence over idiocy, strength over weakness, honesty over treachery, kindness over indolence, love over hate and so on. People that have it within them only to belong to the latter of those characteristics ought to be forbidden or suppressed in their breeding.

I am discussing actual voting not migration ('voting with your feet').  \n   \n Freedom should be obvious and is explicated well in books like *Capitalism and Freedom*; I don't need to say more, especially in this sub.   \n  \nA person voting away freedom could be exampled by those voting for larger government in the way of regulations, social programs, and the abrogation of what are considered natural rights like the freedom of association. It being more free compared to their country of origin is a non-starter here. Immigrants, especially non-White immigrants, vote overwhelmingly for larger government and a reduction in freedom in this manner.   
Baseless conjecture and an outright lie at that.   \n  \nIt happened in every nation with an average IQ above 95 consistently, from China to every European nation within Hajnal. Yet, if your retarded lie were true they would have less genetic diversity, correct? Wrong! They (Hajnal insiders) have the highest genetic diversity in the world on average. (inb4 West Africa bs)   \n  \nThe typical source for this is Clark's *A Farewell to Alms.*  \n  \nWithout this happening, we would still live in a dark age with a very low population, worse health, more disease vulnerability, lower intelligence, &c.

>That is very subjective.  \n  \nNot at all. What I said was "Genocide is justified where otherwise a society would die."  \n  \nSubjective statement? No.   \n  \nThe reasons a society may die?

Why would this be (why would this be immediate?)? Withal, it's clear you haven't; A) listened to, or; B) read; any Hitler. Saying (and I know this was Goebbels) that humanity would enter a dull state and that the systems in place would run themselves into an abyss is not incorrect, it's visible most everywhere, really.  \n  \nWhat this was, was a misdirection. What does Hitler being right have to do with the *fact* that genocide (in various forms) must be done for societies to be preserved in the long-run?

>That is a very broad set of individuals and beliefs. You'll be hard pressed to find any sort of agreement on what is a value they'd be willing to uphold. As you see, your own idea has at least one vocal critic and 10 implied ones. How is anyone going to agree?  \n  \nBecause we do have large agreement. Most people do agree that ill health, frailty, and stupidity are bad things. This is very simple and denying as much is just silly.  \n  \n>So we're going to remove reproductive rights from 'unintelligent, weak, unhealthy, and unproductive people'?  \n  \nThis is ideal, yes.  \n  \n>Are people with genetic markers for mental health also weak and unhealthy?  \n  \nDepends on the issue, but likely yes.  \n  \n>Where's the cutoff for the unintelligent?  \n  \nBelow the current mean. As the mean increases we will re-evaluate, but re-norming doesn't really matter and is a non-point (although some people tend to believe the test magically upends itself based on the new mean haha).  \n  \n>It says that people who have molested children fit the DSM category of pedophilia 16.2% of the time. That is, they have a physiological, excitatory, reaction to pictures of children in sexual situations. Which means that 80+% of the time people that sexually molest children are not necessarily pedophiliacs as described by the DSM. But fit other categories such as 'alcohol abuse/dependence, sexual dysfunction, personality disorder, increased aggressiveness, mental deficit, etc.'  \n  \nThey still; A) raped, and; B) had sex with a child. This constitutes quite enough for me to see them persecuted. If they have poor impulse control and are alcoholics then the case only becomes stronger as both of these traits are genetically derived as well.  \n  \n>Yet you are arguing that these people should be removed from reproductive rights because 16.2% of the time they also molest children sexually. With the understanding that such a removal will extricate the genes from the available pool of people that give rise to 'unwanted' thoughts and 16.2% of the time actions.  \n  \n100% of people that molest children are bad people. There is no excuse for molesting a child. If you got drunk and did it, that doesn't excuse a thing and it still shows you as quite likely unfit.  \n  \n

Ignoring them will necessarily lead to calamity. Any society which reduces its powers of discrimination will fail to understand 'good' and 'bad' in short order and will be left desolate as a result.

There is no way in which IQ measures motivation despite having marked co-variation with the trait.
Certainly nothing broad enough to say I'm in the top 2 million without immense doubt, I'm assuming. 
>How are traits deemed unwarranted?  \n  \nTypically by civilisational values, as is extremely obvious to the majority of people. No society wants unintelligent, weak, unhealthy, and unproductive people so to assume anything other than that is likely to stand against it.  \n  \n>I'd also like to point out that you cannot achieve a significant reduction in child molestation with this approach. As per a fellow redditor:   \n  \nNot at all what that says, actually.  \n  \nAll it says is that paedophiles only fit the DSM qualification as paedophiles some 1/6 of the time. They still act as paedophiles in the only sense which matters - the practical one - and they show weak impulse control, which is largely genetic and worth curtailing, similarly. Also: most criminals ought to be sterilised.
>German and Italian immigrants were not detained under the same parameters as the Japanese.  \n  \nNo one said otherwise. In-fact, I stated otherwise explicitly and explained the reasoning.  \n  \n>The state detained an entire race of people, while the German and Italian population was screened and under specific suspicions of collusion.   \n  \nWhich was something I recognised and explained. Did you not read my comment at all?  \n  \n>If rights can be [rescinded] for an entire race then why shouldn't you simply exterminate them?  \n  \nUp to you. I would rather see them interned until the problem is passed, but if you're reading to rev up the gas chambers that works too. It's a matter of ethics, like most things, obviously.  \n  \n>It surely would be more practical, effective and less expensive. Since they don't have rights.  \n  \nThere is certainly an economic argument for the mass extermination of immigrants, but I'm not likely to make it any time soon.     \n  \n>Irrelevant since on the before and during the war a significant proportion of German Americans were against the war despite being rooted in America for multiple generations.  \n  \nNo, completely relevant as it exposes why they may have been further integrated than Japanese immigrants. This is an explication of detail wholly relevant to the subject at hand and to say otherwise is to totally dismiss everything that has been said.  \n  \nBut, you didn't even read it.  \n  \n>So because people were unwilling or to lazy to examine individuals values and views its assumed that they hold similar values and views. This is an indefensible and ineffective guideline.  \n  \nNon-sequitur, but lets address your point anyway.  \n  \nPeople were *unable* to ascertain the precise views of many thousands of people in a potentially dire situation in which terror could have begun any moment, yes. This is very simple and an extremely sensible course of action especially when the apparatus that would have conducted such examinations was fighting in the Pacific and European theatres at the time - they were a bit short on manpower!  \n  \n>History does not support this claim what so ever.  \n  \nYou are lying. History most certainly supports racial differences and greater collectivism amongst Orientals.  \n  \n>The majority of Japanese immigrants and American born citizens were completely willing to adopt American values almost immediately.  \n  \nSimple unprovable statement.  \n  \n>The 442nd infantry regiment is evidence of this.  \n  \nIn no way at all.  \n  \n>An all volunteer force made of US born Japanese.  \n  \nSome men volunteered so an entire race must have the characteristics of those people that made the choice to volunteer. That's your implication. That's imbecilic.  \n  \n>Many more volunteers were turned away because they didn't fit the narrow requirements for service which suggests that the culture within the Japanese immigrant population was in support of the US.  \n  \nUnprovable and irrelevant. A few volunteers doesn't reduce possibility and magic dirt doesn't change their genetics.  \n  \n>Look at how the Japanese immigrants culture changed following the war and their release, reparations took a back seat in most families. Instead japanese families cast off the vast majority of their home culture and adopted the American values.  \n  \nLittle Tokyo still exists. They are a collective and most of them (according to Forbes) have friend groups primarily composed of other Orientals.  \n  \n>Many families that came from those who were detained were not taught their native language and cultural history because adopting American culture was the priority.  \n  \nGreat, so it wouldn't have been possible to apprehend their riskiness or not anyway. You've supported me here, I suppose!   \n  \n>If geographical location correlates with animosity towards the US I would like to see the research.  \n  \nThat wasn't what I said :)  \n  \nI said that their location presented greater risk, as they were neared to several military and naval installations and potential targets, concentrated in urban centers, and very largely a risk factor based on their distribution.  \n  \n>If physical proximity to the enemy is the issue then the Germans and Italians on the east coast we're just as suspect to collusion.  \n  \nNot so much for reasons previously stated and the logistics of their distributions.  \n  \nYou didn't read what I said :'(\n
I got this: yes. 
It's a way to signal OP's virtuosity. 
It isn't. 
There is a Kurdish nation yet no Kurdish state. You can most certainly have the former without the latter. 
>this is not what happened to the Japanese and so is really incomparable.  \n  \nThey were not interned without being sentenced to specific crimes? Most certainly were.  \n  \n>Earlier /u/curveball14 proposed that this was not effective and proposed that the internment of an entire race was necessary.  \n  \nIt was entirely necessary - war commands action.  \n  \n>/u/curveball14 is advocating the detention of an entire race because they are a the same race as the enemy (with some caveats I assume).  \n  \nThat's a perfectly fine thing to do and it is likely the safest course of action, especially given the circumstances.  \n  \n>What is the justification for not taking all Germans and Italians in America and placing them in internment camps or deporting them?\n  \n  \nSeveral situation-dependent facts which should be obvious, but I will explicate in short: 1) integration - Germans and Italians both; A) came earlier (on average), and; B) were closer to the primary race, thus making integration easier and animosity against them which would spark the resent expected a lesser possibility. Additionally, suppression efforts work better for them since they can better identify with the natives already here, which the Japanese could not do, and;   \n  \n2) collective attitudes - anyone caring to recognise the global distribution of collectivist versus individualist attitudes will note that Europeans are the most individualist and the Orient is especially famed for their collectivism and racial, ethnic, familial, &c. loyalty, thus logically making their chances of defecting or abetting the enemy greater than European types, alongside;   \n  \n3) location - the Germans were (and are) primarily situated in the mid-west, while the Italians were primarily on the east coast and the Japanese were almost entirely on the west coast. With the Japanese where they were, it makes sense that it would be far easier for them to act as; A) spies, and; B) saboteurs, and; C) terrorists (against military targets and urban centres), at least as compared to the Germans and Italians whom were further from the key military positions of their respective theatres and more likely under stricter authorities.  \n  \nThese three reasons (out of MANY more) should suffice.

>So do all you motherfuckers  \n  \nWho?  \n  \n>have a set criteria in whether a genocide is justified or not?  \n  \nLess strictly than the *zú zhū*, but moreso than Hitler's eugenics courts *a la Into the Darkness*.   \n  \nGenocide is justified where otherwise a society would die.
Yep. Their major models are mostly from the southeast and of German ancestry.  
>Id never heard this before, could you elaborate?  \n  \nJews are as adapted for Capitalism as West-Africans are for sprinting and East-Africans for the marathon, which is to say, *well*.  \n  \nTo illustrate this point, note that there are around 15 million Jews (0,002% of the global population) and they represent 11,6% of world billionaires (Forbes), 48% of US billionaires, 32% of those on the *Forbes Magazine* list of the 400 wealthiest Americans, are more than twice as likely as the American average to be college graduates, represent around a third of all faculty at the 17 most prestigious universities in the USA (Lynn, 2011), 50% of the top intellectuals in terms of journal publishings, 56% of top social scientists, 61% of the leading voices in the humanities, and 52% of Pulitzer (also Jewish) Prize winners. They own and preponderantly staff the majority of newspapers in the US (Pierce, 1978), have founded several of Hollywood's most major film studios, are 30% of the "media elite", 46% of Hollywood TV directors and 66% of producers, eight of the top ten entertainment companies are staffed by them, of the 34 most influential pepole in the media 48% are Jews, and they are - of course - disproportionately politically involved.  \n  \nJews are excellently adapted to Liberalism. Slezkine, Sand, and Samuel (all Jews) call it the "Jewish Spirit."  \n  \n>Do smaller lungs really make for better running ability? Im not so sure about this.  \n  \nThey don't assist, but beyond that they (along with the denser bones and higher centres of mass) help to explain why Blacks don't medal in swimming events very often.  \n  \n>Due to this the best and brightest African Americans tend to go into sports  \n  \nThe intelligence of college athletes is notoriously low. Blacks are also not represented evenly in terms of positions in major sports by any means. They will tend to dominate those positions most associated with speed, but not those associates with dexterity or any somesuch.   \n  \n>business where being connected is far more important than actual talent  \n  \nThis is not really true, only becoming more so. So many people say it as a truism, but few can back it up. What's really evident is that there's bias and it's a result of entrenchment, regulating, and nepotism largely on the parts of Jews and other ethnocentrist groups that look to select from their own.  \n  \n>Not due to some kind of genetic differences.  \n  \nSociologist's Fallacy, really.
Hazlitt's *Economics in One Lesson* and Friedman's *Capitalism and Freedom* are both good as well. For more of the philosophy of freedom Bastiat's *The Law* is great. 
Many Germans and Italians were - quite rightfully - interned and their cultures were suppressed domestically. 
Missing the point?
Morals do not exist without a biological basis. People dislike incest because we've evolved to have an instinct against it in the same way that we tend to have an instinct against outbreeding. Whatever justification people use now is just an extrapolation from that more rudimentary instinct, however unsavoury that may be to some wishing to see us as somehow above instinct.

My Miyota quartz movement has been having some issues, and since they are dirt cheap, I decided to take the thing apart to learn how a quartz movement works. I was surprised at the complexity of a quartz movement, I always imagined them being even simpler than this. \n\nI want to take apart a mechanical movement too, but I'm not willing to sacrifice one of my Seikos. This movement didn't work before I took it apart and I wasn't able to fix it by putting it all back together so I'm worried about taking apart a movement I care about and destroying it. All in all this was a fun late night project! 
Never said it was a programming language, it's a markup or display language
I would have said no a year ago, but since [these](https://www.alohaz.com/collections/pali-hawaii-sandals) became popular I welcome the sight of Birks.\n\nI would get sperrys instead, but I'm not a sandals guy :/
This bothered me too, glad to know there are some in the sign & graphics industry who wouldn't let this slide
Okay... Program an intel 8086 CPU with magic the gathering cards and get back to me. Programming language is a specific thing, touring complete is a feature.

Your villainy is millions of american's heroics. Instead of pointing the finger try to understand where they are coming from. To them you are the movie villain.
I don't know anymore, after reading all these comments I am starting to suspect that it is only the schools I have attended. Talking to people in my Calc II class though the HS calc didn't come close to preparing the students.
> It seems to me like Trump wants to push policy without actually going through the process of creating legislation.  \n\nCompletely agree. I also think the executive branch has gotten too powerful and congress has gotten too divided. Remember when bills went through congress and were debated and voted on by our representatives? Those were the days...
BC only covers the first part of Calc II. In California at least you cannot take Calc III out of HS, you have to take Calc II.
This should be the message that California broadcasts to the world, "everything is terrible! Stay away!". Less people moving here...
Yes...
Damn dude! Good for you!
It is! A great place to visit... unless you are Mormon in which case it is heaven 
None! I were dress shirts and nice pants to work everyday, and our manager wore suits. But our best engineer wore cargo pants and flip flops. My experience and from talking to others is that if you aren't customer facing its pretty much whatever you want to wear will work.
Ahh, that would make sense!
Calc II or III?
You have 4 members in your group, I have 256. 1 person from your group dies, 64 from my group die. You are 64 times more likely to die being in my group... But the disease killed 25% of the population in both cases. \n\nI can compare two different things, you are correct, but the results are meaningless.\n\nAnother example comparing the groups, your group of 4 finds it very easy to decide where to get dinner. My group of 256 finds it very difficult. You say how horrible my group is for taking so long at deciding dinner, ignoring things like group composition, group size,  availability of restaurants, decision strategy ect.\n\nSo no... you cannot compare Denmark to the USA like this site does

Sure, but I would put it on your resume. If the hiring people know anything about debugging and database reconciliation they will ask specific questions, otherwise if you can talk about challenges you faced and how you solved them that's more important that having them look at the source code
Waiting for explosion... \n\nedit: dissapointed
Absolutely, but there are so many things to criticize about all ideologies. Both sides are guilty of falling into the "They are the bad guy" trap that they become numb to anything the other side has to say, and viciously attack anyone who doesn't agree with them.\n\n> "Liberals feel that they must protect individuals from themselves. As a conservative I say, leave me alone & let me die if I choose."\n\nI absolutely agree, I think if more people understand this we can start having better conversations. Neither side is wrong or evil (there are defiantly people on each side who are wrong or evil), and we must accept ideological differences to move forward.\n\nAlso not basing political opinions off misleading headlines would be nice. I have seen some wacky misleading headlines in right and left wing subreddits and people just blindly accept them as fact without reading into the complexities. 
Literally just google touring completeness. Let me help you though\n\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_completeness\n\nhttp://stackoverflow.com/questions/7284/what-is-turing-complete\n\nhttp://wiki.c2.com/?TuringComplete\n\nThis is some CS 101 shit

I think this refers more to Obama's drone strikes than to bush's invasion. The Obama administration had a tendency to kill specific targets in a similar set of countries, resulting in a lot of civilian casualties.

No, it doesn't... it means following a table of rules you can compute things with it. Programming languages are used for programming computers. They are related, but not the same, it's like how a square is a rectangle but not all rectangles are squares. The square is programming languages and the rectangle is touring completeness

His dad taught him to fix them.

This! they also got sued by Costco and Trader Joe's in a monopoly lawsuit claiming that the state of Utah has a monopoly on liquor sales. All liquor is sold through state stores and they are sin taxed like crazy.

I have never heard of someone taking Calc III after BC but it does look like that would work... Maybe its just my college that doesn't allow it or maybe its rare. Some colleges appear to let you go straight into Calc II but I have never seen it. I didn't take AB or BC, I just took the college calc classes. The other thing all of my teachers have talked about is how the AB and BC classes don't really prepare students for college calc even if they get 5s on the AP tests. My old university let you jump into Calc II but it was recommended that you re-take Calc I. Not sure if that was for AB only or if you took both.\n\nMy friend took Calc II with me and struggled (got an A though) throughout the entire course despite taking AB and BC in high-school.
It depends, always on freeways. When there is a carpool lane it becomes the first non-carpool lane from the left. On 2 lane roadways this usually isn't the case like it is on freeways, but check local laws. (Mainly because there are lots of left turn lanes) I know in California it is only freeways and highways with more than two lanes, not main roadways and parkways even if there are tons and tons of lanes. It is infuriating how many people break this rule in California.\n\nIt is polite to stay to the right even on a two lane road but its not always practical. Also in heavy traffic use whatever lane you like, including the left because it eases congestion to have all the lanes filled. :)
I'm disappointed it's not a mini
Some republicans (especially Trump) want to circumvent the 60 votes they need in the senate... I really hope they don't do this, as it has been a theme of the subreddit that implementing powers like that are good when "your guy" is in power, but are dangerously overreaching when he isn't. I'm happy the majority leader is against it.
Arguing on the internet has resulted in zero injuries thus far, I say I'm doing pretty good for myself
I up-voted this! But not the post
Is CSS programming now?\n\nEdit: To all the webdevs who think writing CSS is programming, sorry... at least writing things in JS is considered programming because it's a PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE and the code can be executed to do something. \n\nCSS is a Description Language, like markdown and xml, it is read by a program that uses the information to display things on the screen. CSS isn't capable of interacting with the underlying hardware on its own like JS, java, python, and C can do. \n\nWriting CSS code is as close to programming as typing an essay in Word or formatting a document in tex

Too bad that won't get my tax dollars back 😡 
Terrorism is complicated. But i think your right that it had very little to do with our involvement in the Middle East. I was thinking more along the lines of troops, but I think you are right that we would be attacked by terrorism regardless. I doubt that we would be attacked more or less by radicalized terrorists no matter what we do in the Middle East.

She has spent a lot of time working with children and schools... it's been her thing for a long time. And I would much rather have her than someone who has 0 experience with americas school system and thinks it's going great. We got common core with Bush and not much of anything under Obama, at least she has a vision of the future where children can go to the schools that fit their specific needs most. Watch her confirmation hearing, she is more competent and understands the system better than headlines and sound bites will lead you to believe\n\nWhat debate is she unaware of?
I want to print this out and frame it because it's funny as fuck.
Regardless, I don't think a 25 billion dollar wall is going to stop much illegal immigration, regardless of who pays for it and the resulting economic fallout, which you seem to know more about than me. Hopefully he changes his mind and only does a section or so

I think its important to note that the stay was held not because blocking people from entering the country is unconstitutional, but because they argued (slight paraphrasing here) that he doesn't get the power to control immigration unchecked. Which I take to mean they would need house, senate, or judiciary approval before enacting such a ban. Someone with more knowledge in this subject can correct or add to this.\n\nLike him or hate him, I think you can make the argument that the executive branch has been gaining too much power since the 80s-90s and seeing a federal court check that power makes me happy inside (the government is actually working... shocker! :O  )\n\nHere is an article that I think summarizes the tone of the ruling fairly well: http://www.economist.com/blogs/democracyinamerica/2017/02/see-you-court I had to look some words up from the excerpt, judges like flowery language. I have seen a lot of places saying it wasn't lifted because the ban was unconstitutional, and while you could make that argument (that the constitution establishes separation of powers and he violated that,) the implication is that it is unconstitutional to block people from entry which is not true.\n\nPlease don't dig me into a downvote hole :S
I just watched the podcast with Shane smith and he said he didn't want to be president of the world, im guessing he wouldn't want to be president of the US either
I must re-iterate, if you don't understand the motivations of the other side they look criminal. If you read conservative points of views you will better understand their ideology and be better able to work towards compromises in political discourse.\n\nFor example, I have never met someone who thinks that god has given them the right not to be taxed, and therefore want poor people to die. The republicans have real (arguably misguided) complaints about the ACA, and want to replace it with something (they think is) better. They want to help un-insured american's just like everyone else, but by demonizing them you won't be offered a seat at the table and your legitimate concerns will never be heard.
Hopefully this resolves "google chrome helper"

In fact no where on any of those pages do they make the claim that touring complete == programming language

Yes, it would still apply. You fight ideas, not people. The initiation of physical political violence is terrorism. Words and movements are not violence. People have the ability to act independently and to make their own free choices.

So just to be clear here... Bernie Sanders... an American politician, has nothing to do with American politics? Just making sure I have got that correct. And with a title: "Maybe Bernie does have a point after all? - Living in the US compared the living in Denmark" which implies a political stance that Bernie Sanders, who I must re iterate, is an **American politician**, has a better **political** outlook than his opponents. \n\nJust making sure that American political views **are not** politics.\n\nAlso, just realized you violate rule 7 as well, and it violates rule 1, specifically parts 3 and 4 [link](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/wiki/index#wiki_what_is_a_data_visualization)\n\nedit: You broke rule 3 too.

I used to have some Soul 7s, maybe one day I will have a Rolex too :)
I lean further right every day, not because I necessarily agree with the right, but I don't want to be associated with the left.
I agree. We have to get people elected to their state governments and then elected to higher offices. The LP is focused on this. It's the population at large that can't seem to move past getting our President in power first. That's probably not going to happen. He would have no coalition. It would be an epic fail.
That is disgusting.

Why are people cheering on the intelligence community? Why? Why? Why? These are the people that would require you to wear a camera and record your every move if we let them have their way. Down with big government and three letter agencies. What the IC is doing is scary. They are not fucking in charge of this country. I didn't vote for Trump, but I support him going after these people for leaking to the press what they had already given to the Justice Department to handle.
Not only ask for them, but store them in a database.

That looks wonderful.

The President is asking for his cyber security experts to tell him what they think needs to be done in order to secure the internet from foreign and domestic hack-a-thons. There's nothing bad about it and it needs to be done. 
So we can make fun of little kids on the internet, they just can't be Barron Trump? Got it.

Just because a communist/socialist doesn't see their own shortcomings doesn't mean capitalists can't use their own quotes against them.
No. We post how dumb both sides are. You can only adequately post one photo at a time.

Maybe they are holding that sign because they think it's bad policy to bomb 7 countries and not let in any refugees as a consequence.   
Parent's date night would be over after pulling that shit. That's not even remotely funny. Good God. 
I did the same thing, but with dog shit.
Seems more like a Comrade to me.
This happened to the woman that cleaned our house when I was growing up. I was raised by a single working mom and she hired a woman to come clean every other week. This woman looked pregnant. She was skinny everywhere else, but her stomach. Years later she found out it was a tumor. She died, but I can't remember if it was related to the tumor.
Am I the only person that feels really bad for the seals? Also...they are fucking huge.
ISIS is using every single thing Trump has done since in office as a recruiting tool. They aren't evening adding their own comments to it. They are just sharing it from their social media platforms and websites without comment. I'm sure this is one of the things they will use. \n\nEdit for grammar.
Putin animal memes never get old. I absolutely adore them.
This is a monolith placed there by a supremely advanced alien race as a way to nudge along the evolution of humans. That first encounter with a monolith gave our ancient ancestors the knowledge to use tools.  Next, we found a monolith on the moon that pointed us toward Jupiter (and may have given us the ability to create artificial intelligence). Finally, in 2001, we reached the third monolith and watched as it transformed into the next stage of human evolution, the Star Child.
If you wonder if a woman is ovulating ask to check her cervical mucus. Make sure to ask. We like it when you ask first.

I agree with what the right would do had this been Obama, but it's still not scary.
When my husband and I bought our first home 3 years ago, the first thing I did was create a garden for honey bees. I was so disappointed because the first two years garnered a plethora of pollinators, but no honey bees. This past season was the first year we'd had honey bees. It was so exciting.
INCOMING!!!!!
It's less about stopping immigration, than keeping undesirable elements out and destroying the black market. Libertarians know you need a fresh influx of people to keep an economy strong. We just don't need drug lords, human traffickers and gangs.
Nazi's were socialists. National socialists. They had no problem helping their fellow man as long as they were Aryan.
Go back and look at the photo now. He fixed it.
Listening to someone speak is not the same as supporting them. I see a lot of people that have likely never even heard Milo speak putting words into his mouth because someone on tv/the internet told them what to think about him. He is a shock jock type like Ann Coulter. Neither one are in charge of anything and they can't make changes to your life just from speaking. Listening to them and learning how they think is the best way to combat their type of thinking. They also sometimes have very valid points mixed in. I don't go listen to people that only say things I 100% agree with. That sounds boring. I want to go hear the guy talk that people are protesting about. That sounds like a much better time.\n\nLibertarians are never going to see violence as a tool unless it's for the defense of yourself or your property. We follow a non-aggression policy. So, it sounds like you agree with us on that point.
PLEASE CALL THE POLICE!!!
Fire extinguisher in the back cause bitches fittin to get lit. 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
No one would stop anyone from helping other people. You do realize that the government is just made up of people, right? You would still have churches, etc. America is the most generous country on Earth and that generosity would increase if people thought the government wasn't handling everything. The gov already give grants to nonprofits to do the work people thibk the gov is doing. The govetnment literally just takes your money and passes it around. You're an adult, can you not decide how to allocate your money to best meet the needs of your community?
Or wallpaper paste.
Oh, God, it's ear holes are on full display. It is so ugly.

I have tried to find a reason that I would burn something down over this guy and I just can't. He's more likable than Ann Coulter. He's a shock jock. He's saying crazy things because he knows it will cause a stir. He has the right and this is nuts.
Take human shit & add it to your soil. Light the soil on fire. Plant egg seeds.

I get that people who use a gun everyday as a tool would not want this, but that doesn't mean that other people would not. The idea that because this gun goes to market soon all guns will be required to be fitted with this technology is ridiculous. Sure, the gun has flaws, but let's let the free market decide.
Agreed. It's a crap situation. Regardless of how much care you take to not get pregnant some women are going to end up with accidental pregnancies at some point. After inception there are ultimately 4 outcomes: 1) the woman wants the baby, but the man doesn't; 2) the man wants the baby, but the woman doesn't; 3) they both don't want the baby; 4) they both want the baby. If you try to make it fair after conception it will never work out except for option 3 & 4. Option 1 & 2 leave someone losing rights if the other takes action, so yes, the only way to keep control of the situation is before you have sex. The only reason this debate cannot be settled is that it is literally one of the only situations in life that has no fair outcome for both parties. 
This is so damn typical if the online negative crew. This awesome homeless facility is being built in my city and all of my friends that scream about helping homeless veterans are the same ones against this center. I live near the largest Navy base in the world, so we have plenty of homeless vets. It's very frustrating. Some people run their mouths and tell everybody else what to do, but don't want to put in any of the actual effort.
Abort. My eyes can't roll that far back into my head.
This is excellent news! Thank you.
You know what is making me feel unsafe? People throwing around the words "white supremacist" and "nazi" about a free market group I would proudly be a member of. The shit is getting real thick out there and it is borderline scary.
Agreed. My local newspaper only allows FB comments, but I can't have my boss or someone that could potentially ruin my life and career seeing those comments.
Perhaps this is at their own home and not at the store.
I relate to this so hard. I came home from work one day and logged onto my computer and started cussing something fierce. I was going on about my property and how dare they, etc. The husband was like, "wtf is wrong with you?" I was like, "these mother fuckers just updated my OS to Windows 10. Ahhhhhhhhhhh."
Jon Snow in 20 years.

30 years ago Republicans welcomed undocumented workers and Democrats were the ones that hated them. It was sometime after 911 that the parties flipped positions. Watch Bush and Regan debate on this very topic in the early 80s: https://youtu.be/Ixi9_cciy8w
That's not mildly a penis. That IS a penis.
This is like my house, but with two dogs.
Also depends on how many people you've screwed and how many of those videos are on youporn.
They don't want people to see them taking selfies of themselves in their vehicles. There is typically good lighting inside a car. Lots of light, but not direct. So, people take pictures there. I think men don't want to be associated as doing "girl-like" things and therefore hold the phone down low so no one can see. This is my theory.
Snowden, yes. Manning, no.
At one time I worked full-time and went to school full-time. Weird.

I ALWAYS read the article and then I go to the comments for a little bit of history, backstory, other facts and generally good points and conversation.
Yeah, let's instead throw around words like "anarchist."
A font meme to attract doctors who don't give a shit about fonts. Have you seen their handwriting? This is REALLY bad design.
News comments on the actual news story generally read like they were written by illiterate hillbillies. 
Thus is awesome.
The thing I do LOVE about the Daily Mail is that they never assume you know anything about the story before you read an article and they provide all the back story and lots of photos, etc. I know that they can be unreliable, but I do think that reliable news organizations could take some notes from DM. 
It was harassment the minute she kept sending messages after being blocked.

Hey, at least you didn't hang clothes from the water sprinklers only to set them off and send rust colored water all over your entire floor.
No, but they teach science.
This is what I do with my dogs and it has worked tremendously. It was a recommendation in a book I picked up after bringing home our second dog entitled Feeling Outnumbered? by Karen B. London, Ph.D. and Patricia B. McConnell, Ph.D.
Got it!
Shit..if you join some kind of softball team or something where you can easily talk to the same people on a regular basis there's no reason you won't make friends. Me personally, if I was in a town and didn't know anybody I would just go to a slow bar or somewhere people aren't in a hurry or on there way to something (you know like walking to work) pick out some cool looking people and just walk up or buy a pitcher and be like I'm blank from blank and I literally know zero people in this town and would like to audition to be in your friend circle. What are we doing next weekend? They'll probably find it funny and if you're confident and positive they probably accept you
Flat earth and lizard people
You mean those girls on tinder don't really think I'm cute and want me to text them and check out there pics on a sketchy porn website I've never heard of?(Which isn't many)\n\nBut ok that is useful. I'd ask you what wtf RES is but I feel like every answer would contain another term I don't understand and it would go on for infinity hahaha thanks for the help though.
So what I'm getting from you and a lot of others commenting Islam is a violent, intolerant religion and it's not just the culture. Not putting words in your mouth but am I correct?
Well one that's a lot of "I think" and "it seems like"\n\nSecond, dude there are 350 million of us spread across a HUGE piece of land and everyone comes from somewhere else. I love when people try to sum up what Americans think or do or eat or believe. Have you seen our news? Grab any two people of the street and they most likely are barely the same thing lol
What is this? What's happening? I don't completely know how to reddit yet I'm new
You said better man thank you haha
I knowwww I fucked up
Hey look at that Zug Island that's it my dad used to ski in the river and he said it was disgusting, pretty clean now though. \n\nA couple things though,\n\n1. I can't understand how people can possibly think that terraforming an entire planet, and moving earths population (obviously I don't think they actually want to bring us peasants lol) is easier than "terraforming" this planet lol it's already livable, mars ain't. It would be infinitely more difficult.\n\n2. Oil is subsidized which baffles me. From what I understand the get billions from the federal government. Plus with solar comes our independence. We don't have to worry about OPEC or no one not even power companies when a tornado rips through a neighborhood surrounding neighborhoods still have the lights on. I find it crazy people oppose this kind of self reliance. (Obviously we agree on this I'm just ranting lol)
Oh duh lmfao nm\n\nWe've been off the drunk topic so long I forgot hahaha
I don't understand why you can not accept such a simple fact: Americans speak more often about psychopaths than Europeans. Without a doubt, it is a cultural phenomenon!\n\nMy hypotheses (factors that can explain it):\n\n1. American society is more individualistic. Family networks are not as important as in other countries of more collectivist cultures.\n\n2. There is more culture of violence and insolidarity in the United States than in Europe (for exemple guns).\n\n3. In the movies it is a subject that attracts a lot of public and is exploited commercially.\n\n4. Diagnostics of psychopathy are exaggerated. In many cases it would be better to speak of cultural influence, not of psychopathy. In the United States it seems fashionable to blame everything on psychopaths ... and exclude American culture!\n\nOne, two, three, four blanket claims. No evidence, just statements\n\n\nThose who criticize me are influenced by cultural prejudices  and do not accept the vision of an observer of another culture. That's not a very scientific attitude...Culture exerts a lot of influence ... not everything is psychology or biology. It's not an issue of patriotism...I speak of science!\n\nI don't accept your statements not because I'm American, I don't accept your statements because you don't back them up with evidence and you can't apply a statement like that to the entire country. \n\nYour entire argument for why your statements are true is because you are from Denmark and I am from the United States.\n\nUsing your dumb logic anything that you say about Europe can't be true because you are from Europe and your pride for Europe gets in the way you understanding Europe.\n\nHave a great day....
[](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=p9afj1khMaQ) \n\nHahaha no but I've seen the one haha\n\nIt's this one I literally bust out snorting laughing no matter how many times I see this I can't help it\n\nI found out later somehow he was law enforcement.
Well see that is within my control so I'm not as concerned and believe me I'm careful lol. I usually remove the holster to re holster since it's just a clip.\n\nThe thing that blocks the firing pin failing isn't within my control

A petition? People are so dumb. They should teach a lesson in high school or something. \n\nCall it "Context and Intention: The three step program on how to not look like an asshat" \n\n1. Before you get mad at something wait one full week.\n\n2. Consider the circumstances that form the setting for an event, statement, or idea, and in terms of which it can be fully understood and assessed.\n\n3. Consider the intention of the person, company, group etc.'s actions or words.\n\nAnd if comes out of a comedians mouth please fuck of. It's not illegal. If you don't like it let them hang themselves with his or hers own speech. This is much more effective than trying to silence them. Example: Cosmo Kramer.
It seemed strange that you were only bringing up government directed "solutions". If I've misinterpreted and you're seeking counter arguments against government involvement from libertarians who famously eschew government involvement, then please accept my apology.\n\nME: No worries and best response yet!\nI believe in government staying completely out of our lives except to protect rights (including property rights) it's not that I think running out of resources and concentrated wealth are related they have just always been the two things that worried me about not have a strong government stepping in on.\n\nBut to see why government involvement is, at best, a bad idea, look at the historic examples of government controlling limited resources in high demand. I'm guessing you're probably not old enough to remember the gas lines in the 70s - but there was no gas. None. That's what happens when you insulate people from the economic cost for resource allocation. Not surprisingly, it's the economic point of failure for socialism (see "economic calculation problem").\n\nME: Great point not much else to say. This is why I like solar so much though and don't get why people cling to gas. It's not just environmental. It make us less dependent on others so it can't be dangled over our heads.\n\nI'm REALLY not following how you think the NAP and wealth concentration are related. I think to claim the free market is responsible for the wealth concentration disparity that's been rising since the 70s, I'm going to need you to explain the correlation between increasing government involvement in the economy and widening wealth concentration disparity amd vice versa. \n\nME: Again not related just my two worries about small government. \nThis is true. Like the government is a gun in the room and the fist person to buy out politicians gets what they want right?\n\nYour third paragraph sounds almost like a call to arms among the candle makers in the late 1800s.  Seriously, take a deep breath.\n\nME: I wasn't freaking out lol but can you see how it's different when the new technology is a better human body with a better, smarter consciousness? Like replacing lawyers, doctors, surgeons? And could continue technological progress without any human input, work on itself, wrote its own code and so on. My hope is a new industry pops up it's just I can't see how an AI with robot body couldn't handle any new industry that arises. Do I make sense or am I rambling? Lol\n\nNow, if you think the world is heading towards a situation where you won't be able to provide someone else with value, then perhaps you make value choices now to make sure you're not dependent on others to sustain your livelihood. Maybe seek out a mate who views things similarly and teach your kids to be self sufficient.\n\nME: Yea I'm 24 so my lifetime maybe not so much but I mean obviously I want my kids to do well. It's easier to be self sufficient with a 3D printer to I guess haha\n\nI'm a programmer and I know that the kind of automate-all-the-jobs scenario you're worrying about will never be here in my lifetime - and I'm fairly confident not in my grandkids' lifetimes either. So my time, energy, and money are going to be spent in much different ways.\n\nME: Fucking thank god that's great to hear from a programmer who understands this shit.\n\nMaybe I'll be wrong and be ass out in 10 years. What can I do then? Well, I can adapt and try to find other ways to provide value to others, or I can try to become self-sufficient myself, or I can beg, or I can die. My choices will determine my success or failure.\n\nME: Yea no one knows but when I'm sitting tower my brain is just running all day thinking about this stuff\n\nYou're right that people have been freaking out about stuff like for a long time...over 200 years since the luddites smashed the machines. And yet technology hasn't destroyed the labor market. It's continuously made things cheaper for everyone.\n\nME: Again it's that threshold technology that starts improving upon itself no maintenance required. Will the people who own it want to keep us around? Seems like at that point it would be easy to but then again weird stuff happens to you when have that level of wealth. I used to be able to feel it when I drove my old shitty S10 (first car) and I'd go to my friends house in a really nice neighborhood. People just look at you like they are going to catch a disease. Think of how you look at a chicken on a farm, if you had a machine that made eggs 10 times as fast you'd stop raising those smelly poopy chickens you never liked you just wanted the eggs. That machine also makes corn, beef, cloth, houses, cars, tables, and everything else imaginable so the chicken can't get a new job getting milked hahaha\nI think the .1 % looks at us like cockroaches and would get rid of us by now if they didn't still need us. I don't feel entitled to what they have but do think privately that's their attitude towards us.\n\nBut anyways definitely best response thank for inputing!!
Dude I can't stand this guy there's almost no blanket statement you can apply to US citizens except "they live inside US borders" \nDifferent states almost different countries culturally. And I want to get violent when he pulls this culture of violence shit when he's never been here before. How about the first and Second World Wars you twat. Or when you collapse a stadium and burn the city down when your soccer team loses or bull fighting real non violent. And he starts saying how we don't have family values or community we just drive to work and come home and clean our guns after we jerk off on them. Did you learn all this on the internet. Or the news? "It just seems like..." fuck you. Cunt. Ok. I'm done. phew. \n\nYou know what I'm saying?
For the role play lol
Annnnnd now I'm back to sitting completely still
See THIS is the kind of stuff I'm asking about. \n\nNot "make sure you don't accidentally pull the trigger" lol\n\nDouble like\n\nSee I'm not sure I've never fully disassembled my glock to check it before. I think I'm going to do that tomorrow.
No thank you for giving me a chance to fix it and not just take it down. I really appreciate it mate. I'll edit now.
Ohhhhh I thought it was trying to make you remove it
Thanks for the reply
Just roll with it I like it haha what do you do?
It's not a straw man I asked you a question and you have to check a fucking book a dead guy wrote to see if it ok to fuck child against her will.
I'm Ocean Rescue Lieutenant so I spend my days people watching. I honestly don't have a lot of faith in general public. For real.\n\nBut see the federal government subsidizes fossil fuels. They get like billions a year. So they are already meddling making fossil fuels cheaper.\n\nBut I agree I think people are moving that way on there own. Musk is a genius and really speeding things up.
Ok I don't know where you live but I live in a small town on a barrier island. So if you're imagining me in a populated city im not. I'm not saying I'm just jogging past the zombies and getting up there. I could be at my house, load up everything in the truck, drive to the market, if they're outside lure them out with the truck(i mean honestly you could drive around the block until they collapse) you could use fireworks, you could have some else in another vehicle distracting while you get stuff on the roof, like there is a lot of ways to do it and it just depends on the situation. I'm not just like this the plan can't take into account 5000 zombies outside the store. Getting the stuff up there wouldn't even take that long. You could have someone in the back of the truck throw a box up there every time you go around the block. Once everything up you do a nice big circle, lead them all away, come back and get on the roof. Like these are all things I would work out as I'm doing drive by scoping it out.\n\nOnce you're on the roof with the stuff. You're good. They can't jump 20 ft. I'm not worried about shooting them once I'm up there, this strategy is to play the waiting game until the zombies starve or at least most of them. It's not going to be that comfortable but at least I can sleep without worry about being attached in the middle of the night.\n\nUm I know how good of a shot I am. And I know my capabilities with a fire arm. One of my favorite YouTube channels is Active Self Defense. If you haven't seen it check it out this guy basic breaks down gas station robberies and stuff like that from CCTV video, great channel. And I'm also an EMT so I understand how blood loss from gunshot wounds work.\n\nAnd if I'm going to be bold with you seem to over complicate simple things in people's plans. Like the whole plan is to get to a roof with enough supplies to last a couple months and that could be 50 lbs of rice and a hose hooked up to a well at a bare minimum. Like I'm obviously not going to crowd surf a horde of zombies to get downstairs if I want better food. If I could distract them or get them to move away and slip down I would or just suck it up on the roof. And the this "I don't know if you knew but guns make a lot of noise and light" thing. Really? Like we're just talking about zombie plans on the internet lol
Whaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaat\nHow many pots have you smoken?\n\n\nME: *Starts searching "finance"*\n\n*Finland conspiracy pops up.*\n\n"Wait...wait what? Over 7000 people subscribe to this?"\n\n*clicks*\n\n*First post claims Finland doesn't exist*\n\n"Well there is no fucking way I'm not going read this entire thing from start to finish."\n\nNow I'm here.\n
People throw around basic income but I honestly don't know. If I could try to find a solution it might be to check off things people need by list of importance. Air is free, running water is basically free in the United States and western countries(I think our city water comes to 8 cents a gallon although I'm on a well) we sometime take running water for granted when at one time it was much harder to get to drink let alone have it shoot out of pipes in most rooms in your house. I believe soon food production will be completely autonomous. 40% or so worked on farms in the US in 1950 and I believe it's 1% today. Obviously growing food is more complicated than directing water but out technology is able to do more and more complex things everyday.\n\nBasically as it technology makes it easier to fill needs we keep checking items off the list. Air, water, food, shelter, medical care so on.\n\nDon't get me wrong the private sector got us to where we are now and I believe government slowed it down but I think we have to face the reality that before the century is over we will have humanoid robots that don't require sleep, food, vacation, sick leave, maternity leave, and frankly will probably do a better job faster with fewer mistakes. When they are humanoid fingers and all they can be retrofitted to trucks, brooms, keyboards. Anything a human can do physically. Not to mention they'll most likely be connected to a cloud so the efficiently they could operate at is unimaginable and I don't think any job is safe.\n\nThe other way I look at it is 40% percent farmed in 1950 but there was no technology industry and no one saw it coming. So there's hope we just can't predict future industries. Unfortunately I can't imagine once AI is up and running that there will be much left. Add in the fact it's happening so fast.\n\nI think people are scared to lose there jobs because it's the only way to get the things they need. One day they may not need to work a job to get the things they need just like we don't work to breathe.\n\nJust my two cents hope to get the discussion rollin' 
What's rule 1?
Move to where it is available.  If they aren't free to move, they probably are already in your communist utopia.
Nice! You both fucking got it!\n\nI think I'm going to add this to my living will because the blood loss from my giant cock would probably cause me to lose consciousness before I could raise the gun to my smaller head
Ahhhhhh hahahahaha got emmm
Boom! Got it without even trying! \nI looked up NSFW...not safe for work? I'll change it sorry new to reddit but I love it haha
I'm surprised he can run away so fast with his giant balls weighing him down
I mean if he's just staying the weekends not really. It's her place too. If you had bf you'd want to have him over. My roommates girl like lived their 5-6 nights a week and they both trashed the place. I just moved out lol
[Dire Straits-Money for Nothing](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=9MkIY_4k-QM) \n\nDoes video make me win lol sarcasm(;\n\nYou just can't argue with that intro it's impossible! Haha
Anal. Like if you're a dude banging a girl. I promise you won't get poop in you dick and it will make you feel way bigger.
I wish she was a bitch lol I want to hate her but she is the nicest girl but I think she sent the snap because she was drunk and wants to hook up with me again and is trying to fuck with my head...so I guess that makes her a bitch
EVERYTHING. Bro....You're probably going to bang one of the things before you die
Do you think if people weren't held back they wouldn't continue to use up resources as fast as possible to turn a profit. I don't just mean big bad evil corporations lol like the poorest farmers cutting down rain forests in South America they are literally just doing what they can to feed their kids but at the same time destroying the rain forest. I guess my point being don't we need a government to act like bumpers at bowling ally when we start going down a destructive path?
Yea that kind of sounds made up
Um in this specific case I don't see it this way. It would seem like that because this is the way it's been so long that movie stars and music artists should make an obscene amount of money as compensation for there work. I just don't see it that way. I understand that people are willing to pay and they used to so why wouldn't they sell for that much? But I they don't go under they still do EXTREMELY well. And they perform live shows. An artist writes a song, records it in a recording studio, puts it on iTunes, then makes millions. I just don't see how they're uncompensated. I see the internet as a great opportunity for music artist because record companies royally fuck over artists. They create these mega super stars and force it down our throats. Music streaming allows no name bands to rise to the top based on talent since they are all equally available and with audio equipment these day you can do it from your basement and throw it on Spotify(even though they fuck over artist as well but at least they get exposure). \n\nThis is a really specific case that I'm not so sure about. I think ideally bit coin micro payments would solve the problem, pay a tenth of a penny or whatever to listen to a song once. It's all legal and the artist is compensated. You pay a dollar to "own" a song? You don't own it, the record company does.
It was no problem for me
Hey I get down like that I just have to work on my accent lol
Yea as much as I try to understand how UBI would work I keep thinking like you said it would inflate prices. \n\nBoth even if you don't believe in climate change or anything like that there's no arguing pollution. My parents grew up in Windsor and back in the 70's there was an island in the Detroit river that they would literally dump chemicals on and the air pollution was terrible and would blow across the border. The cancer rates in Windsor are insane. It's just more profitable to dump it unless someone tells you no.\n\nPeak oil too. It come out of the ground, the earth is yay big, it's just a matter of time.\n\n
Thanks for the reply
It's definitely true this makes a huge impact how you come across to most people but I hate every bit of it lol. Obviously you want to communicate clear and concise but other than that I don't judge people on that just on the content of what they are saying. Just speak in a way that most easily conveys your message. No word salads.\n\nI never understood and never will why people like that "politician" way of speaking, I guess you would call it? \n\nThat and the way people dress. Obviously be clean and well groomed but the idea that the more uncomfortable your clothing is the more professional you are is retarded. How does a t shirt, shorts, and sneakers not suffice for a job interview or reflect badly on a businesses image? It's just not relevant.\n\nBut hey I rented a tux for my buddy's wedding a few months ago and I looked damn good(;
Never said I had an answer. Why I started this was to see what other people's ideas were. Also I don't think UBI would work but I haven't looked into it much. And asking if I myself would pay it is a pretty dumb question. Of course I couldn't. I think the problems of unemployment and a lack of resources is coming and wanted to hear if anyone had any creative ideas.
I read this last comment in Laurence Fishburne's voice lol I'll check it out
Of course but I would recommend not doing it to people at their job. Somewhere and sometime they have time to talk in a relaxed setting. Confidence is key. People like confident, positive, funny people. If you come across like that suddenly THEY will want to be YOUR friend. Talk to them like you've known them your whole life. Good luck dude.
No dude you're wrong you're observing social media and pop culture. I live here. The town I live is in is extremely social and help each other out. And they're is always groups raising money for community for one cause or the other.\n\nOwning a gun does not make you violent. Everybody I know owns a gun and I assure you we are not running around killing each other over here. In the United States places with a high concentration of gun owners/concealed carry holders have less violent crime. Period. As to if there's more violence here than Europe I don't know. But to say it's a culture of violence is ridiculous. Come visit sometime.\n\nMovies are movies lmao. We also watch Shrek and The Notebook.\n\n\nAnd you continue to make these blanket statements about by far the most diverse country in the world with 350 million people based on what "it seems like". I'm not affected by cultural prejudices, I live here and I know at least the people in my state and many others from traveling. You live in Denmark and watch the news. The news coming out of the United States in the last few years is so misleading to what the actual people are like here. All you see are the worst side of them.
Annnnnd now I can move. Thank you sir. But if my balls get shot off I'm coming for yours. 
Good response thank you
Fuck you that's not funny.\n\nBut you know what is?\n\nWhat is the first thing you should do in the event of an accidental discharge on your dick?
....fuck
I'm going to say this a third time. I don't think UBI would work it's just something I heard about don't really know everything about it, I might research it more\nI understand what libertarianism is. Minimum government interference in the lives of the citizens. That's exactly why I came to this subreddit to see what you guys think are some solutions to technological innovation and environmental damage/Resource management. Other than these two things I want the government out of my life just much as you but they are important things and I'm not sure if just letting things run it's coarse are going to solve that. \n\nAs a kind of example for the resource environmental side. If you were on an island and somebody was just chopping down all the cocoanut trees because he wanted to make a big tree house and shitting in your only fresh water supply splashing water around keep his ass clean(basically living the good life unsustainably) are you going to say "just live and let live" while cuts down the last one and the water is tainted? Probably not because then there's no more cocoanuts and you're going to be thirsty. \n\nDo kind of see what I'm saying? I don't have the answers and I wish we could just keep on doing what we're doing. But it seems like we can't.
He's probably following your updates on Reddit lol
THANK YOU
You are such a moron to think you need an old book and a bunch of links to tell you if it's ok fuck children.
Oh you fucker you:)
I hate when people say poo. I'm imagining a 6 year old telling this story lol
Lol because I'm a lifeguard so my free time is at work not at home. Also I didn't realize how much more you can do on the desktop. \n\nAlthough I destroyed my ACL and had surgery today so that leaves me plenty of free time at home to explore the benefits of the desktop version lmao
Do you think men should be able to marry and have sex with a six year old girl?
If we're talking about 28 days later "zombies," then yes, I would be dead. There is absolutely no practical way to fight them other than being in the right place at the \nright time. That's my entire point. \n\n\n^YOU SAY THEY'RE IS NO PRACTICAL WAY TO FIGHT THEM THAN JUST BEING IN A BUNKER WHEN IT HAPPENS SO WHY ARE WE DISCUSSING THIS. THIS IS A FANTASY WHAT IF TIME WASTER AND YOUR LETTING ME CONTINUE TO EXPLAIN STUFF WHEN THIS IS YOUR IS YOUR CONCLUSION^\n\nIGNORE ALL CAPS JUST TO HIGHLIGHT MY PART\n\n\nBut perhaps I'm not illustrating my point very well. \n\nHere is a video of a very small group of people, most of whom are actively trying to get out of his way. \n\nhttps://youtu.be/nrSLo5G0vtc\n\nNow imagine it with rush hour traffic and a lot more people. I think simply driving through is not a realistic expectation. Maybe you could get through a couple, but I think it's only a matter of time before you get stuck. \n\n\n>Bro your honestly just being stupid at this point the wells are spickets and garden hoses lmao. You turn it on and throw those hose on the roof. Like this is what I'm talking about you making everything complicated. I'm not doing that without distracting the zombies or whatever. Same way I got in there.\n\n"Or whatever." Please elaborate. How would you distract them exactly, and for how long? \n\n\nWhat would you do if you encountered a snag, for example what if the hose you picked wasn't long enough to reach the roof, or the house didn't have a well? You would have to change plans on the fly, with infected running around. \n\n^THIS PART RIGHT HERE IS WHY THIS ISN'T FUN ANYMORE^\n\n"WHAT IF I ENCOUNTERED A SNAG?"\nWHAT IF I STUBBED MY TOE? \nWHAT IF A HAWK PICKED UP A ZOMBIE AND DROPPED IT ON MY HEAD?\n\nA SNAG? DO YOU SEE WHAT IM SAYING?\n\nWHAT IF I THE HOSE I PICKED WASN'T LONG ENOUGH? GEE I GUESS ID CHECK THAT BEFORE I GET DOWN TO GO SCREW IT IN.\n\nYOU ARE POINTING OUT LITERALLY ANYTHING THAT COULD GO WRONG\n\nILL MAKE UP SOME MORE\n\nWHAT IF I HAD STROKE ON MY DRIVE HOME\n\nWHAT IF AN ALLIGATOR JUMPED OUT FROM UNDER MY TRUCK\n\nI JUST FEEL LIKE A COP WOULD UNDERSTAND THAT THERE WOULD BE SOME THINKING ON YOUR FEET WITH LITTLE DETAILS IN A SITUATION LIKE THIS AND THAT A GOOD PLAN IS BETTER THAN A PERFECT PLAN\n\nTHE ALL CAPS IS JUST TO HIGHLIGHT WHAT IM SAYING NOT YELLING\n\n\nIn the movies they barely have time to stop and change a tire, and those streets are unrealistically bare. It would be more like trying to set up a garden hose in the middle of this:\n\nhttps://youtu.be/M4i5sxU0pG4\n\nThat's a relatively small crowd. Any town would have a lot more people, a lot more cars, and a lot more chaos. \n\n\n\n\n \nNow, maybe this is just my limited imagination, but I can't imagine what you could come up with on the fly that would buy you twenty seconds, let alone 20 minutes, in the middle of that. And this thing spreads so rapidly that this would be everywhere if it made it to your island. \n\n^AND THIS PART^\n\nI HAVE A HOCKEY BAG\n\nI HAVE A PANTRY\n\n*SWEEPS ARM ACROSS PANTRY SHELVES\n\nI HAVE A HOCKEY BAG FULL OF FOOD\n\n*DOES SAME THING WITH AMMO\n\nLETS GET THE FUCK OUT OF HERE\n\nTHE ALL CAPS IS JUST TO HIGHLIGHT WHAT IM SAYING NOT YELLING\n\nIM NOT UPSET AND I ENJOY DISCUSSION AND DEBATE  BUT IF YOU BELIEVE NEITHER OF US WILL MAKE TEN FEET WITHOUT DYING THAN WHAT IS THE DISCUSSION FOR? DOES THAT MAKE SENSE? AGIAN IGNORE ALL CAPS IMAGINE VOICE AS FRIENDLY WITH A LITTLE MOCKING MIXED IN \n\n\n\n\nI don't think any survival plan would help you in that case.\n\n\n\n\n>Wow dude you are really turning me off to this sub\n\nIf that's be case I sincerely apologize. That is not my intent. I enjoy the discussion and debate. If you're not, then we don't have to continue. My intent was not to put you down, and I'm sorry if it came off like that. It's hard to convey tone in a format like this, but I meant for this to be a friendly discussion. 
If you're a girl that makes things easier 
You're unbelievable. You don't listen to what I'm saying. If I didn't know better I'd think you were doing this just to get a rise. It's not a national thing. The country is so big culture is different everywhere you go. Colorados not like Boston, Californias not like Texas. Floridas not like Michigan. That's why I'm saying you can't group American's together and say they are "blank". Peaceful or violent, individualistic or communal, you can't make blankets statement on a country that diverse. \n\nGo back to your comment where you number off your hypothesis. You make four blanket claims that that you still have not given any evidence on.\n\nAnd you finish it off by saying if you disagree with me you are just showing your unconscious nationalism. That's doesn't make your claims true. That's not an argument.\n\nThat is not scientific it's the farthest thing from it. Nothing based on evidence. Not taking into account how vastly different the people are in different parts of the country. Then when you're called out on your bullshit you resort to finding out how old I am and saying that's the reason I don't agree with you. I don't agree with you because you've made ridiculous claims and refuse to back them up with evidence. \n\nAnd then you tell me I know nothing about life and my attitude is shameful lmao. That entire comment was attacking me and you didn't defend your points at all. Dude you're a complete joke. What does Freud say about inflated egos?
I promise you won't regret it\n\n[](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=S3Ucz3aluoA) 
An even easier way to say it is "You're pulling shit out of your ass"  lol
Wait what that wasn't spam his comment was helpful
Honestly I'm not sure why I put that in there lol it has nothing to do with it I'm editing it out
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=S3Ucz3aluoA
He went to r/Latviajokes in search of potatoes
I'm an officer so I spend a lot of time up past the dunes in the station because it's a central location and respond to emergency calls from the seasonal guards that sit tower when they get into a serious situation on my side by side which has better medical equipment and rescue tools and officers with better training(who are EMTs not first responders like seasonal guards) that we can't afford to give each tower. I'm not on my phone while on the beach. Not drunk either.
From what you're saying Americans can't study they're culture at all? Because of a bias? Then I'm sorry sir you can't possibly know how Europeans feel about psychopaths, as you are a European yourself your bias is like Ray Bands preventing you from seeing the light of truth! Europeans are obsessed with psychopaths! But remember, anything you say back is affected by your fondness of Europe!
It's wonderful that you do that. I believe your opinion weighs more than gold. I'm more libertarian and share stances on both sides. It refreshing to know you look at everything before forming your opinion. Even if we don't agree.:)
Me too, well I wish you the best of luck miss 3rd wheel and remember if all else fails get your own boyfriend and have loud sex the whole neighborhood can hear
My mom's dead
I wonder how many times the fire department responds here
Yea I do know this stuff? The question was has anyone heard of an instance a glock discharged without the trigger being pulled\n\nNot what are firearm safety basics lol
Hahahaha
Ohhhh ok lol when I asked I wanted him to come up with a smart ass answer like friends don't let friends blank lol I apologize\n\nBut yea if you carry appendix you just have to break rule 2 no way around it. But that's not to say people don't break it carrying it in other ways. YouTube is proof of that haha have you seen the one where the guy draws either 5 o clock inside the waistband or 3 o clock outside the waistband (can't remember) and he shoots himself in the leg. And he was law enforcement lol. I think it was on Tosh.0\n\nI guess the stakes are higher with appendix though lol
I think appendix is the best way. You can guard you gun, shortest distance to draw and get on target, draw from a seated position, readjust during the day easier, not print bending over the list goes on and on. \n\nI just wanted to know if anyone's came across anything about a glock firing without the trigger pulled. Accidentally pulling the trigger doesn't concern me because that in my control.\n\nPlus this post is only half serious as you can see lol
You're a moron if you believe that everything you are saying about me doesn't apply to you. This is the problem I have with shrink type thinkers. You seem to think you're not affected by any of this psychological stuff like you are the only purely objective observer. You don't have ANY evidence to back up your claims. You are going of your gut feeling based on what you see on tv and on the internet which is literally EXACTLY what you claim skews my view. Of course media skews perceptions. The only way to be objective is to have first hand experience and BE in the place your talking about. I took psychology in high school and I'm not into it. An argument stands on its own merits based on evidence not the person making the claim. Also, I'm 24, and the same thing applies, an argument stands on its own merits based on evidence not the age of the person making the claim.
......what are we gonna do with the camel?
I understand perfectly.\n\nYou are criticizing American culture in your 4 numbered "hypothesis" which came completely out of your ass not backed up by ANY FACTS. \n\nSee their you go again "American seem" "This does not happen in Europe!" Really? At all? You're telling me you don't talk about psychopaths in Europe. And you speak for an entire continent?\n\n"You are probably being manipulated by the media to attract audiences"\nThis is what I can't stand about you shrinky cunts. When you can't defend yourself with facts you patronize your opponent saying they can't understand because they have a bias. Its the same under handed move people use when they say white people cant have an opinion on racial issues. You don't apply this shit to yourself. EVERY OBSERVATION YOU HAVE OF THE UNITED STATES IS THROUGH THE LENSE OF YOUR MEDIA. Did you ever think maybe the media you're watching in your own country is slanted to show Americans in a bad light. I've seen it and how they portray us. I half don't even blame you for having this opinion. I've made myself as clear as I can and this is getting us no where so I'm done. But I looked at your profile and you have like 12 karma points in like 3 years so maybe that says something about your cunty undermining attitude.\n\n\n
The main difference is were not on the verge of inventing a calculator, a bulldozer, or an airplane that aids in doing another job.\n\nWe're on the verge of inventing a humanoid robot that can do anything to human can do physically or mentally. Wayyy better than any human. Where the AI  will create more efficiency versions of itself and its body.\n\nI mean just try to imagine. They will smarter and stronger and capable of doing anything humans can do and more. What could you bring to the table in a world like that other than a handout?
Sweat it out.
Thanks Reddit and snapchat are the only socials I'm on and I just recently redownloaded snapchat she snuck in their sneaky whore. I still get random texts from her though like asking me how much rent I payed at my old place after not talking to her for months. So I tell her and she's like ok. And I'm like are you planning on renting their? And she's like no. Sooo you're just wondering how much I paid? And she's like yea. Just this super obvious booty call stuff right as I'm getting over it she knows if she just pops up on my radar I cave sometimes and then regret it for 2 months. Worth it? Maybe she's a freak and I still love her.\n\nWhat's up with this red pill thing what's that?
That is an awesome video. I never knew primers came in different levels of softness. And yea definitely unlikely both happening at the same time but the block could get stuck months before the day that the firing pin slips you know what I mean?\n\nI think what I'm going to do is periodically check the blocking mechanism to make sure it's functioning, maybe after I go shooting while I'm cleaning to ease my own paranoia because dead serious I would honestly consider blasting myself if I ever shot my dick off lol\n\nJust out of curiosity whatcha packin and how do you carry it?
When he's out just lock the door and don't let him in. He should figure it out by sundown.
Dude...there is no guise, there is no trick. I agree with like 90% of what you just said. I try to play devils advocate constantly to make sure I'm on the right side of things. \n\nAgain I don't defend UBI I don't know that much about it. My first comment I said some people throw around UBI and then I went into my own idea. Which is basically like city water or the postal service or the library, except maybe their will be a time when they do it with food and other things. Like I said before I DONT HAVE ANY ANSWERS AND DONT CLAIM TO. I literally just made that stuff up as I was typing to get the conversation going. I basically agree with everything you point out in the comment above but what freaks me out with the non aggression principle is how fast ownership of everything is moving to a couple hundred people. I mean seriously it's scary go check out a timeline of wealth distribution since like 1900\n\nThey need us right now. There are complex moves are our bodies can make and cognitive stuff that machines just are not capable of. I am extremely confident that they will soon though. So you know 500,000, a million, 2 million people whatever pick a number of people that will "own" everything. Now they don't need us. They own the resources and have the means to turn the resources into the shit they need without help from us. So then we have nothing to offer to trade for the stuff we need what's going to happen to us?\n\nThis has happened all through history but I get the feeling it's happening to fast. Like where entire industries are taken over by machines while your kids in collage to work in that industry lol
Wow dude you are really turning me off to this sub\n\nAs for getting home I don't understand how you think it will be hard? I drive my truck home. Simple as that. The things aren't super human. Drive around them or hit them with the brush guard. As for the windows go to a junk yard and try to break a car window with your hand lol. And they are not disabling my vehicle they are flesh and bone  I'm not hitting them going 50 miles an hours like hitting a deer.\n\nI don't care how long it takes me to pack up. I'll get there when I get there. All I need is food water guns and ammo I'm not sure what you're bringing? I don't especially even need the food because it's there but if you got to know I could be be in and out of my house with the stuff in 20 minutes tops lol\n\nI never said I'd be tossing a 50 lb bag of rice to the second story. I keep them in smaller bottles. Also never said the truck would be moving I'm not going stop by the side of the shop until I herded them all out of the way.\n\nHow is calmly driving my truck away from the group out of a comedy? You get them following you far enough away and drive back to the shop faster than they are running\n\nOnce again I don't care about shooting zombies on the roof...just wait for them to die of thirst or starve.\n\nBro your honestly just being stupid at this point the wells are spickets and garden hoses lmao. You turn it on and throw those hose on the roof. Like this is what I'm talking about you making everything complicated. I'm not doing that without distracting the zombies or whatever. Same way I got in there.\n\nAnd like going back to getting home safely. If you're in your cruiser I guess you're dead instantly to right? I mean there's a good chance you'll be working. Let's hear your plan.
I'm familiar with the Luddite fallacy and completely agree the problem I see is this technology is different. You ever see those videos of robots they keep kicking over (which freaks me the fuck out don't piss them off) those things are going be indistinguishable from people "soon" 10 years, 30 years, 100 years. Either way it's coming. Partnered with AI which will be smarter than us, communicate with each other. We won't have anything to contribute. It's not a cotton gin or bulldozer. It's basically a human, a better human worker that we can't compete with physically or mentally or creatively which doesn't really fit in with the Luddite fallacy. Does that make sense?
You can't beat the character of a hockey player. I would be a completely different person without the sport. \n\nYamother69, did you just compliment me?\n\nWhy yes I did, yamother69, you are an upstanding gentleman and a scholar and my best friend.\n\nNo, no, no, not me! You, yamother69! You make the sun shine on a cloudy day and make the ladies wet with your smile.\n\n\nWtf is wrong with me I'm gonna go jerk off to myself.\n\n
Yes I see what your saying. That actually kind of sucks too lol. The fact that automation wouldn't completely take over because we need to make sure everybody has something to do to buy stuff they need.\n\nIt we saw the day a intelligent humanoid robots became affordable that almost everyone could get one. Or if everyone had a 3D printer(assuming 3D printers could use a wide variety of materials by then) all you need are the plans. Make any product you want!  No over producing. Cost to make products would just be the designer or engineer and a pc. They are getting better and better at testing prototypes entirely on the computer.\n\nIt's like if you steal a CD, the record company that created that CD packaged it shipped it and when you take it the person you stole it from they can't listen to it anymore\n\nSteal an MP3 it's just a copy. It's just information. The person you stole it from still has it. There is two of them now.\n\nOnce they have the plans for the robot and start pumping them out and everyone had one you could send it to work for you. I really think at that point you could end work. Spend your time doing things your interested in.\n\nIt seems like science fiction I could think about this stuff all day.\n\nBut yea I was just ranting after the first paragraph. I agree when you say it wouldn't work now for sure.\n
I edited it out I was thinking of going in a different direction and didn't read over it before I hit post lol
Probably more that won't comment or even if they do won't flash their colors.
Damn, I'm in suburban Philly myself.   Wish mine survived.  
I didn't think that was what you meant but some people do think that lol about the we'll just ditch earth and go to mars thing\n\nI just think solar stored in hydrogen seems like a good idea \n\nI saw a video of an off the grid survivalist guy. He had solar panels that power that thing, I don't know what it's called, to split water hydrogen and oxygen. He stored the hydrogen in old scuba tanks. Ran an old ford tweaked for hydrogen, a hydrogen generator for his cabin, and to heat the cabin he just had a little Bunsen burner in the middle of the room. No need for a chimney, no smoke, so no need to let all the heat escape. I'm talking a BIG cabin one little flame and he doesn't even run it all night. That dude answers to no one. That independence.
24, yea it's been a good couple of months and then she pullls that trying to make me jealous. Honestly it's probably better because it just makes me not like her as much.
Move on
I dislike the logical hypocrisy of it.  In general, I am in favor of your list, I just don't think liberalism really is.\n\n> Freedom of speech  \n\nLike shutting down all people you disagree with.  Look at Milo in Berkely.  Many other conservative speakers have gotten shut down, usually without the rioting though.\n\n>freedom of religion\n\nYou just had a ruling against that by a liberal judge two days ago.  Look at the cases of Christian bakers/florists/court clerks etc.  They even tried to have a bunch of nuns provide birth control (fortunately freedom of religion prevailed here, but the attempt was made)\n\n>Free markets\n\nWith all the regulations democrats consistently propose I think it is harder to make an argument that they are in favor of free markets than it is to point to examples where they are not.  \n\n>Civil rights\n\nYou can thank Republicans for that.  It wasn't Republicans who killed the Civil Rights Act of 1957.  It wasn't Democrats who freed the slaves.  It wasn't liberals who passed Women's Sufferage.  \n\n>democratic societies\n\nI prefer being a constitutional republic because it helps prevent mob rule\n\n>Secular governments\n\nI only care about our government.  While I appreciate that we don't endorse one particular sect over another, I am in favor of the government generally reflecting Judeo-Christian values. \n\n>Gender Equality\n\nAgain Women's suffrage.  Also, how can you say you support gender equality and also be a huge supporter of Muslim nations  \n>international cooperation\n\nI am in favor of getting along with other nations, just not at the expense of American citizens.  We are the most powerful nation in the world and in most of our dealings with the international community, we get the short end of the stick.  \n\nSo while I agree with many of the things you say you desire, I disagree with the means of achieving those outcomes.  
You still have a local bank?  Dodd-Frank killed ours long ago, its been 4 different banks since then, the orginal was there for over 20 years.
So nice to see Jenkins finding his stroke.
Re-reads change everything.  Every book deserves its own love. 
That's why Trump beat Hillary. 
I'm ok with it.  They don't have the power to stop Trump's picks because Harry Reid switched it to the nuclear option.  All she is doing is delaying the inevitable and preventing people from getting to work and doing their job of running the country.  While probably having the same result (because of the bias of the 9th circuit), last night's appeal would have had better legal arguments had Trump had is attorneys in place.  And Sessions definitely isn't racist, he practically abolished the klan in Alabama or Arkansas (I forget which).\n\nedit:  Plus she was in clear violation of Senate Rule 19, particularly "No Senator in debate shall, directly or indirectly, by any form of words impute to another Senator or to other Senators any conduct or motive unworthy or unbecoming a Senator."  \n\nedit 2:  Let's play who is the racist...  \nOption 1: A lawyer who broke up the KKK in the state of Alabama  \nOption 2: A lady who appropriated the race of an indigenous people for professional gain
While I don't necessarily believe it is solely that fault of the administration, there are plenty of areas where some degree of bipartisan support could be had.  It would be nice to see both sides work on something they can agree on.
Like getting rid of the Department of Education and returning that power to the states.  Yea, you actually are right.
No.  Not unless we have intel of something much much worse than 9/11.  Personally, after the Boston bombing, I think they went way overboard trying to catch them.  The entire city going on lock down was a huge overreach IMHO.
Goddam Canadiens and their goddam apologies.  
We drive on the right over here.
The only things that are a must for me when I am in Chicago are Ditka's and Weiner Circle. 
Equal opportunity from a governmental point of view.  Some people are always going to be born with advantages, but the government shouldn't be able to pick winners and losers.
I didn't make an assumption, I just said what the headline stated and clearly expressed that I didn't read the article and therefore couldn't validate its claims.  Plus OP already expressed that he did read the article and it was misleading because the savings were at a state level and not the federal level.  Not really sure why you had the need to comment other than to be a dick because I am a Trump supporter.
It wasn't his 10-year-old.  It was the son of his ex-fiance.
Definitely r/contagiouslaughter material.  
Not zero, but way less than we currently do.  This quote from Benny Franklin sums up my reasoning perfectly:  \n\n"I am for doing good to the poor, but...I think the best way of doing good to the poor, is not making them easy in poverty, but leading or driving them out of it. I observed...that the more public provisions were made for the poor, the less they provided for themselves, and of course became poorer. And, on the contrary, the less was done for them, the more they did for themselves, and became richer."
Fun fact: I peed off the mountain on the left. 
It is not his place to comment as President.  However, I understand that as a father he sees his daughter being treated wrongly and has the need to stick up for his daughter.  I also think it is a dumb move by Norstroms.  Again though, since he is President, he shouldn't have tweeted this.
Depends on the dog for which reward they like best
Because the claim of the headline was relevant to the topic at hand.  I fully acknowledged that I didn't read the article so I couldn't attest to its accuracy, but if it is something that OP was interested in that further reading existed out there.  OP in this case, had already read the article.  I just through it out there in addition to how I felt about the idea of raising taxes to pay for the wall.   I really didn't think if you look at my original comment that was so hard to understand.
Then if they can financially afford it while still being able to put the time in for the child, yea, its fine.
If they are able to provide and foster a caring/loving environment for the child, sure, why not.  As a conservative, regardless of my already expressed view, I am against government regulation whenever possible, therefore, I would be against the government passing laws to prevent your scenario even if I wasn't fine with your scenario to begin with.
What's his position on Eagles fans and Phillies fans?  How does he feel about Dallas?
Somalia the one place without a shortage.  Literally ever other place in the world has a greater shortage than Somalia. 
Only if the bakers don't have to make their cake. 
Was he from the industry or just from the community?  My impression, and I don't remember enough to back this up, was just that he was some Climate Alarmist and the intention of the act was to effectively kill the industry.  
I hate it when I go to cash in my change and somehow I have a bunch of your coins mixed in with mine because I didn't catch it when some cashier mixed it in.
Thank you so much
Man, Challenges (the arcade where Adam got a job) used to be the bee's knees.  
That doesn't mean their budgets aren't subjected to bloat. 
Charred and delicious. 
They were fine for two hundred years before Obama came into office.  As far as the communities having a voice, that's why those areas most affected voted for Trump.  Obama's executive order was killing those communities.  
Screw that.  I have waited my whole life to catch a foul ball/home run.  If I catch a ball, unless the kid is part of my group, I am keeping it.

You also have to look at where he started though.  Most Presidents get a honeymoon period, especially with the press, which Trump clearly did not get.
I mean I drive past one every now and then, never met anyone who has actually been to one
I define religious freedom as the government does not have the right to force you to do something that goes against religious beliefs.   It does get blurry though when you consider Shira Law.  
/r/AccidentalCamouflage 
> taken by force or coercion\n\nLike when people freely enter into contracts to exchange their labor for money?
It's about $130,000 a year.  Not a ton but if you are child free you could live comfortably.  
I've done that pee as well. 
Nope.  The whole reason why the market has been rallying and companies are hiring domestic or canceling plans to outsource is because of the belief that we are getting less taxes not more.   I read a headline to an article yesterday that said even if they went with the most expensive wall possible, that it would pay for itself within 10 years.   I didn't read the article so I don't know how they justify it though.  
States power along with school choice.  The two have to go hand in hand to get the optimal benefits.  If you don't want intelligent design being taught, you have the choice to go to a school where that is not being taught, problem solved.  And how the state rights argument was used one hundred and 50 years ago isn't relevant to the debate right here.  
They all moved down and infested Avalon.
What is the meme called and what does it represent?  Yeah, yeah, knowyourmeme, but I feel like it would be easier for someone just to tell me.  
Did I miss where the federal government banned horse in buggies in favor of the car?  The progress that has been made in terms of renewables is wonderful.  When they get to the point where they are more economically efficient than the alternatives is when I will fully embrace them in my daily life.  
That's just what they want you to think
> Then we can get them damn minorities out of our schools and make sure the homos can't get married! \n\nThis is literally on no one's agenda.  Trump actually stood up for gay rights when he extended Obama's executive order on the matter.  Having school choice and having states control their education systems will help minority communities in ways that haven't been seen since the civil rights movement.   Get out of here with all your hate.  
Interesting.  Like I said, I didn't read the article, just saw the headline.
At which point you tell them all that since the kid is a Philadelphia sports fan he should get used to being disappointed.

r/mutt also loves playing this game.  
Nice try, but you aren't going to be eating my eye balls anytime soon.

I'm jealous.  I used to love mine, I was even a shareholder went they offered stock to the community.  It literally was a community bank and then the regulations came and ended all of that.

Take it with a grain of salt.  Same way we handled it with every single President before him.
Well, one is outside, one is in Chestnut Hill.
Wow, that is a good memory.  
I think I need to look deeper into this issue.  I didn't realize it was about increasing subsidies to the coal industry, I thought it was removing regulations that hindered the industry.    As a general rule (although exceptions exist) I am against raising subsidies and in favor of fewer regulations.    I will have to look deeper into this issue and re-evaluate my opinions after. 
97%  I wouldn't say perfectly because of the phrase "source of the discontent" without bringing up how much many of his supporters gobbled it up.  If you go over to T-D I think many of them ejaculated in their pants.  This entire comment is pedantic, sorry about that.
Oh I agree.  My entire pedantic comment was about the difference between 97% and 100%
It's a tough balance.  Ben Franklin said it best with, "Those who would give up essential Liberty, to purchase a little temporary Safety, deserve neither Liberty nor Safety."   That being said, I don't want a plane to crash into my building that I am working in.  I don't know where that line gets drawn, fortunately, it is not my decision to make.

Because I am against stoning women to death even if their religion says that is the proper punishment.
> abuse of his executive power\n\nNo, because the only power he used was his soap box, he didn't use the strong arm of the law to attack them.  \n\n>  Does the fact that it is his family present a conflict of interest?\n\nNo, because the only reason why Ivanka was attacked was because of who her father is.  All he did was speak out, which he shouldn't have done, but it's not a gross overstep of governmental power.
I didn't believe J walking was a real thing here in America, but apparently in some places it actually gets enforced.   Not so here in Philly.

The pork ribs were falling off the bone and yea the beef ribs were charred but they were delicious. 
That's a good plan, I only brought it up because I saw a few comments over there of people who weren't as forward thinking as you.
Sounds even better with the subway acoustics.  I have missed trains listening to this man sing. 
If he really "boxed for years" he needs to go to a different gym.  His form is atrocious.  
Maybe it is because the post right above this one (on my front page) sent me to r/cocainegonewild but all I see is a limp dick.
That's what I thought.  Still want to know what the symptoms would look like though just in case.
It's not like I go there sober
That's what my dog does when he tells me he wants to go outside and I tell him to hold on while I finish this paragraph or whatever I am working on.
I like him.  He has a tough job and I think he is doing as good as anyone in his position could do.  Also, I am thankful that we don't have to listen to Josh "Not-so" Earnest anymore.
I thought it went awesomely.  Broke a lot of news and was highly entertaining.  
[Most overturned](http://www.nationalreview.com/bench-memos/373273/ninth-circuit-leading-pack-most-reversed-jonathan-keim)  court.  Look at their rulings and I let you decide for yourself which way their bias leans.
Reminds me of Ray Liotta in Field of Dreams when he is talking about how Ty Cobb wanted to play but they told him to stick it.
No, from a previous relationship.
For the stuff they actually agree on, even though I can't speak for other NN, I would assume they would be in favor of coming together and getting it done.  As for the "liberal tears" nonsense, I think that is just a (petty) reaction to how republicans have been treated the past 8 years.
Except that there was no legal basis in that ruling.  They didn't even quote the law that explicitly gives Trump the power to pass such an executive order. 
Eh, I feel like the show has run its course anyway. 
Cover the positives that Trump has done in addition to the negative that they currently cover.   For Obama, it would have been the opposite, if they also covered the negative in addition to the positive.  The one-sided hole they have dug themselves into doesn't seem to be going anywhere any time soon though.
You mean make them knock and use the door to come here legally?  The horror! 
Mexico has its fair share of shit holes too. Still better than Guatemala though. 
Yes, because you can work somewhere else.
That's not true, you can always work for yourself.   And what is your solution?  It's not like communism fixes the issues you have brought up here.

It doesn't really snow in Alabama, where the ladies were trying to find the candle shop.
Hey doc, student here: just curious which abnormalities you're seeing and what that could indicate to you.  Not for any purpose other than education
Politifact, lol.
Hey, I took that word out.  My response to you isn't that anyone should seek God or even change; it's only a message of acceptance for where she is.  I know you've been insulted by Christianity in the past and that there's a heightened sensitivity there.  I'm sorry for all the people that have acted like it will magically make pain go away; it doesn't.  When it rains, it rains on us all, no matter what faith you have.  I hope you do eventually let yourself be calm enough to read it and see that conversion isn't what I'm promoting here; I'm only promoting her knowing that she's loved.
Too much sodium in its diet.  Do they salt the roads where you live?\n\nOkay, all terrible jokes aside, are you checking it before driving that day?  Driving causes the molecules to bounce and it drives up pressure.

You could also get your CNA and work at a hospital that does tuition reimbursement.  Some of them will pay $5K-$10K a year of your tuition and you can do loans or pay outright for the rest.

Sure. That's why I said they should put a chain there to block it off.  I agree this wasn't properly marked; I was only pointing out a person's first thought being snow and how super common that isn't in Alabama.\n\nAlso, your personal attacks about my safety training are a bit dramatic and incorrect.
Not a doc, but that sounds more like Crohn's than UC. Did you get any sores in your mouth?   And weird question; did you get any fistulas or abscesses near your rectum or your perineum?  Don't have to answer, just take note.\n\nAlso, if you stopped eating highlighters, you'd probably feel better :-)

I'd make Legos grow out of the soles of their feet like cysts.  They'd be stepping on them all the time unless they lysed them every day.  I'd also have them grow between their thighs.
Yep.  Sure is.  It looks like most people can't afford the gravestones either.
Manage that with good sleep, exercise, vitamins, and a healthy diet and you should be good to go!  Way to go!!!
There was no sarcasm about the chain. Dead serious.  That's what they should do! Maybe a couple concrete bumper posts, too.  OSHA would have you paint the ledge as well and I even agree with that.  Barriers would be tough to move out of the way everyday though.\n\nNo one is saying you shouldn't protect people; I only tried to point out that snow isn't super likely in Alabama.  You still offended?
I would not advise CC credits as not all dental schools will accept them. You'll definitely need those classes.  I went back for an extra semester just to nab them (I came from a Physical Therapy background) and that wasn't too bad.  Don't get discouraged and stall; just make it happen! Good luck!
This sounds cool!

Don't over-divulge information that can make her feel inadequate or like there's someone better.  Protect her heart.  Tell her that she is really sweet, that this is really difficult, and that you had a fantastic time with her, but that it doesn't feel like the 100% right decision for right now

Goedemorgen!  Guy with crohn's here.  Honestly, just keep doing what you're doing.  If it puts a ton strain on you, tell her; she actually needs to know how to deal with this.  It is rough and it will put some strain on both of you, you just can't be her only source of making it better.  Is she seeing a doctor? She needs to do that.  That's step one to getting into remission.  She'll also need to go onto a very pure diet.  She should drop out alcohol for a while and get her sleep schedule dialed in.  Cut back on dairy and reduce the intake of rough fiber as that can rub inflamed areas in the GI tract and cause really painful gas.  One of the things that's really helped me immensely is to lift weights. Running (which I love) can cause irritation in the intestines, so I opt for resistance training.\n\nSorry you guys are going through this.  It's not an easy road.  Praying for you both!
Ages 10-30? I hope you don't mean that those are the ages of girls you date.

It's likely incomplete because it didn't refer to the scenario of the smooth muscles contracting out of sync. It only talked about pneumointerference and not synchronization issues.  The original description was more about using both hands to move the bead through the toothpaste tube.  The focus of the original comparison is actually the hands (or the esophageal SM in this case).  The description only slightly alluded to the possibility of the muscles being out of sync without actually stating it.
Amen to that!  It's not bad over here.  Honestly the news is making it out as sensational just so they can sell advertisement space (more views = more $)
Pretty sure Monaco has 100% access as does Sealand
I'm new to it too! I was diagnosed the same year you were (just 3 years ago) and now they're leaning more towards Crohn's with my diagnosis, but they're still not totally sure which IBD it is.  I'm so sorry you're going through this too.  I guess we can be battle buddies then? :-)\n\nSorry if I sounded rude at all.  I sometimes can come across as rather "matter of fact".\n\nAre you in remission at all?  How long have you been in remission and which meds do they have you on?  Just curious.  You don't have to answer as those are pretty personal questions.\n\nPraying for you to feel better!

Came to reddit to learn how to pick up chicks:  level unlocked.
Huh. TIL!  Thanks for that! Super interesting!
Hey kiddo,\n\nI'm praying for you.  I know I can't understand all you're going through, but I wanted you to know my heart hurts for you.  You are worth it.  I know you're an atheist, and I respect that, I just personally found some grace in Christianity I've never seen before.  You don't have to share my views; I just thought I'd let you know.  God loves you!  You are His precious child first and foremost; not man's.  That is super hard to believe when people try to assert dominion over you.  I know that one personally too.\n\nWhen you look at the night sky and the expanse of the stars and the beauty found in all of nature, notice there's a certain peace about it.  There's beauty painted deliberately into the canvas of all we can see.  God made you with that same detail and that same beauty.  We all fall short and that's okay.  We all upset ourselves and that's also fine.  We all struggle.  God doesn't stop loving you.  Take heart and know that even in this situation, you are blessed.  It may not be easy to see right now--who knows, maybe you wind up moving to the US and helping girls who grew up in your situation get free.  Don't just do life for you; picture a friend next to you going through the same stuff and do life for them.\n\nI'll pray for your safe deliverance to a free life and for grace to bloom in the hearts of your parents.  You've seen a tough lifestyle, but that part is only temporary.  Things will get better, just wait.  (Sorry, I know that's probably not what you wanted to hear, but it'll make sense over time).\n\nI'm lifting you up in prayer.  The Lord is with you.

It's good that management isn't out to bust your butt for incident reporting.  This is a cute way to show it!\n\nOurs is pretty sweet! We get a cup of coffee at the hospital coffee shop and a handwritten card from our CEO.  Some people act like since it's a hospital they should give more, but these little gestures are sweet.

You're good! I know only the best of intentions were in your heart. It's a different world out there. I've only been once, but may be there again soon.
I respect your opinion and feel the need to clarify.  That came across wrong without some context around it.  The Creator of all things loves you and called you His own.  This means He will protect you and fight for you.  He is proud of you in every way.  I meant it more of a "God isn't about shame" way.  He isn't about shame.  He's proud of you and will claim that He made you even when you're at your worst.  The pains of the world are real and they do hurt.  Sometimes bad things happen to good people and I wish they didn't, but there's something bigger going on and the One who created love itself is the same One who intentionally made you out of an outpouring of that love.  God has plans to prosper and not harm you, and in Him we can endure even the worst of things.\n\nIf God can love me, He can love anybody. I'm not on this sub to necessarily talk faith, but for some reason, in this one post, it was put on my heart.\n\nI'm sorry if it came across poorly.  Thank you for prompting me to elaborate.
Right there with you!  It's so difficult because no one knows what it's like unless they also have it. I've only been diagnosed for 3 years and I live with 3 roommates and it's so hard when they laugh about the noises that arise from the bathroom.  It's embarrassing, and to go through toilet paper in quantities that should only be reserved for burning to signal a plane....ugh.  It's so difficult to go in public too especially when your friends are waiting on you.  When every time you eat something, someone decides to ask you if it's best for your Crohn's... it's super annoying.  Thanks for your encouragement.\n\nI work in medicine and frequently take care of other Crohn's patients.  Im blessed to have it too.  It lets me know more about what they're going through so I can provide better care.  I'm living with it day by day.  This suffering isn't from God, but He's using it to do something good.

How many beats in a measure.  The top is the number and the bottom is the type of beat. 4/4, otherwise known as "Common Time" is 4 quarter notes per measure. 99% of the stuff on the radio is this time signature.  7/4 is 7 quarter notes per measure. Pink Floyd's "Money" is a great example.  Something that has kind of an oom pa pa sound quickly is a 6/8.  They're 8th note triplets counted as ONE tow three FOUR five six.

A couple years ago, I was working triage and a lady came in hysterical (not unusual) yelling that her husband ran his own head over with the truck.  Just as she said, he comes in the front door with tire tracks across his face, yelling from the agonizing pain only an American made pickup can deliver.\n\nApparently, he was working on it on an incline driveway while his kids were playing in the yard and his truck slipped out of gear and rolled over his head (not super quickly as it barely had enough momentum to keep it going).\n\nI think the craziest thing was that his CTs and X-rays all came out normal. Aside from a little superficial swelling, there were no injuries.  He went home that night.

I'm interested in finding a place.  I'm pretty much the same. I mostly keep to myself unless we do that same thing you and your roommate do (and rock the town).  I'm 28, work two steady jobs, and enjoy hiking, skiing, running, playing guitar (but I'm respectful of your quiet time).  I'm an INTJ, but not a jerk if that makes sense.  I don't party too hard anymore (holiday parties are fun though), but I do enjoy nice craft beers every now and then.  I've found a bunch of places in this range but I need to find a roommate to split them.  PM me if you're interested.

This exactly.  You may even do a little Vaseline for day 1 just because it doesn't evaporate like aquaphor. You may even do a day or two of bacitracin to make keep it super clean.  Vaseline is the most intensive moisture, then do aquaphor to bridge the gap for 2-3 days or until the scar tissue is going down.  Then, use unscented curel (I think it has the green accents on the label depending on where you live) for 3-4 weeks.  This guy is pretty angry.  You can use more lotion than that as well.\n\nThe first comment on this post says to ease up on the moisturizer and let it scab.

One of our math teachers (who also happened to be a baseball coach) lost his marbles when a kid's cell phone went off.  He took it away, took the whole class outside on a "field trip", then proceeded to Barry Bonds that thing for the winning grand slam.  He got a couple hundred feet out of it too!  He then went inside, told his class to follow, then acted like nothing happened.
Hope you thanked him for breakfast or at least threw in a couple IOU's

Throwing a towel in the ring is a technical disqualifying foul committed by the fighter's corner, and ends the fight.  It's not a submission, because only the fighter can submit.  But the workaround is that by throwing something into the ring, the corner has interfered, and disqualified their fighter.
You don't understand how indirect payment works, do you?  Even if your job pays for it, the money is going to him on your behalf, because you watched it.
But for real though, is it possible to achieve nukes by 1350?
There is no better or worse example in this regard.  These fighters were walking zombies going into their finishing rounds.
Machida is 1-3 in his last 4 fights because he's old and has slowed down significantly.  His main advantage over his opponents used to be his speed and quickness.  Also, his last 3 of his last 4 fights were against the most legit fighters the UFC has on their roster.\n\nedit:  Not Dolloway, lol.

This is a really shitty quality picture to be upvoted in a sub dedicated to pictures.
7/10\n\nDecent lines, not the best, definitely not the worst.\n\nWhat frustrates me most about them is their incredibly late money lines.  They wait and wait till just before the games start sometimes.  They are probably watching line movements and adjusting for Sharp activity, but this is really off putting for people who want to try to get early lines.\n\nI've gotten paid by them, but it took a good 4 weeks to get the check, other than that, no problem.\n\nThey have just about every sport you can think of, so that's a huge plus for people into E-Sports and MMA and other niche sports that other books don't have action on.
Welcome to the Machida Era!
wow, what a bitch
That's how you can tell.
you don't deserve to be a gatekeeper if you haven't built a real gate
I would have assumed you would enjoy that.
I would rather have it the way it is with heavy handed moderation.  Historians are running that sub, and they want to keep everything historically fact checked.

7.5/10\n\nI've used Cloudbet, and I'm in the U.S., so maybe their flair should be updated.\n\nI used it mainly for international sports and asian handicap betting (which I still don't fully understand).  Their lines for U.S. sports were not that great, but they have a pretty good sign up bonus.  At the time I was with them last year, they matched you 100% up to 5 Btc.
6.5/10\n\nSo far so good.  They don't always have every sport or every league, but they seem to have American sports covered pretty good.  Their lines aren't that great.  You get a -108 where other sites are giving -105.\n\nTheir website is kind of counter intuitive.  When it comes to organization, BetOnline is the gold standard for me, so that's what I'm comparing it to.\n\nI haven't requested a payout yet, so I have nothing to report on that front.
I wish more corners cared for the safety of their fighters the way Nick cares for Nate in this fight.  Sometimes the towel has to be thrown in.  \n\nMachida should have never been allowed to fight round 2 against Cockhold.  JDS shouldn't have been allowed to continue against Cain in their second fight after the third round.\n\nSo many instances of fights where we are watching brain damage occurring.
where the hell can I bet on the celeb game?  Bovada doesn't have it, and neither does Heritage.\n\nWhat book are you on?
noob question:  What's so wrong about following the recommended items list?
They delete unsubstantiated "facts" and remove people's primary comments that don't have fact checking provided.
Unfortunately, Machida has probably aged out of fighting.  Even if he does return, he'll be a shell of his former self.
So is The Chris.  I don't recall him ever throwing late punches like Hendo or Rampage.
I assume they have rules there, stating what kind of answers are acceptable, and who is allowed to give those answers.  \n\nUnvetted sources are probably not going to get traction from them.  Explain to them why you are qualified to give historical answers.
since pizza was invented, apparently
Machida came back from that concussion way too early.
Gall
Yes, but who else is there to move up? Even bigger lol.
I wish they would.  In this regard, boxing is light years ahead of MMA.  Doctors will call stoppages whenever they feel like a fighter has had enough.

Would you want blood on your clothes, regardless of whether it was a dress or pants?\n\nShe should have worn protective coveralls, maybe.  But to act like any doctor who doesn't expect bloody clothes is bad at their job is just weird. 
Longhorns don't do weird shit like this.  They just drink.
0/10\n\nThey leave bets up after they have been settled, and when you try to take that action, **THAT THEY LEFT UP ON THEIR SITE**, they suspend your account.\n\nMy story:  One of the Hillary/Donald prop bets had already been determined two days before the debate.  Every other sportsbook took the bet off the boards and settled it.  I placed a bet, knowing the outcome, and then my account is suspended, and I am told that the only way to resolve this is to speak via chat to their manager, Tony.\n\nI chat with Tony.  I ask him if this is about the Hillary bet.  He calls me a douchebag and tells me "Figure it out yourself."  I ask him if they are gonna hold my money and prevent me from withdrawing my winnings that I had before this bet.  He tells me to fuck off, and "Happy Thanksgiving."\n\nYes, I took advantage of their stupidity, and placed a bet on a known outcome.  But whose responsibility is that?\n\nI kept trying to get someone to answer that question.  Who is responsible for keeping the bet up after the outcome was determined?  No straight answers anywhere.  Not from their manager Tony, or any of their telephone reps.\n\nSo, my money is suspended in my account, presumably never to be seen again.  I just consider it an expensive lesson learned.\n\n**THESE PEOPLE LEAVE BETS UP AFTER OUTCOMES HAVE BEEN DETERMINED, THEN FREEZE YOUR MONEY IF YOU PLAY THOSE BETS**
holy shit that #2 post, lol

I wish betting exchanges would become popular in the US.
ehh
Interesting.  I haven't been back on there since my bankroll ran out last year, and I jumped ship to the next book that had a nice bonus.  I'll try to get back on and report back.
Holy shit.  I want to believe that he's being punished for something.  But based on the stories some of my army friends have told me, this could just be part of his assigned tasks.

That's weak.  4 of Bisping's biggest losses were to PED abusers, so his sensitivity to fighting known cheaters is very justifiable.
The Leslie Jones effect.  All that does is highlight how shitty the work is (or potentially will be, in this case).
100% agree with you that the pitcher needs to control the pace of the game.  But officials aren't so stupid.  If you plunk a guy in the head while being mocked by the crowd, that's probably an automatic warning.  Do it again, and it's ejection city, with a possible game suspension from the NCAA coming up.
The Rockhold concussion.  His corner shouldn't have even allowed him to answer the bell in the 2nd round.  More unnecessary damage, then only a 2 month layoff before fighting Gay Jesus.
Novak Jokovic.  Men's tennis great.
Black Beast gonna check on Ronda

I think going after kids for being cringy is just unfair and too easy.
FUCK!  Forgot about shenanigans. This fight will probably be a fix, like Kimbo/Shamrock.
me too thanks
He is the oldest president we have had in a very long time.  Health is a serious consideration in these bets as well.  He is the second fattest president ever, behind Taft.  Combined with his age, 70, this bet might have value.\n\nNow granted, 70 is not that old anymore, and he has the best health care in the world, so that has to be taken into account as well.
I'm not very smart.  The joke here is that time has had no effect on Fedor, right?

The topic at hand is that there are homeless that choose to be homeless. Perhaps bad choices was a bad choice of words, but the point still stands that many choose to be homeless and use charities to survive. \n\nThose that do not want to be homeless often can find government sponsored programs that require them to try to find a job, but help them, and they do great in my area. 
But that isn't on job training, which is what is at debate here.\n\nDo min wage jobs provide the training needed? Not do company benefit packages include it. \n\nI agree it isn't the best example, but as you pointed out you need to work more than 20 hours. Min wage, part time workers don't get that. 
Sure. Imagine he said. ... Before you buy a yacht, make sure your neighbor has food. \n\nIf someone dies while someone buys a third jet, would preventing that death be considered bad? 
that is true, and in the real world the person sees the neighbor has no food and thinks, "I'm glad I'm not him". 
Mel Brooks history of the world part 1 was the reference. He is a "stand-up philosopher" to which the unemployment office says, "oh, your a bullshitter" then proceeds to ask if he bullshited this week, tried to bullshit, etc. 
so you are saying if you got 1000/yr in lower taxes, you would take 100% of that and donate it? hell, you might donate 110% to make up for others who don't right? 
I agree with most but you should know the feeding the homeless is because in these areas, it is attracting homeless people who do not want to get off welfare. My local area has this group because 3 or so churches in the area feed them. As a result, you can't even use trails because you will be assaulted by these homeless. And locking them up they just return after you let them out (if you can even prove who it was). \n\nSo making feeding the homeless illegal has been actually the best policy. You can feed the homeless through government programs that require you to look for a job, etc. 
So modern media, which is privately funded is all biased. The publicly funded news is the least biased.\n\nYour solution is to make the publicly funded, least biased program to be like the biased media you hate? 
Is a country that nominates and elects Trump a country looking for stability? 
Is it like pleasuring yourself when the real problem is you don't have a GF? Because that might hit closer to home for more. 
There are homeless because of bad choices,and homeless because they choose. My area has many who choose to be homeless yet use charity to survive. 
If they could make different charges for crack and cocaine simply because whites did one more... I bet they can figure out how to ban Muslims. \n\nIt will be something like... "Prayer mats are now considered dangerous weapons, bringing one into america means instant deport".\n\nSee, no mention of Muslims. 
I read the first vacation from Obama was like Mid April, while Trump's first was beginning of Feb. \n\nAlso, Trump railed against Obama for golfing while we had such a bad economy, but Trump says it is worse economy now yet he vacations. 
what skills does a min wage get you? I have worked many min wage jobs growing up, and I got no skills that translate into the skills I use today. \n\nI keep hearing to learn skills, okay... what skills. You work at starbucks, what skills are you going to "learn" that you didn't know before that will apply to future work? Working the point of sale system that takes less than 1 day to learn? 
I feel like most of this is stuff he wouldn't even think about apologizing for except the world / media is coming down on him. He constantly insults and pushes the edge, and he got burned. \n\nLet's not forget he is a gay man by choice who is unable to choose to be straight. Just try to wrap your head around that one. 
You actually proved my point. Women lack power in Saudi Arabia, and you see no women in power. Just like America.... While their is done via law, ours is self-regulated. \n\nMy point is that they just as much women there as they are here (biologically). So any biological argument as to why women "choose" to stay at home is proven wrong by Sweden. \n\nAnd even on the size issue, let's take it down to state level. Why doesn't TN have 50/50 on the state level? or even city level? \n\nRegardless of the number of political offices, women is Sweden are just as likely to run for office as men. The number of open positions doesn't really affect that. 
Your list doesn't show where it conflicts with the constitution. \n\nFor example, and I'll address more when you comment again, the first amendment already has a regulation around it about screaming fire in a public place for no reason. \n\nAccording to an originality, you can scream "fire", or "shooter" in a theater (or a public park) and nothing should go wrong, it is free speech and there is nothing in the constitution restricting where and when you can do free speech. \n\nYou are right, a living constitution says, "yes, we understand you want freedom of speech, but yelling shooter in a park is not what that amendment is trying to protect." 
How? 9th says things not listed as a power cannot be done by the federal government, but national protection is. So can the NSA spy on everyone for national security? According to the 9th, they can. 
Are those min wage jobs? Every cook job I have seen has been higher than min wage. 
You know who also denies it, people who know it isn't real.\n\nTake this wonderful quote...\n\n"The first thing round earthers do is deny the earth is flat"
So in Sweden, they have a good mix of women to men. Are they not women over there? 
If I am not mistaken, the vagina monologues are taken from real interviews. It is not passing judgement on those women, merely retelling their stories. \n\nI imagine they could have found others. 
> As a man, what am I to do about the biology of birthing children?\n\nSeek understanding. To realize that not all women want to magically stay at home. That regardless of biology, we should still be able to pursue our dreams. 
Only where unconstitutional laws exist.  Augmenting my memory is a natural right.
So who incited the violence? Milo or the protesters? If milo never went, would there have been violence? \n\nby your definition, I think you could easily argue Milo was the inciter. He knows this is the kind of reaction he gets yet he still pushes to go there. So in a very real sense, he is inciting it. 
Obama had 365 in 08, yet the gop said he didn't have a mandate. Yet Trumps 306 is suppose to be? 
So when the 3rd amendment says "house", does that include an RV that you live in? Because if it isn't a living document, then the answer is no. A house and an RV are different.\n\nIf you are a living document, then the RV is your house, and thus protected. \n\nSo if you lived out of your RV, would you say it is your house? or would you say you have no 3rd amendment right and military can stay in your RV against your consent? 
> How to show up on time to do a job at a regular interval\n\nThis isn't a skill. You really need to "learn" this? \n\n>How to interface with customers\n\nDoesn't teach you that, and only applies to jobs that are retail, which are min wage jobs. \n\n>How to manage your own money (income)\n\nWorking min wage doesn't help you at that at all. If it is kids working min wage, they have no need to manage their own money. \n\n>How a particular business model works\n\nThat isn't min wage, unless you can provide me examples. Every min wage job I worked, I was not allowed to know how the business works. Those were considered for management, no min wage jobs.\n\n\n>How to understand customer preferences and react to further win-win sales.\n\nhave you worked min wage jobs? that is so far from the truth for any min wage job. 
Perhaps I am wrong here, but to me a left-libertarian is basically a libertarian that feels in a conflict between the individual vs a company, the individual gets the favor. This is simply because the individual lacks much of the power that a company has.\n\nAs far as regulations, it is more about creating the rules to the game, that everyone is playing. When you play a game of monopoly, you start the game agreeing on the rules, if a conflict comes up you resolve it. Imagine playing Monopoly with no rules. Remember, even contract law is a regulation on the free market. \n
Right after space balls 2, the search for more money. 
Most pet shops sell pet gear. PetSmart makes very little of the pet. Also, retail pets tend to be treated very poorly. Not given enough exercise, etc. 
Look, it is about religious freedom and not denying flowers for a gay wedding. See, if this employee did it, then by viture of owning a floral store, employing someone, having them do work, that in somehow relates to a wedding, god will punish you. \n\nI know this might sound confusing, but don't get it mixed up with buying a diamond ring that was most likely harvested with slave labor. \n\nGod will punish the first thing, but encourages the latter. (you know, to celebrate gods love)
Okay, part of the recent sequestration was government getting out of charity. They also had a record donation that same year, which came up to about 50% of the money lost due to the cuts. (i.e. a 1M cut resulted in only 500k in donations)\n\nSo let me ask you, did you start donating to the food bank since the sequestration and are you donating more than what you got back? 
If they break the law, such as raping, then they need to be put in jail. 
Actual current state law said that businesses open to the public must serve anyone belonging to the public. So yes, they violated it. 
not just Catholics, but Pentecostals as well. I think mormons might be included as well. I wish it was only a small subset, but it reaches a bit more. \n\nHobby Lobby claims to be non-denominational, not catholic. 
So why require abortion providers to have ER access if it is only about tax dollars? Keeping in mind prostate work is higher risk and doesn't require ER access. 
Also many of these middle states are not immigrant friendly, which is a large chunk of the tech sector. 
> General people skills, how to work with management.\n\nI got those from school. I socialized with people, and my management (aka teachers) had work assignments and what not. \n\n>try to imagine never working a day in your life until age 25 when you are starting your career.\n\nIn my field (software engineering), this is actually fairly common. Many people in my friend have no prior experience outside of their first job in software engineering. Somehow, they got by without those skills. 
Well he has lied about them so often, it is hard to keep track as to which one was the truth. 
"Now people are going to say I ranted and raved..." \n\n*rants and raves*\n\n"See! the lying media said I was ranting and raving!"
Yes you can... why do you think you can't? Organize it. The woman's march was organized off of a tweet. If people really do care about the topics, they will show up. 
Actually be can't give it up. He could donate it, but legally he has to take it. \n\nMaybe if we saw his taxes we would know which charities are getting a bump. 
That used to be the case, then we had a series of news reports about the abuse of such animals go through and it all but ended that kind of retail. If you want a custom breed, you find a breeder and buy direct now. \n\nThere are still a few, but ever since those news reports (late 90s I think), it hasn't been the same. 
I don't think you know what a living document is. You are right it is looking at what the writers might have meant, but it is also reading the law it would apply today. If the law says house, that doesn't include RV. That would require a living document reading. \n\nA living document, beyond figuring out what the original intent was, is also to read more than what the plan text has. \n\nread up on scalia and his view of the consitution. You were to read it word for word, nothing more, nothing less. Unless it specifically said RV, then RVs are not considered a house. (in relation to the 3rd).\n\n
My only caution about this is you can be impeached if they can show you are trying to abuse your power. If his ban is rejected again, maybe they can show it. 
> women are self funding planned parenthood\n\nThey said this about the food bank, and the following year the donations didn't come in. But we live in the moment right? 
Trump said crime was on the rise... 
I think the left-libertarians feel for Bernie is the desire to give all people and equal chance. Not equal outcomes, equal chances. For instance there was a report not long ago about how one school district had basically zero computers, while a neighbor school less than 1 hour away had top of the line computers. \n\nNow if we need more software engineers, do you think the poor school with no computers will be cranking out software engineers? \n\nI am not defending Bernie, merely pointing out the appeal. As I said before, left-libertarians tend to want to make the rules for the game, but not pick a winner or loser. \n\nFor those interested, I think the veil of ignorance is a rather good way to look at left-libertarian. If you could design your world not knowing if you would be born poor or rich, how would you design it. Personally, when it came to education, I would want that whatever life I was born into, I had a chance to use computers to advance it. 
or those nice housing programmings for vets. \n\nor all those vocational education in high school.
He'll need 2 cells... ba-zing!
I think it could be seen either way. Yes you can amending it either way, and in that sense it is a living document. But I think in this context it is how you interrupt it. \n\nLiving document says, "we should seek to understand the purpose, and make sure that purpose still applies today." So like the 3rd amendment... \n\n>No soldier shall, in time of peace be quartered in any house, without the consent of the owner, nor in time of war, but in manner to be prescribed by law.\n\nNow under the non-living document, a house would mean literally a house. Under a living document, a house would mean an RV, a tent, or any place that you consider your home. \n\nSee that difference? One reads it literally while the other one says, "the founders had no idea RVs would exist in the future, so this law should apply to RVs, even though it doesn't say it." 
I would make it Nov 2018, and until then he is a lame duck. Limit the EOs and basically make him a figurehead until we can hold another election. 
What they would do is limit the headscarf in various locations in suspension of not being able to see your face. Like a store does no masks, I could easily see the president doing something like, No hijab in US airports. 
Was not written by Devos?
I haven't played but there was a few levels like that, but not all. You just choose the loud missions unless you have a full stealth setup. 
so my neighbor has cancer and doesn't feel like telling me that. You are saying it is his fault for not telling everyone he has cancer so he can get help? Government allows you to be discrete. 
no, it was exact opposite, to the point that the people who wrote the law were in the same room and he refused to listen to them. \n\nAny extra documents outside the written law was too much for Scalia. If you wanted the 3rd to include RVs, then you amend it, but unless it says RVs, the 3rd shouldn't protect that. \n\nHell, he made an argument once that sexism was perfectly legit according to the Constitution because it didn't restrict it. 
I hate the to state solution and prefer the to federal solution. 
I thought the trips to Mar-A-Lago were for interviewing people, thus it would be a business trip and not a personal trip. 
I don't think that was a bill was it? I thought it was an EO. 
That is odd, what I see is they reach /r/all then new people join. They see the crazy in it and question it, but then are banned for questioning it. 
So when we put a sunlight on the fact obama was in fact a US citizen, we still had how many years of that going on?\n\nOh, and do we discount 9/11 conspiracies? \n\nThese items have been talked to death, and yet people still believe them. Hell, go onto some subs around here and see people talking about how blacks are genetically more violent. \n\nSo how would having someone talk about how blacks are more violent (which is growing in popularity recently, not declining) going to make this reduction? 
>  I was glad when took a penny a year salary\n\nHe didn't, legally he cannot. He said he would, but he hasn't because he can't. 
It should be a prominent issue, because it is big problem.  Apart from military adventurism, drug prohibition is one of worst in regards to wasteful spending in terms of both size and scope.
> Anyways I think meme is wrong because it implies that somehow the federal government has its own money as if it isn't funded entirely by American's.\n\nThat isn't what I read for what it implies. To me it implies that SS is a function system, but due to crony capitalism, congress was able to raid it. \n\nSo we hear a lot about how SS is dying, but that doesn't make sense as on the balance sheets, it is doing amazing. 
>  I don't know that most constitutional scholars would take Scalia seriously on that point.\n\nThat depends on if you are an originalist or not. If you are, then it makes perfect sense. If you are a living document type guy, then it doesn't. \n
I have had no issue getting any of my guns in California or Oregon. I'm a hunter and I trap shoot. Never had issues. 
Right, what makes more sense, spending 1mil helping our spending 3mil?
There actually is a shirt and campaign about "bad guys" after the immigration ban to get the "bad guys". \n\nYes, this is already being done, and there is already a march planned for the Nasty Women and Bad Guys... it is schedule around the correspondents dinner time? 
Yes I do. So myself is a case in point that people like me exist. 
Well many women don't like it. I can't remember but I believe Devos or Conway said that women were too emotional to vote, and their real purpose is in the house with the kids. \n\nI mean you are fighting against a group of women and men that believe if we empower women, they will eat the apple again. 
> The guy is basically a bullshitter.\n\nYou mean a stand-up philosopher? 
Fake social, then don't file a return. Basically they went investigate people who would result in the government owing. \n\nThen sales tax. \n\nThen property tax via rent. \n\nGas tax to drive. \n\nPark fees. They also eat at local places. 
Lassie from the TV show Lassie had something like 6 dog actors play her. 
that sounds like an argument for the reverse. Why should vets get special treatment when they choose to enlist while a black person who is discriminated against has no option. 
So weed was put into law to target mexicans (We have it in public records as part of the debate). It is still illegal today. 
I didn't give up moral relativism, but I do believe some morals are better than others. Such as not selling your daughter to her rapist (absolute moral from god). 
off topic, but I wish to prove Hobby Lobby's faith, it had to donate 10% (before tax!) to charity. \n\nBe like, "Okay, you are religious, you don't need to provide condoms, but we expect you to follow your religion and tithe" 
something changing in the democratic party is they are becoming the party of capitalists. Starting with Clinton, the democrats have embraced much more freedom of business. This is contrary to Sanders, but is partly why some democrats feel they are losing middle class america. \n\nIt might be easier to convince democrats who already believe in the freedom of the individual to be swayed that businesses need freedoms as well. I know many democrats that are fine with helping out small businesses, it is the 500+ employee companies that they feel are not the same. 
I guess that depends. Outright ban, you are correct, but there are virtual bans. In Louisiana they had to fight to keep the last abortion clinic active. Yes you could go to another state, but it was basically banned in that state through regulation.\n\nThen in Texas, some places is a 3 hour drive and 48 hour waiting period before driving back to get the abortion.\n\nYeah, banning things won't work, but we can regulate them out of existence. 
So a us citizen kills your family, the only witness is an illegal immigrant. Do you deport them? or find the killers? \n\nRight now, it sounds like you are saying to deport them, which to anyone who has lost a loved one to violent crime would take insult to. 
Funny, the media lies about trump, but tells the truth about blm?
remember, Obama got 360'ish, but that wasn't a mandate. 
I'm surprised it is 2 people and not just one black Asian gay woman that is post op. You know, get all those minorities wrapped into one person so you don't dilute your power. 
Milo was defending it, not telling his story of his 17 on 29. He uses that story to justify pedophilia. That makes it worlds different. 
To the originalist, the specific religious beliefs and quotes don't matter. You read the text and only the text. \n\nScalia is the perfect example, he was against ACA, saying that by the letter of the law, it means a certain thing. The people who wrote the law were still in congress and they said, "no, we didn't mean it like that at all." Didn't matter, Scalia reads the letter and nothing more. \n\nA living document takes into consideration the views and the desires of why the law was written. If you bring in any other document other than the exact letters of the constitution, you are making it into a living document. 
While a good point, she should be losing them because she's a terrible person.
just to point out that Christian nations, at least those that followed the OT had a state charity. The priesthood was to take a portion of the tithing for the poor. Funny that Christians talk about charity when the state forced charity back in the OT days. 
While I get that some things will not be entirely equal, I think we should work to remove any extra baggage from that equation. Yes, being pregnant and giving birth will take time out of your life, but it shouldn't take 18 years if you don't want it to.

From everything I have read about pay gaps, if that is what your wife was doing, then she has the potential to make far more income. So why didn't you encourage her to start / expand the business while you let your masters degree waste away? 
>affirmative action is the set of actions and policies that would favor groups (mostly minority groups)\n\nNot in america. AA is a law that makes discrimination based on race illegal, but that is it. There is no requirement to prefer one person over another, and there is ZERO QUOTAs (caps because every time I say this, someone says there are). \n\nWiki does it well:\n\n>In the United States, affirmative action tends to emphasize not specific quotas but rather "targeted goals" to address past discrimination in a particular institution or in broader society through "good-faith efforts ... to identify, select, and train potentially qualified minorities and women."[1][10] For example, many higher education institutions have voluntarily adopted policies which seek to increase recruitment of racial minorities.[11] Another example is executive orders requiring some government contractors and subcontractors to adopt equal opportunity employment measures,[12] such as outreach campaigns, targeted recruitment, employee and management development, and employee support programs.[13]

You know this did happen? What they did was "adopt" their spouse so that they could have shared benefits. This is an issue recently with the passing of gay marriage that some gays cannot marry because you are not allowed to marry a family member. So these couples that adopted each other cannot get married because of how they got around the law the first time. 
Except for privacy, as in my link, came about from a 1900s case. It required a living document interruption of it. \n\nNothing in the 4th amendment says you have a right to privacy of using condoms, yet the courts ruled that way by reading more into the law than what is written.

Before V, there was The Matrix.  The movie was built on the premise of individual choice, and themes of institutional slavery.  Individuals could be liberated from "the system", but only by choice.

The problem is, the grammar is so terrible, it forces the reader to "over think" just to understand what you're trying to say.  If the impedance is such an issue in the first few paragraphs, readers (like me) will assume the whole essay is like that, and quit trying.\n\nPoor grammar appears unprofessional.  You have no existing credibility to fall back on.  Even if the reader finishes the essay--if you don't take your position seriously; it's hard to for your reader to take it seriously either.

I also think that it's quite possible that the people he got in exchange may have already going to be voting for Gary anyway.  His "trade" may have been a waste.

Jeeez... they really went too far down the rabbit hole by bringing up native Americans.  For a hypothetical discussion about property rights in general, going into how Europeans violated native american's property rights was entirely unnecessary.  \n\nThe hunter/gatherer scenario was great.  It showed how property rights were protected BEFORE government existed.  Homesteading was brought up to describe initial property creation.  Then the caller completely bails on arguing about hypothetical homesteading and the concept of legitimate property acquisition; redirecting to specifics about the American continent.

You don't seem to understand what I mean by augmentation, or my statement that I have a right to remember.  There will come a day where video recording is fully integrated into our biology, and storage so cheap that it makes sense to record literally everything in our lives--potentially to the point where there is no "off switch".  That is, it becomes literally an extension of our own memory.  You have no right to force me to forget what I observe.

Almost.  The DOD in its basic form is constitutional.
This may have occurred.\n\nThat said, there was plenty of property taken by force by early pilgrims/settlers, and eventually English colonists prior to USA's existence.  \n\nThe caller's premise regarding inherited stolen property wasn't necessarily wrong (although Stephan does make some good points).  However, it was off-topic, and doesn't apply generally to the concept of property ownership.
I find it interesting that the CPD's press release indicates what candidates satisfy the ballot access criterion (Trump, Clinton, Johnson, and Stein).  They also call out who recommended the polling orgs and their "reasoning."\n\n> With respect to the third criterion, on August 15, 2016, CPD announced the five polls it would rely upon, which were selected with the professional advice of Dr. Frank Newport, Editor-in-Chief of Gallup. The polls were selected based on: the reliable frequency of polling and **sample size** used by the polling organization; the **soundness of the survey methodology** employed by the polling organization; and the longevity and reputation of the polling organization. The five selected polls are: ABC-Washington Post; CBS-New York Times; CNN-Opinion Research Corporation; Fox News; and NBC-Wall Street Journal.\n\nBoth the sample size and survey methodology are in question.  The sample sizes were clearly not acceptable if some of the polls couldn't even accurately represent millennials or independents.  It's also poor methodology (for a poll being used by CPD) for not polling Gary in the first question.

Trying to get people to adopt the libertarian ideology is tough to do in a single "post."  Trying to convince people to vote for Gary is tough too, but slightly easier (depending on the audience).  If you're trying to convince an existing Trump/Hillary supporter, you don't really have a chance--If they haven't walked away already, they won't.  \n\nAs for the undecided voter, I suggest using Gary's/Bill's own pitch to sell them:\n\n* Fiscally conservative\n* Socially tolerant (I know actual libertarians hate this simplistic conveyance of our principals, but that's not who we're trying to convince)\n* Two former GOP govs in Dem states\n* Both re-elected in landslides\n* Capable of reaching across the isle\n* Both cut taxes\n* Both cut spending\n* Both had surpluses\n* Both were able to provide "roads and education" (yes, fucking roads)\n* Gary is able to manage government and business resources--given he's also ran a successful business\n* Both are competent leaders

> my mom literally was voting for Hillary because she wanted to see the first female president.\n\nSorry, but it's sad that people like this actually exist.\n\nIn early 2016 I joked many times that Michelle Obama should run for president, because she could trump Hillary in the identity politics game.  Now that the election is over, I've seen people seriously suggesting this exact idea.
> The outrage among Utah conservatives over the recording has allowed Democrats to begin to contemplate what was once unthinkable: taking the state for Mrs. Clinton in November. The hope is that disaffected Republicans will abandon Mr. Trump and split their votes between two third-party candidates: Gary Johnson of the Libertarian Party and Evan McMullin, a former C.I.A. official who is a Mormon.\n\nIt's frustrating not to hear them flat out going to Johnson.  Particularly from a state that Gary has been strong in poll-wise.\n\nSimilarly, it's equally frustrating to hear GOP members retract their endorsement of Trump, and then pretend that Gary doesn't exist.  If they really wanted to hurt Trump, they'd endorse Johnson.
At [17:00](https://youtu.be/k3O01EfM5fU?t=17m), he makes an excellent summary.
I'm OK with standardized tests.  I'm not really a fan of gov't mandated standards though.  Different competing standards should exist; and if an organization claims to support a standard, it should be able to prove it.\n\nIn the context of public money, I guess I think it's acceptable to restrict vouchers to institutions with accredited standards.  If you want to send your child to a high risk/non-standard institution, that's your right; however, I don't think it automatically should qualify for vouchers.
Even if econ was taught, the rest of the public school model is a totalitarian regime.
I don't blame Gary for not wanting to debate with EggMcMuffin on stage w/o Darrell Castle.  McMullin isn't even on enough ballots to win.
Immigrants should be able to live here without any documentation.  They should be exempt from income taxes but also government benefits.

Your rights end where other people's rights begin. \n\nThat said, I would like some kind of universal healthcare option that's open to all as long as the private sector can still exist (think Canada.) SO LONG as it's not achieved through additional taxes. Shave off some money from our ridiculous military spending.\n\n>Ensure universal education as a right.\n\nBasically the same argument as above. Just because you really like something doesn't mean you can label it as a right.\n\n>Block the TPP\n\nTrump already did.\n\n>Enact common-sense gun regulation\n\nFuck off. \n\n>Ensure paid vacation time, sick time, maternity leave, childcare.\n\nShould be up to the employer.

If you're talking about: \n>does not provide immunity from criminal liability for any use of force beyond reasonable force\n\nYou'll notice in the video at 1:50 the trespasser says they will throw her ass over the hill and the security guard responds by pushing the trespasser away. The trespasser responds by putting her in a headlock, then choking her, and bringing her to the ground before pummeling her.\n\nSo basically the security guard (an agent of the owner or lessee) used, what looks to me, like reasonable force. She then got the shit beat out of her and tried to defend herself.\n\n\n\n\n\n
It'd be neat to see how much the tax payers have to pay for the settlements totaled annually, with calculations for how much each tax payer winds up paying individually. They could send it out to everyone who paid taxes that year like a billing statement. 
>then the Republican party is where you want to go\n\nI'm a Libertarian and I'm not against people earning living wages, I'm against the minimum wage being a living wage. Not all jobs are deserving of a living wage. Jobs should be worth what the employer and employee decide on.\n\nI own multiple guns as well and the current background checks we have in place are already more than adequate. I'm more concerned with Justice Democrats position on "assault weapons," high-capacity magazines, and gun buyback programs. If they were really concerned with firearm related deaths then they'd be tackling the mental health issue. People aren't killing people just because there are guns, they're killing people because they're mentally ill. Going after a constitutionally protected right instead of going after the root cause is asinine. \n\n>And people shouldn't have to work 40-50 hours a week and still need to get food stamps and public housing assistance; that's coming out of your taxes but I guess you don't care about that.\n\nI agree but it's not a dichotomous issue and taxing everyone who is somehow managing to make a living, in a world you just admitted is hard to get by in, isn't the solution.\n

Trump is gonna give people plenty of reasons to throw shade his way without people having to fabricate ways to make him look bad.\n\nAttendance at Trump's inauguration was more or less in line with the norm if you compare it to Bush's, Clinton's, etc.\n\n- President Bill Clinton, 1993: 800,000 people\n- President Bill Clinton, 1997: 250,000 people\n- President George W. Bush, 2001: 300,000 people\n- President George W. Bush, 2005: 400,000 people\n- President Barack Obama, 2009: 1.8 million people\n- President Barack Obama, 2013: 1 million people\n\nObama's first inauguration was record-breaking. He had 1.8 million in attendance, which ended up being greater than **any** inauguration in the past.

Trump may have some hires that are anti drug, but he's not.  I guarantee he's done some marijuana.  He was rich in the 80s, I *know* he's snorted coke.   Because that's what rich people did in the 80s.  \n\nPolicy falls from the president, not the cabinet.  If it becomes a negative, Trump will set policy.  Right now being anti-drug is *not* negative, so Trump just lets inertia go.

The congress has explicit authority to limit who enters the country, including the ability to restrict by religion or national origin.  Fact.  Congress transferred that authority to the president, with the exclusion of national origin restrictions.  Fact.  Congress then allowed the President to create a list of "Countries of Concern" which could be restricted by national origin.  Fact.  Obama created that list in 2016.  Fact.  That list is what is being used for Trump's EO.

What if they refused to stop a fire until they ensured someone could pay for it?\n\n[If you're the government, you let it burn.](http://www.nbcnews.com/id/39516346/ns/us_news-life/t/no-pay-no-spray-firefighters-let-home-burn/#.WKIprzsrLDc) I can't speak as to what hypothetical future free market fire protection agencies would do. I can imagine that they would put a premium on fire prevention, which would mean equipment and/or training to get a reduced rate, advanced notification systems, and maybe even fire-proof housing to begin with in new developments.
I agree 100% with this. But using something in an unusual way does not make it incorrect. It's also entirely possible that Trump ACTUALLY DID think he was still alive. However, it's simply not correct to say that because he used it this way, he 100% thinks that Douglass is alive. It's still "proper" English, although uncommon. \n\nWith all the real good reasons to jump all over Trump, this one wasn't worth anybody's attention. He's never been a good speaker and mangles the language consistently. But in this case "look how dumb he is" is especially funny considering that he's not even incorrect. \n\nResponse to edit: It's kind of vague because Trump was talking about the past, yes (Douglass has done great things) but also tying it into the present (and he's getting more and more recognition). In this context WHEN Douglass did the work isn't really important. If you want try to nail down a timeline about when Douglass did his work (100 years ago), then the past tense becomes preferred:\n\n> We use the Present Perfect to say that an action happened at an unspecified time before now. The exact time is not important. You CANNOT use the Present Perfect with specific time expressions such as: yesterday, one year ago, last week, when I was a child, when I lived in Japan, at that moment, that day, one day, etc. We CAN use the Present Perfect with unspecific expressions such as: ever, never, once, many times, several times, before, so far, already, yet, etc.
Except for the whole nationalization of corporations, price controls, and the expansion of the welfare state......
GO EAGLES!
You can try rubbing lemon pledge on your furniture where they scratch. Cats HATE citrus. It worked when one of mine was always scratching at the door.
> They get to sit with the Jews,Irish, Italians and other model minorities\n\nWe did it! Everybody to the pub!
"It's cool though because MY brand of political speech will never fall out of favor!"
That said, I do love being able to post things from liberal sites to my friends, because I know they'll take it more seriously. 
Right, you just want to commit violence against those people. Totally different, and totally okay! \n\nMeanwhile, in America, we have freedom of speech, so this guy gets to spout all the bullshit he wants, and you can fight back with words. If you punch people like this, THEY GET STRONGER. You'd think the left would learn SOMETHING after getting fucking Donald Trump elected.
Well, in my mind Bernie is exactly the wrong solution, because he continually advocates more government. He at least understands the problems (financial sector is robbing us blind) but his solutions are to put the government in charge of it instead, instead of having an actual free market economy. I know as soon as I had a reasonable currency alternative, I abandoned the dollar as much as I could. That said, it's hard enough for libertarians to find allies, and we need to admit when he's right about the problem, and then try to improve his solutions. \n\nI think that the biggest boost we got in this election cycle is that Bernie supporters now "see through the game" in the same way that Ron Paul supporters did in '12 especially. How frustrating is it to show up at the caucus and know the rules, and win fairly, then hear on the news "Ron Paul supporters using arcane rules grab all the delegate slots!" Umm....we showed and played by your stupid rules! At least admit when you lose! This momentum is going to build into something, I'm just not sure what it will be in the end.
> I'm okay with punching people for believing everyone they dislike needs to be tortured and murdered.\n\nThe thing is, here's exactly what I and a whole bunch of free speech advocates see when you say that:\n\n"I'm okay with [committing violence against] people for believing everyone they dislike needs to [have violence committed against them]."
And a reminder to be afraid in the first place.
Well hopefully one day we'll be able to look at a libertarian society, and then decide what to do from there. ;) 
> They have civil, non-violent gatherings, because they're the only ones allowed to do so. Organize an LGBT group, a black advocacy group, a Muslim prayer gathering, and god damn watch those rights evaporate in a hurry. \n\nWTF are you talking about? Groups have meetings like this literally every day.
Anytime. I apologize if I inadequately explained my positions. I honestly have no problem with local taxes for firefighting, I just think it's also not an unsolvable problem in a free market. :) Have a great day! 
At this point I basically auto friend anybody who actually uses quick chat in solo standard. So far I'm up to 2 people in 3 months :/
If you have people do busywork, they waste their time. When you provide a basic safety net, people can unleash their creativity and passions. This results in faster technological improvements as well as an increase in aid to the less fortunate (mostly as volunteer man hours).
> sorry, i meant to include one wouldn't need fire insurance if their neighbor is already paying. instead of having 80% of the people pay, just tax 100% so there's no cheats.\n\nThere's no guarantee that a fire in your home is going to endanger your neighbor's property. By the time it's large enough to endanger neighbors, your house is going to be pretty well gone. \n\nRemember, fire protection services want your house to never catch on fire in the first place because they'll have to pay for the damages you suffer. Even if the fire eventually gets put out by a fire service you didn't pay for, you're on your own after that.\n\n> And you're right the government already did it over a 75$ fee but that was one occurrence which rarely happens. 99% of fire departments will fight it anyways besides its good practice.\n\nWhich is why I have a sneaking suspicion that private companies would also do this, although they have no moral obligation to do so. It garners good press, and good press is important when you have to actually compete for customers. \n\nI just think it's funny when people use this argument and I can point to the government doing the exact thing they say is unacceptable ;)\n\n
> These guys are so wealthy that nobody can compete with them.\n\nPeople are competing with WalMart right now, and they are winning because people like you and I disagree with WalMart's business model and don't shop there.
They just come over and have kids who can vote.
Yup. We have a nice libertarian streak running through us down here. (Comparatively) 
That's what I was hoping after the election, but the left doesn't seem to be interested in the argument that the president has too much power, just that Trump specifically has too much power. We've got four years to bring them around, though......
It's easy to be for free speech when you agree with what's being said. But if you aren't for free speech when you hate being said, you're not really for free speech at all.
In a libertarian society, the whole economy wouldn't rely on oil to that degree, and without nationalization of corporations and price controls, you could weather the downturn in prices much better than the sandcastle that is socialism. 
Great news! Things are looking up more and more the closer we get to the season.
> The fact that the Constitution has been amended 3 times in the past 50 years (1967-2017) compared to 7 times in the 50 years preceding that (1916-1966) suggests that it has gotten considerably harder to amend the Constitution.\n\nI'd say it speaks more to the fact that they don't even bother with the window dressing anymore.
There's a good reason so many of us are well-versed in questions like "Who will build the roads?!?!?!", and it's because we've been seeing the same exact questions from "newbies" to libertarianism for at least as long as I've been paying attention. 
The real problem is: what happens when the people in power decide YOUR speech is the subversive hate speech that needs to be banned?
You're not suffering when the government prints away your purchasing power and gives free money to the banks? You're not suffering when billions and billions are wasted on cronyism instead of helping people? \n\nLibertarian doesn't mean no government. If we scaled it back, we'd find that we actually have enough wealth to help everybody. Sending it through the sponge of DC isn't the way to do that.
We're literally in a thread where people are celebrating this guy getting punched in the face. You seem to be confused about the difference between freedom of speech and the first amendment. 
ahhaha the winged parakeets is a new one to me, thanks for sharing :)
That's not really how mob mentality works....once you acknowledge that violence is okay against people you REALLY don't like, more and more people get lumped into that category. It's just like the PATRIOT act will ONLY be used against terrorists, honest!
That's not really how English works. His sentence is correct, just badly worded. "Who's done" doesn't imply the guy is still alive.\n\nEdit: I love being downvoted for being correct. Nobody got time to learn anything, just downvote and move on. Trump would love to have you in his administration.
Punching Nazis does more for the Nazi movement than just about anything else could.
The problem is TOO MUCH bipartisanship! Shit like the NSA, the war on drugs, the TSA, foreign policy, monetary policy, that's ALL bipartisan. The wedge issues are to distract you from the much bigger shit that they agree on.
We understand that because taxation is theft, it should be done very sparingly and the money should be well spent. The government is in charge of running the courts and providing national defense, as well as being a neutral arbiter in interstate disputes. If we scaled back the government to this Constitutional size, we wouldn't be losing nearly half our income to taxes. 
Generally it is, but that's not a set in stone rule, because English is dumb that way. The way that Trump used it was uncommon, but not incorrect. \n\n>The PRESENT PERFECT TENSE is formed with a present tense form of "to have" plus the past participle of the verb (which can be either regular or irregular in form). **This tense indicates either that an action was completed (finished or "perfected") at some point in the past** or that the action extends to the present:\n\n>I have walked two miles already [but I'm still walking].\n\n>**I have run the Boston Marathon [but that was some time ago].**\n\n> The critics have praised the film Saving Private Ryan since it came out [and they continue to do so].\n\nBolding mine.\n\n>TOPIC 3 Accomplishments\n\n>We often use the Present Perfect to list the accomplishments of individuals and humanity. You cannot mention a specific time.\n\n>Examples:\n\n>Man has walked on the Moon.\n\n>Our son has learned how to read.\n\n>Doctors have cured many deadly diseases.\n\n> Scientists have split the atom.
> I don't know of anyone who is poor and on welfare that looks around and says yeahhh this is good I don't need anything else.\n\nHey what's up. Although I'm actually not on welfare (except health care, which was forced on me), I live on roughly 8k a year by choice and don't feel like I need anything else. I used to employ people and pay triple what I make now just in business taxes. I got tired of the government taking half my money, so now I don't employ anybody and pay basically nothing to the state. 
"You forfeit"
That is abundantly clear. 
"But I really REALLY hate the things they say! That makes it ok!"\n\nIt's easy to like the right to free speech when you're agreeing with what's being said. But if you don't stick up for speech you hate, you don't really believe in it at all. 
I spent too much time looking at this thing super confused as to how they let CJ take so many shots from the top of the key in the three-point contest :/
You're just too stoned to see the chaos around you! Obviously you need to be locked up for a year or so, spend time in mandatory reform therapy, and be branded a druggie for the rest of your life! That'll teach you how dangerous drugs are!
Yeah it was offputting for sure. "He's not worth of being an All-star! Look how bad he hits! Oh yeah by the way he's the #1 defensive catcher, but ignore that and let's talk about pitch framing!"
But why not both? :(
We gotta keep those health care costs down somehow.....
The term you're looking for is likely "anchor babies." Basically even though the parents aren't citizens, any child born in the U.S. IS a citizen. So now you have two non-citizens in your country raising a citizen. To break up that family by deporting the parents would be terribly cruel, thus the baby "anchors" the family in the country. 
Queue the ridiculous "Comcast" and "Wal-Mart" arguments......
http://www.businessinsider.com/walmart-closes-hundreds-of-stores-2016-1\n\n> Walmart is closing hundreds of stores and laying off thousands of employees\n\n> Walmart is closing 269 stores and laying off thousands of employees.\n\n>The move will affect more than 16,000 employees, including 10,000 in the US.\n\n>The closings include 154 locations in the US — 102 of which are the company's smallest stores, called Walmart Express, which have been in pilot since 2011.\n\n
> Human nature alone would absolutely devastate a Libertarian idealistic economy.\n\nOn the other hand, libertarians are the only ones who acknowledge human nature and attempt to harness it in the right direction. Government is just as greedy as people, so you can't trust them. They are taking nearly 40% of the income of everybody in the country, and what are they doing with it? Spying on us, bombing campaigns across the world, and building giant fucking walls. It's ridiculous. Get that money back in the hands of Americans who need it.\n\nIf the government were and efficient steward of our tax dollars, I would have no problem with it. As it is we're literally being robbed every day, but we just have to suck it up and take it because they hired the guys who built the roads. 
Oh so /u/swohio was handing out Nazi fliers? Or was he just defending freedom of speech? What about the people who got beat up in Berkeley? Card-carrying Nazis, right?
Although he stated the issue very clearly, here's an excerpt from a NCPA report:\n\n>The primary reason why doctors and hospitals typically do not disclose prices prior to treatment is that they do not compete for patients based on price. Prices are usually paid not by patients themselves but by third parties — employers, insurance companies or government. As a result, patients have little reason to care about prices.\n\n>And it turns out, when providers do not compete on price, they do not compete on quality either. In fact, in a very real sense, doctors and hospitals are not competing for patients at all — at least not in the way normal businesses compete for customers in competitive markets.\n\n>This lack of competition for patients has a profound effect on the quality and cost of health care. Long before a patient enters a doctor’s office, third-party bureaucracies have determined which medical services they will pay for, which ones they will not and how much they will pay. The result is a highly artificial market which departs in many ways from how other markets function. \n\n> In health care markets where third-party payers do not negotiate prices or pay the bills, the behavior of providers is radically different. In the market for cosmetic surgery, for example, patients are offered package prices covering all aspects of care — physician fees, ancillary services, facility costs and so forth. Not only is there price competition, but the real price of cosmetic surgery has actually declined over the past 15 years — despite a six-fold increase in demand and enormous technological change. Similarly, the price of conventional LASIK vision correction surgery (for which patients pay with their own money) has fallen dramatically, even as procedures become more technically advanced. 
>Yeah you kinda do. \n\nThe problem is that SO DO YOU. As the government wrecks the economy with terrible monetary policy, YOU SUFFER AS WELL. When the government spends all our wealth blowing up the Middle East, YOU SUFFER AS WELL. When we lock up our citizens and ruin their lives because of a plan the government continues to lie about, YOU SUFFER AS WELL! \n\nLots of people love to say that the libertarians are the selfish ones, when there are a lot of us who have come at the problem from the exact opposite side. The government IS TERRIBLE AT HELPING PEOPLE. When we give them more money and more power, they use it to enrich the politically connected. \n\n> I know that is hard to swallow for a lot of you but that is the only way any Libertarian policies will ever make the mainstream. Without it you guys will be on the outside being ignored by those on the inside forever and never make any real change.\n\nSooner or later, you will ALSO have a breaking point where you realize that what you are paying for is not equivalent of what you're getting. Just saying that we have to suck up whatever the government dictates because of where you live is crazy to me. People love to come on and talk about the roads and police, but don't realize that the vast vast vast majority of priorities in transitioning America into a libertarian society have nothing to do with this stuff. It's just an easy strawman to argue against while your party continues the war on drugs and handing money over to the banks.
The Nazis were able to take so much power so swiftly because of violent political clashes, often with the far left. \n\n>The Communist Party (KPD) was smaller, but as the largest Communist Party outside the USSR, it was still huge. Writing from exile, Trotsky described the Communists as "the flower of the German proletariat" who were "governed by a sincere and burning aspiration to conquer the fascists, to break the masses away from their influence, to overthrow fascism and to crush it - of this, it is understood, there can be no doubt." And they put their beliefs into practice. During the month of June 1932 alone, Communist street fighting against Nazi brown-shirts left 99 dead and 125 gravely wounded.\n\n
Looking at his other stuff, it's clearly not a joke.
And that line will always stay there forever. With you noble defenders of freedom on one side, and the Nazis on the other. Just like the PATRIOT act will only be used for terrorism and we would never spy on regular citizens!
> a problem i foresee is that you can't just let a house burn down because they don't pay. it could engulf a paying neighbor and cause a whole neighborhood to lite up.\n\nThat's what you said. It's just ironic that the government's solution to this is exactly to let it burn down until the neighbor's property was threatened. Then the fire department showed up and put out the fire. It's still standing policy in many rural areas. \n\n> i believe in the free market but there are some corners that are better payed for by society as whole. you otherwise get people being used and unable to sue in return like the past american health insurance mess.\n\nI fail to see how one thing has anything to do with the other. Can you help me out?
The US military wouldn't be deployed to its full extent in a coup, either. Every piece of infrastructure you take out has to be replaced after the fighting is over. Every time you kill an innocent survived by family, you increase the resistance to your cause. If anything, the military would be even LESS offensive in a civil war type scenario.
Once we get the government to its Constitutional size, THEN we can start bickering with the ancaps about what's left ;)
It's easy to sit and complain that there's no jobs for entry-level positions, but hard to think on the next level and wonder why that is.
It's ironic because the hate speech laws the left so dearly loves will almost certainly be turned on them by an unsympathetic government. 
> What business is going to pay someone to fix a highway?\n\nEvery business that's losing money because of a crappy highway?

The thing is, just like all other essential markets, we don't need to rely on goodwill, we can rely on the market! If prices are drastically cut because we remove the middle men between the people actually doing the work and the patients that pay for it, prices can fall DRAMATICALLY. Making health care less expensive is the best and truest way to increase access to it. \n\nThe first step is market transparency. In what other market could you get away with hiding your prices for your goods? Want that new lawnmower, hope you can afford it! \n\nHere's a clinic that did just that: http://time.com/4649914/why-the-doctor-takes-only-cash/?iid=sr-link1
And thinking only your very favorite protections will be the ones removed, and those removals will never affect your particular brand of political speech is the apex of naivety.

The people do the work anyway. It wasn't democrats that made gay marriage possible, it was the people actually on the ground doing the work through the court system. The democrats just jump into the parade at the very end, then take credit for its organization.

I'd think if those things are so important to you, you'd call your boss to say you're not coming.
Obviously in the context of a UBI discussion, "work" means the time you spend at your job to be financially compensated. 
They got it from FOX, who got it from somebody else throught history, I'm guessing. The important thing is being able to see through the messaging. Didn't you notice how for months there was never any election coverage without mention of the Russian hacking? It inserted itself everywhere. That's how you know there's an angle being pushed.
Yeah I do the same thing, although if the game tightens back up I say "Sorry you're not actually going to win this."
What a save!\n\nWhat a save!
Actually I was waiting for Lemon to make those arguments, because that's the next step in this ever-repeating game of "try to teach people stuff on Reddit." I am in complete agreeance with you that nearly all monopolies are caused by government regulations, and the ones that aren't only survive because they bring superior service and value to the customer.
That's not really correct, no. 
You don't need to struggle with shit. Their ideas are hurtful and awful. If you let them speak people will see that.

Of course they would be concerned with it, there are real political consequences to military actions, especially in the day and age that the whole world is watching.
It doesn't matter. As long as they repeat it long enough, it will become true to the people who don't pay that much attention.
The thing about libertarians is that we're used to losing. It doesn't really bother us because we're just passengers on the U.S.S. Shitshow that's being steered by the two major parties.

This is the correct answer. I'm a gig worker doing freelance stuff from home, and since I've been in complete control of my finances, my expenditures have dropped like a rock.

As somebody who doesn't find his meaning in work, let me tell you where I find it instead: people.\n\nI used to own my own biz and worked 60 hours a week. I thought that it was who I was because I was doing it so often. Many days from morning until night.\n\nWhen I sold that biz, I started working online. My expenditures dropped considerably and suddenly I had loads of "free time" because I didn't have a work schedule to keep and I only had to work 100 hours a month to live comfortably. \n\nSo how do I spend all that time that I'm not working? A big chunk of it goes to volunteering. There are a ton of organizations that need people to do stuff for them, and you get to meet a bunch of great people to boot. Some days I get to play with abandoned kittens. Some days I'm helping build houses or clearing out rotting tree stumps. Sometimes I'm just helping people get food. \n\nI feel like if everybody only had to work 100 hours to get by in life, we'd see a whole lot more compassionate people out there. \n

Most people know that.  And a lot of us are thankful for the risk you take and what you do while working.  It's just that the negative and highly publicized actions of some of your fellow officers is effectively ruining the reputation for all of you.\n\nWhen news comes out what seems like every day about another shooting, or an officer killing a family pet that on video is clearly not aggressive, or using what a reasonable person would consider to be "excessive force" it makes it hard to see anything else. \n\nThe problem, at least in my opinion, is the automatic circling of the wagons when there is wrongdoing.  I understand the need to protect LE, but when the evidence just keeps piling up and there is becoming a clearer and clearer double standard, it makes it difficult for the general public to remain positive.
I thought that i looked funny when i was typing it on my phone. . It's a J.  Can't even do that right. \n

If the argument is, there were no third party candidates and the people who voted for them this time still had to vote for somebody, they would have likely split fairly evenly between the 2 candidates.  By saying "half would have voted for Clinton and half would have just not voted at all" is just an attempt to bias the theoretical results.   \n\nI do agree with you, I would have never voted for clinton.  She did not align even remotely with my political views.  If there was no Johnson my vote would have gone to the constitution party.  If there were no third parties at all I either would have voted (distastefully) for Trump or not at all.
There was.  The ~50% of the population that didn't vote at all.\n

You don't have to deal with the court.  The government would be on your side and he would be dealing with the court.

Oregon is a 2 party recording state which means that both parties have to consent to the recording, UNLESS its over a telecommunication or radio recording.  Which means in short, you can't record if he is just talking (yelling, berating.. etc) to you in person, but if he does it over the phone, you can.

The entire setup costs about 70 bucks but its worth it for what I drink.  also good for carbonating juice, wine, beer and anything else you want.

We had one of those a few weeks ago.  Notice about a student withdrawing complete with name and student id was sent to the entire undergrad, grad and law school.
Came here to ask the same question.  Glad I found that you posted it first otherwise I would be a dirty reposter.
Yes, I've had/am currently having those symptoms.   The shortness of breath and lightheaded feeling especially.   Still trying to find a solution myself. 
Plus, going the eBay route can help you learn and get used to some of of the more interesting parts of warhammer.  Model stripping and reassembly, patching with green stuff and repairs.

Unlike another story I read yesterday about deputies in the same situation, I was impressed ( which is sad to say) with the attentiveness of of the officers here.  They went and got help, they knew when it was beyond their experience.  The medical personal and the company they work for need to face severe liability.  I know they take complaints from inmates with a grain of salt but this is outright negligence at a minimum.
When i'm getting on the freeway and I hear the turbo spinning up i always tell myself "Warp Drive Active"\n
You don't want to go back to cooking.  I sure as hell never want to go back to cooking.  Wait for the rest of your grades to come in, go talk to a counselor, go talk to your teachers and see what happened on the tests.  If you go to a decently ranked school then you are probably not an idiot.  You may have just missed the call of the question.  Law school tests really are nothing like anything else you would have done in undergrad.
Ex ISP tech- \n1) Not from where i was working.  I'm sure one of the network admins could have but they didn't care. \n\n2) No.  I had too many calls to deal with, our network was flakey.\n\n3) We never did.  Generally just tossed the requests.  Because the way the network was setup, unless we really wanted to dig down onto a user's MAC addresses we could not see what was pulling bandwidth.\n\n4) The network monitoring program did it on its own, usually because there was heavy use across that trunk of the network and the speeds needed to be shared with other users.  The only time we would do it manually was if somebody was obviously torrenting non stop and hogging the limited bandwidth on the trunk.\n\n5) Never.  See #3.

Absolutely horrifying, yet still better than looking at Chris Evans.
I had not realized the mistake was quite so expansive.  I mean, if you gotta mess up... do it big.\n
lets see.. for starters i'm fat.  I'm working on that.  But, symptoms include.\nShortness of breath when exerting myself and a lingering minor cough,\nfatigue after eating (like, I'll almost fall asleep in class), wicked heartburn if I eat carbs or don't take my omeprazol.  muscle cramps.  Tightness in my chest if I eat too close to going to bed.  bowel issues if I eat grain.  I drink a ton of soda water and that seems to help the indigestion during the day, so I wonder if my fatigue is a result of being low on salts but it could also be stress (law student)\n\nI've been to the Dr and and EKG done, nothing wrong there.  My ankles swell when I drink, but he says that's just because i'm fat.    \n\nI try really hard to stick to a low carb diet because that seems to help everything the most.
All true, I do love the his reviews, I think I've seen every one.  Re watching that one really showed how far he has come too.
So, obviously you followed keto.. But could you give some examples of your meals starting compared to now?  I'm pretty much at the same starting point you are and want to be at that end point.
I was in your same position of not understanding why people cared so much about sneakers.  Buzzfeed did a video comparing different sneakers at different costs. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwSW848TNPo  I still don't understand it  but the video was mildly amusing at least.
While I dont have trouble burping very often, i do generally feel the need to burp after i eat or just a random times if my stomach is angry for some reason.  I've found that keeping some plain soda water around is super handy, because it helps you stay hydrated and it kinda forces a burp to relax the muscles.  I'll drink a bunch of water, do a little burp from the carbonation then a few seconds later a much deeper feeling one now that the path has been opened.\n\nI used to hate soda water, now i go through about 10L a week.
Good work gw.  License this great game for a world you blew up.

Because this is how I wanted to spend the first Saturday of my break.  But that's ok. Just as long as I don't spend the rest of my break volunteering at a judges campaign for the admittedly express purpose of garnering favor that I can brag about to a future employer as if the judge "owed me one"
If it's your event, ask the caterer or whoever is providing food to have keto friendly snacks around.  broccoli and ranch, bacon, parmesan crisps, pork rinds, mixed nuts, cheese..etc
meat, cheese, greens, proteins, fats, some fruits, berries, nuts, eggs.
Yea.  As much as I want to have a hive to make mead... I would stung like crazy.  Stupid racist bees.\n
I took one class over summer just to get money to survive.
I'm at a very left leaning campus in the northwest.  While professors do commonly show bias towards one side, the worst of it comes from the students. Being conservative is something of a bad word and we have had members of the sba get called racist because they wouldn't break the rules for special interest groups.  The professors try to stay neutral during classes but have been known to blatantly show bias at times.
That's a good question. If you have a bar supply store or industrial supply store, or even homebrewing store they may supply co2.  This is the size tank that I have at home [C02 Tank](https://www.homebrewsupply.com/aluminum-co2-cylinder-5lb.html?gclid=Cj0KEQiAvNrBBRDe3IOwzLn6_O4BEiQAmbK-DoruMlCafwFczCGBAHN3VUF1VDQ9WKHgzryRqJQBX5saAhX08P8HAQ) and it has lasted me 4 months and 4 pony kegs of beer without having to be refilled.  In the US you can order those tanks empty and just take them to be filled, not sure about there.
I just read the wolfrik book and enjoyed it.  I may recommend the gotrek and Felix books, or the witch Hunter set as well (although I have not read them so.. Your mileage may vary)

you are making me thirsty.  Where did you get your keg and do you recommend kegging any other fermentables? 
I actually buy sweets very very rarely.  I just said Costco because I needed a few hundred cookies for an event on campus and for their price they were good.  Otherwise, I'll just make my own.

It seems to help some, but only in getting rid of the heartburn aspect of everything.  The headache, dizziness and chest tightness is not helped at all.
It's a bit of a trick I noticed in his class.  If Trump suggests something or states that the statute be interpreted a certain way, the answer is clearly the opposite.
I have not been anywhere that would have deer ticks.  I was thinking it was more along the lines of low blood sugar.  The strange thing is, it really only happens with lunch and dinner.  Breakfast (sausage & eggs) does not phase me.\n

That really is true.  I tend to equate the election solely to the presidential one.  It would be interesting to see how many people voted for everything else but president.
Not unless I'm being active.  But i've always chocked that up as me being a fatass.
Yea, i'm at a loss as to what really is causing the problems.  I know the GERD is causing the heartburn and such that I get but the sleepiness and fatigue is confusing.

I didn't think the town hall was bad.  They were on message. Weld was better than Johnson by far on addressing the issues which I thought was interesting, but I don't discount him for his answers.  Being in CNN can be a bit of a shock and its something he needs to come to terms with.  I did hate that stupid heroin question though.  Talk about loaded, at the same time, he should have been on notice that such a question might arise.
As the title says, sorry for the quality, it was a cell phone of a TV screen.  I don't recall seeing this particular drawing in the house other than in the finale, but I could be wrong.  Any thought as to what it may be, or if anybody has access to a clearer shot of it?

My business associations professor uses Family Guy characters in all of his lectures and actors/athletes in his tests.  Also, a surprisingly large amount of Trump.  It really helps the narrative of the problems to not just have "Person X", but a name that you automatically associate a face and voice to.
I saw there was a rerun of one of the new episodes on a couple of days ago. I really really tried to watch it.  Parts with sabine driving were great, the car was great, but as soon as Chris Evans got on the screen I just couldn't do it anymore.
The fountainhead was a book I really enjoyed.
When I say they circle the wagons I'm referring to the police unions, prosecutors and investigators that turn a blind eye to actions taken by overly aggressive or outright criminal actions done by some officers.  This is a big a problem as the media rallying against the police or the constant echo chamber of forums and groups like reddit.\n\nI agree that there needs to be more done about finding out why more of these incidents are happening, or, if the same amount are happening and we are just hearing about it more due to a wider availability of recording devices and surveillance.\n\nI think the problem is, for so long in some communities, the police have been the bad guy.  In some cases this is justified but in others it's just stereotyped.  All of this needs to be handled before any change can be made.  Otherwise police will continue to get more militarized, which in some circumstances is fine, as the criminals are as well, and the public opinion of them will continue to decline.  \n\nBoth sides have to come to the table here.  It won't work if it's just groups like Black Lives matter screaming their heads off and police unions denying and refusing to investigate.\n\nEdit- about the tough on crime laws, I meant to address that.  \n\nI agree, criminal laws should reflect criminal acts that directly harm others.  Moral crimes like drug use should be taken off of the books. This alone would save a crazy amount of money which could be then put into things like education.  The problems is, the unions and prison complex want to keep jails full, so that won't happen.  The more things that are criminal, the more officers you need and the more prisons are required.\n
I have an alternate theory about the "guys not wearing pants" thing.  They ARE wearing pants, but they are made from the same "fabric" as the curtains and against all fashion sense are tucked into their shoes.

Still working my way through Uranus. Is that a boss?
Yeah downvote him because he's right lol. I'm sorry but if this game still has you playing every day after all this time you probably have an addiction.
This is a nice piece of repost. *Sigh*\nBut repost nonetheless.
Just the fact that they would fire someone that expresses that amount of concern on a site that isn't moderated by nexon is sad. You have no idea how much respect was gained in the community seeing one guy post about it that had the power to do something.\n\nHey nexon, if people are bringing their problems to a different site and getting heard, that just shows how fucking shitty your own site is at getting real problems recognized and true solutions facilitated.\n\nGuaranteed word on reddit goes way farther than your bs coded website.
I read this, agreed completely with everything cause that's how I would do it, but then wonder why the fuck I'm not a supervisor.
Strange sorry but maybe it's relatable. \n\nWhen I was little I used to have trouble. When I had dreams they would get terrifying and always strange, and it was hard for me to find a reason to close my eyes. \n\nI started to try imagining the most peaceful sleep like state of being you could be in. Strange enough what ended up helping was imagining what it was like floating in the sacred realm of the Legend of Zelda video games. I tried focusing all my senses away from everything going on around me and in my head to a pure white floating/falling existence, and try to focus harder and harder until everything else seemed to melt away and I'd kind of trance out. And usually I'd go just a little deeper and fall asleep after that.
Gee...I'm glad your reading comprehension and logic skills are top notch so I can post this.

But it's a little too late for that.
Yeah let's make some rich mother fucker richer for more delicious pixels that they could just make more accessible. \n\nBut I guess if you have literal money you can throw away, then having to pay someone to give you a digital pat on the back is the least of your worries.\n\nKeep throwing away money, cause eventually com2us will throw away this game.

Oh for sure I get that. \n\nBut everyone doesn't apply to the people on the same biased reddit politics post reading the same biased tldr summaries quoting the same biased excerpts.\n\nNot saying I'm unbiased but certainly not biased towards Trump.\n\nJust saying I could make jesus sound like a piece of shit if I quoted the right parts of passages in the right order.\n\nNonetheless we shall see because if this thread is right and everything is in context, Trump is going to get charged or reamed by our government.\n\nAnd if not, we find that Reddit logic + tldr × upvotes does not always equal truth, and people need to realize that on here or we become another tool to be manipulated.

Fulfillment is based on personal protective I suppose, but it doesn't change the fact if your enjoyment and happiness comes from a game that this much planning and not so much as much work goes into, as an ex video game addict is really sad.\n\nLong lasting as in meaning something you can share, talk about with others, reminisce in the future when your old. I'm sorry to say but summoner wars is not one of those games I'll enjoy talking about, especially since I'm watching history repeat itself. I don't even like talking about MS because the direction they went and that took up way more time and energy. It is not WOW and nowhere close to maplestory, and the only enjoyment I really get is a well balanced auto and a great pull (which I can't say I've experienced in a long time). I personally wouldn't even consider sports more than a distraction. My entertainment usually incorporates something enlightening one way or another, but that might just be personal opinion.\n\nInvestment means you get a return. Movies and shows you learn about plot elements and get fantastic sound and video quality in theatres, collection hobbies you have something physical to show off, baseball games are at least an experience. What do you take away from summoner wars? When those servers shut down, do you get a fraction back of what was stuffed in their pockets? \n\nWhy would they tell us about that? Might as well put a flyer on their game page "remember, we plan to make this game harder and harder for the free new player to get ahead, so keep on trying out freemium game." Worst business pitch ever. But if you didn't notice the trend, light dark scrolls in the store last year, 5 start scrolls in the store this year. What is the next move, 7 star announcement after that? Then rinse and repeat till game dies. That last part is speculation yes, but not because I haven't seen this all before.\n\nSeriously, there were white knights every time trying to defend maplestory, and it didn't stop the player base from degrading to shit.\n\nI'm not worried about this game, I know anything with this business scheme is set up to crash inevitably. What I am worried about is what developers think they can get away with, and how it's effecting games with a 60 dollar price tag in ways we are just beginning to see.

Push it farther and farther until people can't even legally say no or B. Enough people take a stand against it that it does down.\n\nI'd say paying for 3x the data for just some text info you did want + 10 on screen ads is pretty damn ridiculous.

Summoner wars' is something only relevant as long as the game stays relevant to people and the company, and when either goes under your investment becomes inevitable trash once the server's shut down.\n\nAnd adding higher extents of pay 2 win means cheapening the game for anyone more casual than people blowing 100s a month on this game, which is not that many. \n\nI've seen this ruin so many games PC and Mobile. Maplestory was one of them.\n\nDownvote all you want, won't change reality bud.
tbh i think them releasing reboot, for me the best thing thats ever happened to the game as a true free player, but for everyone thats played continually over the years a game ruiner.\nIt's clear at this point they want to suck every new player in that they can, and not give a fuck about the people spending years and years.

As the page goes "give to Caesar what is Caesar's, but give to God what is God's."\nWhich simply put means the government will govern, and we should do what we can to appease our governments requirements as people but still do or Christian duties. It keeps the two out of the way of each other pretty well, and almost gives you enough room to be selfish about it.\n\nReaching out to others on a person to person level is another duty we have, yes, but not to the liberal Robin Hood take from the plenty give to the poor extent. We do food, clothing  and toy drives and fundraisers within the church community, but I get the feeling we don't support lots of these programs because it leaves too much room for people to misuse good will and enable them to not improve their lives. This sounds unrealistic I know, but evangelicals think a lot of these problems that people who might need these programs have can be more or less solved if they were part of a Christian community/lifestyle.\n\nNow that I'm writing this I'm thinking that just might be part of the whole conservative spin. Up till now the only real religious reason I could see my parents being conservative was for there stance on being anti-abortion.\n\nBut maybe the whole reason Christians gravitate towards Republicans is that if we don't help the poor and unfortunate, they will eventually run out of options and end up being another of the reasons "we need Jesus", or they give up and find god.

Tbh coming from a true blue straight out the book Lutheran, it seems like there are more Lutheran and Protestant churches willing to bend the rules, and the more people that are okay with this alterations on the teachings, the less Protestants will have that negative view towards Catholics personal additions to the rules.
I think you might be correct. You'd think they would incorporate the two together somehow but that sounds way above nexons paygrade
Thanks for being civil. I'll definitely keep that viewpoint in mind. And as a Protestant raised kid it really does take all the little incongruencies from what the Bible says and demonizes it. Idk if you ever seen that Luther movie made in the last 20 or so years, a lot of the older and some of the younger still view Catholicism that way, in contempt.\nThat tiny seed of corruption has been growing in their minds since then, although I believe they have come a long way since then, and doubt it could be any worse than the sect I belong to in scale.\n\nEdit: sorry could you explain just a little what you mean by church came first, like it's framework is at the base the NT, but with the churches personal direction over that?
Not talking shit, but Catholics aknowledge lots of things though that the Bible doesn't say really at all.\nIt contributes to why they have the highest amount of converts in and out. Some things appeal to those on the outside, but once you get in people notice how strange it can be with comparison.

Those are great!  They'll catch fish for sure!  You might tie a few in chartruse as well.  As Lefty says "If it ain't chartruse, it ain't no use!"  Don't be afraid to tie them even more sparsely as well.
I like it!  Any particular reason you decided to change the body color to clear?
I could not agree more with /u/foxbellyrubs I will emphasize the glasses issue.  A couple years ago, fishing with my dad, he was seeing things that I wasn't (me 32, he 60).  On the same trip, our guide kept pointing out fish he was seeing in the water which I could not see while pointed them out to me.  Upon return, I bit the bullet on a pair of, way too expensive, Costa prescription sunglasses.  Let me tell you, it changed everything for me.  I have a hard time putting the difference into words.  \n\nChanging glasses made a huge difference fishing double dry tricos on the Bighorn this summer.  My #18 dun stood out brightly, and my #22, or #24 spinner were generally visible too.\n\nAll of this with the caveat that when light is tough, light is tough.  No getting around partial cloud and shade right at dawn with fancy glasses.
This sounds like fun, PM me for my email address and personal details, I'd love to help.
If I knew it was that kind of party I wouldn't have put my Glock in the mashed potatoes!
Glad you enjoyed it!  If you're new to it, that podcast is a HUGE wealth of knowledge.  Basically, pick any topic surrounding fly fishing or tying, and there is an episode with a big name expert on it.  I notably liked Pat Dorsey's interview on "Colorado Guide Flies" and Steve Galletta's interview on the Bighorn River.  A great way to make a long drive go by quickly\n
And if I find out it's not coffee, as suggested by the other comments in this thread, and instead a nice single malt l, I'd love to send a bottle of it your way as a thank you for the knowledge you have passed along.

Careful with this. If it tastes sweet it is generally not dry.  Look for sparkling wines labeled "brut" as a generally safe category.  Avoid "sec" (sweet) or "Demi-sec" (semi sweet) as they contain residual sugar after the fermenting is done.
A nice morning brown caught on the Bighorn in MT on a trico spinner a few weeks ago.
Foiled by the disguise I use myself!  Doh!

Check out kelly Galloup's interview regarding "fishing streamers for trophy trout" on the ask about fly fishing podcast (available on their website).  He states that a trout will eat things up to half their body length!  He also talks about testing out a huge streamer and having a little pint size trout come up, try to eat it and then try from a different angle when he realized he couldn't get it in his mouth!
Excellent!  Where do you fish out of when you're on the delta?
Saw /u/timcammisa tying these on his YouTube channel last week and was compelled to pick up some the crazy dubbing from fly tyer's dungeon.  Thanks Tim for all of your videos!  They have been extremely helpful and educational.  Now finally, please have a sip of your coffee!  :)
This is awesome, do you do commissioned work?  
I've done 5 Takagis myself out in California and plan to continue to use them.  5 years in on the oldest with zero issues post installation (had 1 bad unit on one install).
Oh, excellent!  I'm guessing I punched that card this trip a couple times.  Not with this particular guy though, I think he was about 18".  Fished a lot of size 22 trico spinners and duns in the mornings 
I agree with /u/jim002 don't mess with a slow drop in carbs, drop to your full bottom, deal with a bit of sluggishness for a day or two and enjoy.  You're not coming from a huge carb load diet, transition should be relatively easy.
Have you fished Elkhairs with bright wings like this before?  Are they as effective as natural/bleached Elk?  I would love to tie some of these up for my dad (who is having a harder time seeing the flies on the water) if they have proven effective.  I've already started tying my parachutes with bright paraposts, and even mayfly attractors like Royal Wulffs with pink or orange wings, interested to see how much further it can be taken! 
Looks like a galloup's circus peanut, but with a fish skull mask.  There are tutorials on YouTube.  A notably good one is by flyfishingtheozarks

G29SF is good to go.  I have one with essentially the same uses as you.  Carry it as a sidearm pig hunting and every now and again as ccw in the winter.  The surefire xc-1 fits it well, and Dara makes a nice holder to accommodate both.  If you keep the stock barrel (I have) I would avoid the high grain 10mm rounds.  No problem with the Doubletap DT hunter 180gr JHP or the Barnes vortex 155gr tac-xp hollow point all copper rounds (we have laws against lead in a lot of places I hunt in California).
I see now, you might ask /u/mac102250 what he uses, sounds like he ties them on jig hooks
Good point
Composition speaks to how the subject sits in the frame.  In this photo, what /u/Norass411 is presumably speaking to includes a couple of things I can pick out:  1:  The mag extension is cut off out of the frame, while there is blank space in front of the muzzle.  2: The firearm is placed at an unfamiliar angle that makes it difficult to recognize and appreciate the modifications.
He was holding and waiving, along with a bunch of other people, one of those huge flags that covers an entire stadium field.
I did this in Northern California once.  Never have I felt more like a shark lure than that night.  Rode 2 waved and noped the fuck out.   It's incredibly eerie in person as the colors almost look like your eyes are just playing a trick on you, and might not really be there.
Yup, listen to /u/brinegarnator 
I have one.  It is not as easy as other mounts to align your reticle, as that you are only tightening one side of the mount, so you have to orient your scope at a slight angle and then tighten the rings.  Additionally, for a rife that takes a beating, I don't like the hinged top.  Very thin metal compared to say the PEPR, if you google, there are lots of folks who have broken the hinge (maybe or maybe not due to user error and over tightening).  I have mine on a light use varmint gun and I presume it will work just fine, but if I had to do it again, I would purchase something else.
I love it!  Have you fished similar patterns before(non sculpted wine cork head)?  Effective?
Good Dog!!!!  Chicken for dinner tonight!
Funny, I thought the same thing.  Howdy neighbor.
+1 to this.  As I have tried different belts, I find myself reaching for the stiffest of the bunch every time, makes everything more comfortable.  I have a Hanks, it is just fine, looks nice, works fine.  But I wear my DSG Arms reinforced belts far more often as they are lower profile under a shirt and stiffer.  The stiffness really makes the belt stay in place, no sagging.
Good work, I'm sure he's proud!
That's cool looking, but wouldn't it be better served to be put on a short slide gun?  One that doesn't have the advantage of the long sight radius like your long slide has?
Isn't this too low in fat?  Add some olive oil?
Ahhh... I didn't even notice that.  What is the difference, and how detrimental is it?
Same here.  I've gone through about 500 of their 10mm, many many more in other calibers with great results.
Yup, and only a few years back, it was something like $8 for a 5-pack.
Beautiful!  Can you tell me, in person does the Aero FDE match the Magpul FDE?  Looks good on screen, but of course that can be deceiving.
Seems better than waiting a whole week and then 2 hours between match times! 
Looks good!  As /u/BigREDafro mentioned, you might try to dub it a bit more sparsely, notably back by the tail, with a taper up to the parachute post.  I'm sure the fish'll eat it though!
Not to mention +3 Oper9er status!  :)
Oh, no?  Here in CA they can be quite tasty.  Assuming you get them at a relatively good time of year.  If nothing else, tasty sausage.\n
I only need to meet the dumb ones!  \n\nYour San Juan worm example is one that often makes me wonder while tying more difficult flies "AM I wayyyy over thinking this?"
I'm in!  Planning on some foam frogs
That's the hope!  Much like you I typically fish clousers in about the same size.  I recently got excited about articulated streamers and am hoping the hogs might like something a bit bigger!
I did that with some yellow on top of my rusty spinners like Tim Cammissa did in his hi-vis rusty spinner video, but unfortunately it was little help at normal fishing distances.  Looked great in the vise though.\n\nThanks for the idea!

As I understand it (Not a lawyer), you are free to take and shoot your AR.  The law went into effect as of Jan 1, 2017, however enforcement is suspended until Jan 1, 2018.  In other words it is "illegal" but officially unenforced. 
Of course that's a thing!
I don't tie on jig hooks as of yet.  My go to salt hooks are Dai-Riki 930s or the equivalent tiemco (I forget the number) and tiemco 8089NP.
I had them on a few of my pistols.  I like the extra tackiness of the grip, really gives a solid feel in the hand.  Unfortunately, I ran into a problem with them during a training on a hot summer day.  The grip itself got so warm that the glue began to separate from the frame of the gun.  For that reason, I decided to take them off and stipple instead.  I still miss the rubbery texture, but to me it wasn't worth the potential problems, at least on carry guns.
It is slower than a standard mag release.  It looks basically like a standard release with a hole in the middle of it.  You must insert a tool into the hole to depress the mag release.  The tool, in the case of a bullet button, can be a round of .223/5.56.  Other tools that could be used include a small screwdriver, allen wrench, etc.  \n\nIn no way is it as described by the author.  It circumvents a law in the state that requires a tool to remove a magazine.

"Power behind the throne" is the best one.\n\nCryptocracy and Shadow Governments is secretly where the "real power" is held by those who are completely unknown to the subject and little power by the "puppets". \n\nA cabal is a group of people where the people with "real power" are known but is vastly understated because the relationship of the power structures are obscured when working secretly in concert. \n\nAgents and Principles in the principal–agent problem, I don't think there is any need for secrecy. \n\nI think we are entering a sort of paradox. OP describes a situation where middlemen could have the most power within a hierarchy. A hierarchy a system or organization in which people or groups are ranked one above the other according to status or authority. I have a tough time imagining a hierarchy where the middlemen are publicly known to have the most power. I'd say that you have the hierarchy wrong and the "king" is just a figurehead. In the situation of Queen Elizabeth II, I think we would label it by the lack of power by the queen rather than abundance of power by the middlemen. I know OP said "Don’t assume a chain of command or hierarchy." but I think it would have to be from the lack of hierarchy. \n\nI don't really think of Gatekeepers, in the literal sense, as the middleman between new comers and the inner crowd. I sort of see it.

Your example is modifies the rate of which you make money. \n\nrate\\*hours\\*(1-tax) = money\n\nSure, increasing the rate and the tax will increase the amount of money that you will make for the same number of hours. But the suggestion is to raise taxes without increasing the rate. Meaning that they will have to work more hours to get the same pay previous to the tax increases.\n\nWhen you change the value of an investment (hours worked etc), you change the opportunity costs and expected value of that investment. \n\nA simple way to look at it is, I would fix a computer for $30/hour in my free time but I would not do it for $5/hour even though it nets me money. At a rate of $5/hour, I would rather relax and play hearthstone. \n\n"Well, its 9 months into the fiscal year and I reached the limit my tax bracket and each dollar will be taxed an additional X% than my previous dollars. At that rate, I'd rather just play golf for the rest of the year."

I don't think he is really pushing his position. His questions ask why isn't this universal and where is the line. I think Hasan asks where the line is 3 different times and I don't think we got great answers. I know we can come up with great Zizek type answer but I think Zizek did.
We are talking about government granted licenses.

> Big companies can price out small start ups, and it's mutually beneficial to not compete.\n\nI don't think that is a sustainable business practice to always buyout your competition.  \n\nIf you thought Obamacare was going to stick it to those "greedy insurance companies", look up the stock prices: NYSE: ANTM, NYSE: UNH, NYSE: AET. These are 1st, 3rd and 4th largest companies and they posted record profits in the last 2 years (2nd is KAISER FOUNDATION and that is privately held).\n\nIn the trucking industry, there is regulations to require truckers to use electronic logs called the elog mandate. Like 85+% of the Trucking Carriers in the US are 5 or less people and its pretty competitive (Small companies are cheaper). Less than 10% of the trucking companies have the resources and the tech to have GPS/Tracking recording software. The companies lobbying for elog mandate are the ones that already have it. The advantages are two fold: Companies get more drivers and Major companies have less competition. This is being pushed into the congress for safety reasons. \n\nI'd be interested to see which companies you identity as bad, long lasting monopolies and exists with relatively low government assistance? \n\n1. Anheuser-Busch: Wins by keeping pot illegal and ATF regulations\n2. Anthem: Benefits from Obamacare\n3. Intel: Makes good product that requires heavy long term investment\n4. Pearson: Sells to Government(s)\n5. Tyson: Billions in subsidies. [However you could probably argue this either way](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9wHzt6gBgI)\n6. Luxottica(Designer Glasses): Sells status symbols (?) Probably no regulation issues\n7. De Beers: [Milton Friedman notes this as 1 of 2 exceptions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdLBzfFGFQU)\n8. YKK Group (Zippers): Zippers are pretty dirt cheap\n9. Sirius XM: Piggy Backs off the auto-industry which is pretty non-competitive
Middlemen - 1. a person who arranges business or political deals between other people. 2. a person who buys goods from producers and sells them to retailers or consumers.\n\nI don't see ruling in this definition. But I think the middle man in this example has more leverage than the "producers" and "consumers". Like Walmart has more "power" than its individual customers and diary farmers.

Clearly it is true! Didn't you see that guy had like 30 upvotes?\n\n> increasingly irrelevant \n\nProbably true. If Zizek's theory's were true, ideology would be increasingly difficult to notice - giving the appearance that it does not exist, thus increasing irrelevancy. The same would be true if ideology was actually disappearing.  \n\n> inevitable descent into mediocrity \n\nSome of the best performers have tainted their legacy by trying to continue to produce hits.  \n\n> often contradictory\n\nBread\n\n> contrarian statements\n\nButter\n\n> to make a headline, get a book deal, secure a speaking slot \n\nHe would do anything for a coca-cola. Honestly, Zizek says the same things over and over again but in different combinations. He certainly isn't saying anything new or unexpected. My guess is that his coverage this year was two-fold: The right enjoying a leftist who seemed like  he agrees with their anti-PC language and preference of Trump and the validation of Zizek's work describing the nature of social change. \n\n>Castro is a giant and will be for decades to come. \n\n<joking>Not to say that this sub-reddit isn't filled with white males, but the those who praise Castro are normally of the euro-masculine variety~ So probably correct because white men write history.</joking>\n\n>Zizek will be forgotten before he leaves us\n\nHe would have wanted it that way. Not to die but to be removed where there is no evidence of existence ;)\n\nLet's be real, /r/communism fell in love with Zizek for re-popularizing the "Communist" label and being critical (and being "relevant" during the Occupy protests). Then Zizek started getting coverage for the non-economic commentary this last election cycle. Zizek said some not very leftist things and that made them very angry. Then when they found more about Zizek, they became disinterested. \n\n
See, little benefit to you, pain to us~ \n\nI am being melodramatic. I was just disappointed it wasn't a promotional app ("actually from Big Head"). Looks like a side good project though! 
I think its too dogmatic (and simple) for us to discredit and call people idiots who "don't get Zizek" if they criticize him. "If you have an issue with Zizek, then you haven't thought about it very hard." Many of Zizek's ideas are pretty esoteric and laden with jargon but this is on a very accessible topic and it shouldn't require a high level of nuance. I think we in this sub-reddit share in Zizek's worldview, unstated assumptions and nuanced analysis but we can't be overly upset when someone questions them. I think it becomes extra problematic when the answers don't convey this. \n\nIts not a strawman. He isn't rephrasing Zizek incorrectly and THEN refuting it. Also, Is it really a strawman when Zizek replies with "Why is that problematic?"? Rephrasing an argument to your "opponent" offers them a chance to correct it or dispute it. He also quotes Zizek directly more than once.\n\nZizek says "You under-estimate this" and Hasan says "Maybe you over-estimate this". Zizek doesn't convince me that Hasan is under estimating this. \n\nHasan talks about "There isn't a unified group of Muslims and there isn't a unified group of Europeans". Zizek says "That's too simple" and I think Hasan makes thoughtful points/questions. We here at /r/zizek know how to answer these questions but I was more commenting on Zizeks response. \n\nAt 5:05, Hasan asks what is that minimum of Western notions of western ideals that refugees do not meet.  Zizek responds with "Personal freedom and Personal Choice" and those are pretty vague answers.\n\nAt 5:30, Hasan asks about the rhetoric of the far right. We talked about this all year in this sub-reddit about how "Zizek is not a hero of the alt-right" and how it is not an easy thing to explain to them.\n\nAt 5:50, Zizek claims that he isn't trying to be provocative. I'm skeptical of that one. \n\nReal criticism doesn't mean Zizek is wrong. His arguments have the appearance hasty generalized and they should be addressed.  It doesn't mean they are but I think Zizek does a poor job defending himself in this regard. \n\nThe issue with Zizek interviews is he goes on tangents and never really answers the question if you let him.

It wouldn't be so bad but he put ads on his app. One of own, put ads in an app!
I think this is because Zizek is very broad in his works that specific parts of theory will only interest a small fraction of this subreddit. While everybody here is familiar with his mannerisms. 
If no secrecy and no one "ranks" above oligarchs, I think this wouldn't fit your definition.
For Penn, its about creating a bloodthirsty audience who only want to see people face actual danger. Risking danger might be fine as an means to an end for a football player but he wants to avoid "gladiatorial games" entertainment by artists where violence/danger/risk is the end goal.

>I don't get why they think deregulation is a good thing. It hasn't worked in the past. \n\nI am a  classical liberal and I am a fan of deregulation. I think regulation should be simple, understandable, minimal and universal. Regulations should be consistent/predictable so that people can make long term investments and not worry about risk regulatory action. \n\nI think the regulation and deregulation have been pretty bad for the US. Even though I am a fan of deregulation, I am skeptical when Republicans want to deregulate something. [I also fear Regulatory capture.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulatory_capture) This is my view of the words of their use in practice:\n\n**Regulation**: I'm going to make one company's practices the standard thus making it more difficult for their competitors to meet regulatory compliance. \n\n**Deregulation**: I eliminated the competition for a company (cartel) and I am removing barriers that prevent maximal profit and its a low risk that this deregulation will add competition to the market.\n\nHere's my proposal: If you want to get rid of Net-Neutrality, deregulate the industry as a whole. \n\n>Which is a bullshit rhetoric when most people live with regional monopolies or oligopolies.\n\nThis is a point of contention: the reason monopolies exist and the gauging if an industry is over or under regulated. I think Cable companies have regional monopolies exist because of government regulation and subsidy.\n\nIf you think that an industry is not very regulated and there is a monopoly,  then it would seem absurd that government would be to blame because it exists without it.\n\nIf you think that an industry is too regulated and there is a monopoly, then it would seem reasonable that the government is fault.\n\nIn this video, Saul Levmore talks about the government not only creating monopolies but why it likes them: [Saul Levmore: Monopolies as an Introduction to Economics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FK2qHyF-8u8)
Isn't Zizek's point more of "When you buy things, you are buying an ideological experience".\n\nHelp me out here /r/zizek, what would zizek say: Something something Lacan says to strive for ideals and ideas (which would be perfect and unattainable) and avoid buying things because once you obtain those things, desire goes away and the horror of the real sets in?   
The language is slightly decisive but it is in the form of a question which makes it less problematic for me. \n\nHasan thinks that the refugees situation isn't different or different enough to draw special criticism nor should it be universal for the different parts of europe. For example, Zizek (for a lack of a better word) complains about the refugees are incompatible with Euro culture. For Hasan, simplying it to just euro-culture seems too very abstract to make sense because there is great diversity within Europe. \n\nLet's say culture fit on a number scale - Germany: 1, England 2, Poland: 3, Syria: 8. The difference between Germany and England is off by 100%. Seems pretty different when compared to each other and even more so when compared to Poland. But when all three are compared to Syria, that is really different. Zizek says 7 is too different but 2 is about the same. Hasan is asking why is 2 ok but not 7. I think that should be addressed but it wasn't yet I think it addressable.

La La Land is a truly perverted movie. That is it is about a couple that each foregoes their metaphorical "reproductive finality" in order to become each others perceived object of desire. I was not enjoying myself for the first 45 minutes as the characters really gave me no reason to care and the musical numbers were pretty forgettable. But when it redeemed itself at the climax, I was chanting "Please don't have a happy ending" and thought this was a Zizek Goldmine as it is filled with desire, class and reversals. \n\nI think it is an interesting take of "The Gift of the Magi". In the beginning, Emma stone's character, Mia, is the "Keep your day job" pragmatist while Gosling's Character, Sebastian, is the "uncompromising and idealistic" traditionalist. They fall in love with each other, I claim, for being passionate opposites.\n\nSebastian over hears Mia's conversation with her mother and realizes that he is incomplete in Mia's eyes (He is a FUTURE club owner and a FUTURE famous musician). Sebastian forgoes his "Jazz purism" and sells out in order to be complete in Mia's eyes. Mia makes a similar reversal, under the suggestion by Sebastian to live her childhood dream, by quitting her day job to make time for her idealistic one-woman showed. The lovers essentially trade places. \n\nThe couple wanted each other to be successful but they didn't realize that they couldn't formulate how their desires would work in reality. They force themselves to be unhappy so that the other could realize how the other sees their potential. When the achieve their shared fantasies, they realize it is immediately lost. "I thought you wanted this" is something that could have been plausibly been said from either lover.  \n\nSo like the "The Gift of the Magi", they sacrifice their "essential" desires to help fulfill their partners desires and ultimately negating each other however La La Land does not give us the cheap, happy "mutually appreciative" lesson in love. The two former lovers "trade" places once again - reverting back to their old ways but post-success.\n\n\n

Hatchet job? I loved it. This is 2nd favorite interview since the BBC one. At first, I was a little bothered but I thought it about it more and I think Hasan does a great job point out the holes (not flaws but unadressed parts of the picture). I think it will be too easy for this sub-reddit to say things like "Hasan doesn't understand" or that he is mis-representing him.\n\nZizek is being challenged. He is getting is real criticisms and in that destructive space, we see a new part of Zizek. Honestly? Zizek didn't do a great job of defending himself. Zizek even questioned himself on the phrasing of his own book. \n\nZizek relies on his friends anecdotes ("My friends from Germany told me..."). In one hand Zizek is getting grilled for using too broad of strokes, paradox of the heap for attributing problems to a group of Europeans vs a group of refugees yet Zizek often asks us to look at his words precisely. Hasan is asking for Zizek to draw some lines and Zizek doesn't do a great job making the distinction.\n\nI know his positions are more defensible but in the video, there was much more to be desired in this regard. 
Post-modernism is tricky to define as it been used to describe many things by many different people. [It has been suggested that the term "postmodernism" is a mere buzzword that means nothing.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_postmodernism)  /u/Ciax420 gives the technically correct answer but then it I don't think it is helpful in understanding. "Simulacra and Simulation" by Baudrillard is the best start.\n\nThe post-modern father is more about Totalitarianism is a post-modern, permissive society. Its not enough that you do what you are supposed to do, but you must feel a certain way about it. You live in a society where you can pretty much do what you want to do and everyone believes this to be true. So your actions represent what you "really" want to do or who you really are. Those actions are symbolic or representative of something of real. \n\nTo me on an overly simplified level, it describes a society that put the cart before the horse and motorizes the cart to drag the horse. A society that forget the "telos" (an end or purpose) of objects or actions sometimes in the form of vestigial cultural practices.  Not 100% accurate but just to help get you in the right way to think about this: Modernism = "Art imitates life", PostModernism = "Life imitates art". [This is not a pipe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Treachery_of_Images) but a representation of one (Our current use of language creates these ambiguities). \n\nI think giving examples might help here (and I might be wrong here so feel free to correct):\n\n1. In "Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?", Robots (a simulated person) raise robotic farm animals. Traditionally, real people used to raise farm animals to feed their families. What purpose would a robotic farm animal have to a real person if it cannot provide food? What purpose would a robotic farm animal have to a robot does not need to eat?\n2. Postmodern Jukebox is a band. A Jukebox is a simulation of various bands singing and playing instruments. Jukeboxes were most popular from the 1940s through the mid-1960s and are a symbol of classic and vintage music. Postmodern Jukebox is known for reworking popular modern music into different vintage genres, especially early 20th century forms such as swing and jazz. Postmodern Jukebox is a band that simulates something that simulates a band. \n3. In James Bond film, Spectre, the opening sequence featured a Day of the Dead parade in Mexico City - at the time of first playing, this misrepresented Mexican culture. A year later, [Mexico City celebrates its first ever Day of the Dead parade.](https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2016/oct/30/mexico-city-celebrates-its-first-ever-day-of-the-dead-parade-video). This will be considered PostModern when most of the people forget this tradition started out from a movie and treat it as authentically Mexican. \n4. Imagine an Italian restaurant and there is a giant painting of Marlon Brando. Marlon Brando isn't Italian so why would this represent an Italian restaurant? You might go "Well he the God Father". Well, he wasn't actually the God Father. "But he played one in that movie" ... etc. Yet, if someone were to stumble upon this restaurant, they would probably still come to the conclusion that it was "Italian".  [Video explains it better here](https://youtu.be/80osUvkFIzI?t=3m20s)\n5. The Fifty Shades trilogy was developed from a Twilight fan fiction series originally titled Master of the Universe and published episodically on fan-fiction websites under the pen name "Snowqueen's Icedragon".

I think "anti-capitalists" are mostly sincere people who think are doing what's best for everyone. To us, Government is theft. To them, profit is theft.\n\nThe communist who lives in America has to participate in a system of "wage theft" and I'm sure some minority justify shoplifting as retribution of the thieving nature of "capitalism".\n\n>It's something you're money has paid for.\n\nAs a person who is entering college?

Like Walmart has more "power" than its individual customers and diary farmers.\n\nI assume in most cases where middlemen exist, it is because they are basically necessary (if production could go directly to consumers efficiently, they would cut out the middle man in most cases). I see them forming a sort of bottleneck where it can simulate the collective power of the individuals. In a business context, we call middlemen Retail or B2C/B2B.   \n\nLike Unions can have more power than both the CEO and the workers (individually).

This article is awesome, thanks for the post  OP.
Two points here:\n\n1. Artistically wrong\n2. Morally wrong\n\nFor point 1, Penn is saying artists shouldn't have to hurt themselves or otherwise risk their lives for other's entertainment (as opposed to sports players risking their lives for entertainment). This point might seem uninteresting and unrelated at first but it is important for Penn's distinction. That is: It is ok to simulate horrific/dangerous events in the general case. \n\n>There would have been people at Penn and Teller shows who believed their bullet catch was dangerous\n\nMagicians are supposed to simulate danger without actually presenting danger. What Penn and Teller do is just that. They tell you upfront that it is all safe but they are simulating dangerous events. Assuming that is true and they believe it to be true, they are morally acceptable. \n\nFor point 2, Blaine has a couple of possibilities: Blaine is truly doing a dangerous trick or Blaine is doing a safe trick and lying about it. \n\nIf Blaine is truly doing a dangerous trick, he shouldn't. Its wrong to endanger others. Its wrong to endanger yourself for other's entertainment. \n\nIf Blaine is doing a safe trick and lying about it, "Fuck you". For Penn, it is not ok to simulate dangerous events AND lying about it. \n\nFor both, he doesn't want artists creating an audiences that are "bloodthirsty" for actual danger. He doesn't want others who might think its real to try to get famous by learning the dangerous version of the bullet catch and killing themselves because they saw David Blaine do it.

I think there is a clip saying that he doesn't watch most of the movies he reviews.
I was meaning to compliment you on your international travel.
Immediately, whether you (or anyone else) are actually doing the cost/benefit analysis you think you're doing.\n\nMore broadly, I'm disputing your claim that the state should be charged with "improving society."  The goal is vague and undefinable.  There's no way for anyone to know whether a given project improves society, so that mission just provides the politicians a way to market giveaways to this special interest or that.  "We're helping society by ensuring net neutrality," they'll say, while writing a law that mostly provides corporate welfare for Netflix.
Guess I'm going to be steering clear of South Dakota.  Hard to believe there are still places in the western world where unlicensed hair braiders can remain at large.
Progressive income tax is in practice based on several variables too.  Actually "several" doesn't quite capture it--American households spend 2.6 billion hours per year wrestling with all the variables in the tax code.  And is your information private from the IRS?  Fuggedaboudit.\n\n"Pricing out of the market" is not a meaningful worry on its own, as a market is a mechanism for allocating scarce resources.  By definition all sorts of people are always priced out.\n\nMany companies have long found ways to charge different customers different amounts for the same goods (eg airline seats) to capture more of the [demand curve](https://a16zcdixon.files.wordpress.com/2014/05/screen-shot-2012-06-29-at-9-32-47-pm.png?w=842) and ensure that more people can buy more of their stuff.  And they generally take the same "progressive" approach the government does: extracting more money from their richer customers.

> could I assume that you find the mob boss innocent?\n\nIf he peacefully asked "please go kill this person," yes.  Of course, you've made him a mob boss rather than a little old lady or an 8-year-old kid, and they tend not to ask nicely.  If he threatened the hitman, he's not innocent.\n\nTake it from the other point of view.  Hitman kills someone, gets caught.  Would you consider "well, so-and-so asked me to" a valid defense?
You might think you're doing that, but it's not actually possible to do, for three reasons.  \n\nFirst, costs are often hidden.  The interstate highway system cost about $114 billion, or 21% of GDP in 1960.  That means about 14 million man-years went into its construction, as well a huge amount of physical resources like concrete and bulldozers and surveying equipment and telephones and typewriters and so on.  If those resources had been left free to do build other things, what might they have produced?  There's no way to know, even in retrospect.\n\nSecond, cause and effect can't be definitely established in a complex world.  The interstate highways contributed to the death of railroads, but the Interstate Commerce Commission contributed in 1947 by limiting the speed trains could run, and probably a thousand other factors played a role too.  How do you tease out the contribution of the highways?\n\nThird, even if you could see and definitively attribute every cause and every benefit, there's no way to do math on them.  If the highway helps me by cutting 10 minutes off my commute, but it hurts you by creating more traffic in your previously quiet neighborhood, does that benefit outweigh that cost?  Your answer inevitably depends on your point of view, not on objective numbers.
Then I'm not sure what you're disagreeing with.  I'm claiming one of the reasons automation is good is it enabled us to exempt whole subgroups of the population from work, some partially, some completely, some temporarily, some permanently.  And further automation will bring further such benefits.  
It is not healthy to dissuade people from saving.  It leaves them and the economy vulnerable to shocks.\n\nMoreover savings means investment.  The economy is better off if more resources are being invested to create future growth rather than burned on immediate consumption.
No.  \n\nPerhaps you could define what you mean by "banking sector" that can be evaluated independently of the Fed, FDIC, etc?
Of course rough measures are enough to make a decision...if you don't care about actual impacts beyond what you can immediately see.  Which no one in this line of work does.  You don't make it to Congress unless you're comfortable making decisions affecting millions of people based on hunches, whims, and hand-waves.\n\nBut if you're going to keep insisting these decisions are quantitatively sound, show me the data.  Take interstate highways or any other project of your choosing, and show me how they estimated opportunity costs and largely avoided unforeseen consequences.\n
As I said above, we can't measure their effects even in hindsight.  We can't see all the effects, and even if we could, every effect has a thousand contributing causes.  One side says the 2009 stimulus was a failure that raised unemployment and dragged out the recovery, the other side says it saved us from even worse problems we never saw.  The conclusion inevitably becomes a matter of whom you care to believe.\n\nBut suppose you could see causes and effects clearly, and everyone agreed with you.  You *still* couldn't extrapolate what the next project would do, because the projects and conditions never really repeat.  The 2008 financial crisis was unique from those before it, and the next one will be different again.  There was never a Dodd-Frank act before to predict what the current one will do.  
> That's the "receiving end" of capitalism.\n\nNo, that's the receiving end of statism.\n\n> "Don't blame capitalists for taking advantage of what the Government does on their behalf."\n\nRight.  Politicians have a job to navigate the millions of special interest groups lobbying them for this and that, and to deliver policies that serve the so-called public interest.  That's why they they get paid.  Can we agree on that?\n\nCapitalists, environmentalists, unionists, scientists, seniors...none of them was hired to do that job.  They're part of the public the government is supposed to be serving, and *of course* they're going to lobby for their own interests.  They're doing the role they're *supposed to do*.  \n\nI'm not saying this system works well, quite the opposite, just pointing out where accountability belongs.
These "what if everyone just agreed" descriptions of society are difficult to take seriously.  Just tell us under what conditions the guns come out.
The hitman, obviously.
"Squander it" is not in the author's vocabulary, as that implies decision-making capability.  Blacks are hapless victims.

Just run the numbers to see what an awful business model this is.  Your employees will demand a premium for getting killed, and then you'll have to recruit new ones.  You'll spur your competitors into building their own armies.  You'll not only have big bills to fund your army, your capital investments will keep getting blown up, and you'll have to replace them.  Consumers will associate your brand with violence and steer clear, and your sales will drop.  You'll face mounting pressure from your investors to make peace, unless they've already fired you.\n\nThe only private organizations willing to adopt a violent business model are drug cartels, who aren't allowed to operate peacefully.  When they try (Silk Road, for instance) the government steps in and starts clubbing people.  For the public good, you understand.
It would be great if your post actually included an argument, rather than a pointer to 20 minutes of videos.\n\nAnd it would be even greater if those videos made a sensible argument.  "Technology didn't create more jobs for horses."  No, it created more leisure for horses, and it will continue to create more leisure for us.  That's more of a solution than  problem.

There are a lot of different people not working, and a lot of different circumstances that enable them not to.  Government-funded school for some, welfare for others, marrying well, living off savings, and many other support mechanisms (see &para; 6).  How the picture changes in the future is anyone's guess, but it seems unlikely diversity will yield to one dominant mechanism in the future.

Don't blame capitalism for government's failures.\n\n> Let's try your method of questioning: What is so wrong about feeding the homeless?\n\nNo, that's not my method of questioning.  My question didn't have barbed premise, and it was pertinent to your topic.  You simply don't want to answer.\n\n No one opposed feeding the homeless, we weren't even talking about feeding the homeless, so I have no idea what your question refers to.\n\nDid you do a lot of drugs at some point in your life?  \n
A highway connecting two important cities *seemed* like a clear win [when Eisenhower built a bunch of them](https://s3.amazonaws.com/s3.timetoast.com/public/uploads/photos/3879370/IH.jpg?1366523948).  But it led to urban sprawl, people living more of their lives in their cars, and increased carbon emissions which people lately suspect might have some negative consequences.  Unfortunately the interstate system also helped demolish the US passenger rail industry, so there's not nearly as much mass transit available as the left would like to see.\n\nEverything has a cost, so therefore everything creates winners and losers, not necessarily easy ones to predict.  Nothing is truly beneficial to everyone, so if the government limited itself to that, it would have nothing to do.  
> it's just playing with numbers to make your point seem right. \n\nWell, glad to hear my point seems right.\n\n> If I have nobody to support me working then I'm fucked\n\nNot a problem socialism will solve for you.
Huh?  Didn't we declare war on Germany?
The peace was bad, but the preceding war was worse.

I asked you a question.
> become an behemoth monopoly that actually stifles innovation\n\nIs there evidence that businesses can become monopolies or stifle innovation on their own, ie without the government prosecuting competing innovators under patent laws or licensing laws or other regulations?
Yes, you said that before, and you haven't substantiated the charge that I mangled anything.  You just seem to be reading some claim into my argument that requires some other stats, but we haven't managed to haul that claim into the light.  \n\nI'm happy to go into it with a hairless stats prof, so feel free to bring her on.\n
I'm not sure what you mean by "base population."  320M is the *actual* population of the country, all of whom are actually consuming resources every day.  And thanks to automation, only half of them need to produce resources, a smaller number than ever before.  We have the luxury of considering entire classes of people exempt from the expectation of work, and we will have more such luxuries in the future.
Chronologically too.
"Tuition free" simply means SF residents pay for *not* attending classes.
I was a more or less conventional liberal, though I was always vaguely uneasy with American liberalism's contradictions and paradoxes and appalled by the left's strong anti-intellectual streak.  \n\nI started listening to and reading libertarians and found them reliably rational, well-researched, and with a clarity of thought no one else serves up.  I was finally able to see liberalism's bad assumptions, reject them, and the contradictions fell away.
> Did you see any of the other words in that sentence, like "working" and "destitute", or did you just miss them?\n\nI did.  They don't change anything.  The destitute, and whoever the "working" jobless are you're referring to, are living off someone else or a number of such someones.\n\n
> it does not rely on donations.\n\nMerely on politics.
Makes no sense at all.  Employers compete ferociously over workers.  Only 3% of workers make the minimum wage.  If labor markets are somehow exempt from having to match supply and demand, and employers get to dictate wages, why are virtually all of them leaving so much money on the table?
> Gene editing though will insure that social classes will not only be divided by wealth but their DNA as well.\n\nRight, right.  And only the rich could possibly afford automobiles, so they'd be zipping along at a hair-raising 20 miles per hour while the poor struggled on foot.\n\nOf course, the reality was exactly the opposite, the auto was a great leveler.  The rich now travel in nice cars, the poor in merely okay ones, but they both arrive about the same time.
Read the OP.
> Costs come from material cost, transport ect.\n\nIf that's your understanding of costs, it's no wonder you think they're mild.  Materials literally grow on trees.  \n\nNo, costs are the *negative outcomes human beings suffer* in exchange for the benefit.\n\n> Everything has a cost, but it's not on par with the benefits.\n\nWe can generally know the opposite to be true.  Government projects always involve taking money (and therefore physical resources) away from thing A people were choosing to buy and forcing them to spend it on thing B they weren't.  Unless the government was preventing a market from operating and giving them the choice of buying thing B, we know they preferred A.  So the human cost of going without thing A exceeds the benefit of having thing B.
Circular argument much?
Whose wages specifically?  Mine have risen dramatically since the 1970s, as they probably have for most people receiving a wage back then and today.\n\nMoreover, people today generally enjoy higher standards of living than people in the 1970s. Hands up, everyone who wants to go back to listening to your 8-track tape player in your exploding Pinto with no air conditioning.
Not a single word about costs?  Dude.\n\nYes, we can agree if you ignore costs these projects usually look beneficial.  If you shift resources into healthcare, hopefully healthcare gets better.  If you shift resources into roads, you get more road travel and more road-centric commerce.  (Though I think it's a stretch to credit Poland's general economic improvement to new roads.  Wikipedia credits economic liberalization and low debt levels, and [doesn't mention the roads](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_Poland).) 
Not sure what you think my claim was.  Whom you consider eligible or ineligible for work was not relevant to it.\n
Food insecure could mean the store was out of organic kale, so you had to buy regular.   The definition is very loose.
If first-degree price discrimination is a problem, we have to get rid of progressive taxation.
Sorry, what is your point?  That children, students, and retirees can't be considered not working?
The online world seems to be brimming with people eager to deny the poor had any hand in creating their poverty.  Yet none of them seems to be a member of that class.  They're probably students at some liberal college, home for the summer with Mom and Dad, and demonstrating their compassion for the poor by denying them human agency and denouncing "victim blamers."  Armchair poor, you might say.\n\nDo the genuinely poor actually do that?  I've never heard a fat person claim their weight was engineered by someone else.
First, that article acknowledges that employers are paying more, they're just not paying it in cash.  They're paying more fringe benefits like healthcare.  They're paying more payroll tax.\n\nSecond, the average wage trend doesn't describe actual people.  No one sits at the average wage decade after decade. Our careers advance, we get raises, we eventually retire.  "Wage stagnation" is not an appropriate label for the graph, because no one's wage necessarily stagnated.\n\nThird, the productivity paradox has another statistical flaw in the different inflation corrections used for productivity and wages.  Correct that, and look at total compensation including benefits, and the divergence disappears.
What are you taking about?
> But you do know the cost of the project...\n\nNo, you don't, for all three of the reasons I wrote above.  You have a dollar value for what the government paid, but that's not the whole cost.  What about the hardship suffered by the people the highways displaced via eminent domain?  What about the habitats disturbed by the highways?  What about the additional carbon emissions?  What about the opportunity cost of society having to go without all the other stuff those 14 million people would have produced?  They might have built schools that educated revolutionary geniuses.  They might have cured diseases.  They might have saved lives.    \n
> Eight men own more than 3.6 billion people, and they're not sharing.\n\nLet's be rational.  Abundance over here is not evidence of scarcity over there.  Heavy rainfall in Louisiana is not evidence of a drought in California.\n\nAnd BTW, [they are sharing](http://fortune.com/2016/06/01/giving-pledge-new-members-2016/).
> Aw, you ignored my punchline...\n\nAnd you ignored my data.
Starvation in the US is too small to measure.  Good luck finding a statistic on it.  Welfare advocates have had to make up a new "food insecurity" concept to preserve a sense of crisis.  
The other argument for option 4--selling the mushrooms to the other people--is it means less mushroom waste.  The people who buy mushrooms will on the whole be the the ones who want them.  People who don't care for mushrooms won't be allocated a mushroom that just gets thrown away.
> And this has literally nothing to do with the question.\n\nThat has everything to do with the question.  The banking sector is a network of firms and agencies structured by the government to enable central control over the money supply.
All the more reason to get them back on their yachts, eh what?
Depends on your point of view.  If you're the one operating the printing presses, inflation is a marvelous thing.  Even better if you find yourself $20 trillion in debt.\n\nOn the other hand if you're a worker earning a paycheck that adjusts for inflation only after a delay, inflation is robbing you more demonstrably than any capitalist.  Or if you're a saver trying to build a nest-egg for retirement, inflation is a hole in the bottom of your piggy bank.  Or if you're a consumer who spends weekends shopping for lower prices, inflation sets you right back where you started.\n\nCertainly inflation can be handled by state intervention, if one understands a "handle" to be a way to raise something up.  The US government set up the Federal Reserve in 1913 to prevent inflation and maintain the value of the currency.  The currency has lost 99% of its value since then, and the Fed wants it to lose another 2% every year.  \n\nIt is by no means inevitable.  Productivity rises by a couple percent a year, and all other things being equal that should translate into gradually *falling* prices.  Indeed Americans enjoyed about 30 years of falling prices and rising real incomes in the latter half of the 19th century.  Either that news has not reached Janet Yellen, or she's looking after her employer's interests.
Indeed they do.  Like getting less work and more leisure.
> Who suffers from built roads? Who suffers from health care? It's literally only materials, which you have buy for money that's taxed.\n\nI've answered this several times.  Please read my earlier comments.
What were those workers doing before the sweatshops?  Why did they work in them?
Is that a principle?
Go find the statistics, then come back and say that.
> There are literally millions of people living miserable lives because the pace of economic change is faster than their ability to adapt to it\n\nSure.  Let's call it 16M, or 10% of the workforce.  Which is to say the other 90% is adapting okay.\n\nAre you imagining that economic transition pinched fewer than 10% of workers in the past decades?  Or that it will be pinching more than 10% in the future?  Where's the evidence?

Cars did indeed change the DNA of your children by allowing you to meet and marry people in other towns.\n\nI don't think you've made your case that more DNA choices will stratify society in some deeper way than it already is.  And what free markets have to do with it is not clear.
If I loan you $100, you have $100 more and I have $100 less.  Money changed hands but the money supply didn't change.  Loans and credit are not inflationary.\n\nBut suppose you're a US bank, and therefore part of the Federal Reserve system.  I loan you $100 by depositing it in my savings account.  You get to loan out $90 of that, while representing the remaining $10 as $100 you're still holding.  Having your cake and eating it too.  This does increase the money supply.
I guess his slavish devotion to the truth will prevent him from saying that now.
I'm against both the banking sector and macroprudential policy.  You don't have a free market if there's a Soviet Commissar in charge of the money.
The word "starvation" doesn't appear on either page.  They are talking about "food insecurity."  Exactly as I said.
Yes, discrimination happens both directions with private sector transactions: the seller chooses what price to set (whether a standard one or one customized per person), and the buyer gets to choose to buy or walk.  With tax it's a one-way deal, as the buyer of public services might choose not to use a service but can't choose whether to pay for it.  Thus many odious programs such as the war on drugs stay funded for decades.
> You can make a pretty good guess that making a road will ease transport.\n\nExactly.  That's what everyone who says they're weighing pros and cons always does: points out one visible benefit and ignores the costs, especially hidden ones.  You're not weighing anything.
> inflation incentivizes investment due to the need to keep up with the rising cost of goods and services. \n\nDidn't you just say it pushes people to spend their money now rather than invest it?  If you've reconsidered that position, I agree with you it pushes people into riskier investments than they would have otherwise chosen.  You can no longer save by putting money in a savings account, everyone now has to be a stockmarket speculator.  This is not a healthy development.\n\n> Deflation incentivizes putting your money under a mattress and letting it increase in value.\n\nSure, and so what?  Stashing $20 bills away doesn't change the amount of physical resources in the economy, it just means everyone else's dollars can now buy more of them.\n\n> Not having any savings at all is just bad money management and would be a problem regardless of inflation or deflation\n\nYes, but we were discussing cause and effect the other way.  Inflation makes it more likely you won't have any savings at all.  If banks are paying 0.1% interest and inflation is at 2%, a savings account doesn't look very enticing.\n\n
I haven't prescribed anything "the economy" needs; I don't recognize the economy as a Thing with Needs.\n\nBut you might take it up with the socialists making exactly that claim, where X=UBI. Or the Keynesians, where X=low interest rates or inflation or wage supports or big spending programs.
Where can I get one of these robots that can pay taxes so I don't have to?  I need it by early April.
Curiously [wages have been rising](http://www.tradingeconomics.com/ecuador/wages?embed).  Apparently something other than social spending is at work.
> Because you're ignoring the setting, you're ignoring the purpose, you're ignoring why they're there\n\nThat's exactly what I asked about:  why are they showing up for work?  What alternatives are available in their setting?\n\n\n\n
> "People are unhappy with their jobs, so it doesn't matter that some people have trouble securing one" See how those two ideas just don't connect at all like that?\n\nNotice how you made up the second half and attributed it to me?\n\n> a bunch of hooker'd up alcoholics\n\nLol, there's your leisure class.
> How can I debate morality with someone who showcased himself to have zero moral base?\n\nEasy: by articulating and defending an alternate moral principle.  What specifically is the mob boss guilty of?  It's not quite murder, is it?  If I pray to God to smite you down, or suggest to the internet that the world would be better off without you, am I guilty of murder?\n\nAt least, questions like this are easy if you're clear on your own principles.
> I was paraphrasing. \n\nYou were misrepresenting.  I was pretty explicit about carving out the people unhappy not to be working from the larger majority, and I never said the latter "don't matter."\n\n> You lump children, homemakers, the homeless, undocumented workers and slaves all together under "not working".  Like I said, it's a very creative way to interpret those stats.\n\nThere's nothing creative about it.  The Census Department classifies people not holding or looking for a formal job as "not in the labor force."  No question put work, often very hard work, toward all sorts of things that aren't counted in GDP or employment statistics.  But focusing on paid labor is pretty routine in discussion of jobs.
No, that's how I respond to truisms.  Anyone not supporting himself is living off someone else.  Something we can agree on, at last.
> so that he can further his company's goals of subverting laws around self-driving cars.\n\nThank God, the left is here to protect us from self-driving cars.
Yes, many are.  Or stay at home parents. Or students. Or people taking time off.  And none of them are starving.
> 1. An 8 or 80 year old not working is not the same thing as a 30 year out of the labor force.\n\nI'm not sure what that means.  They're all net resource consumers.\n\n> 2. Empirical studies are clear that unemployment is very bad for individuals\n\nRight, which I acknowledged in paragraph #4, there's always transitional pain for individuals.  I don't see how you spare people from that.  The polio vaccine put crutch makers out of work, but the public benefit seems pretty overwhelming.\n\nMy point remains: automation doesn't represent the *chronic* problem for the *whole economy*, which seems to be what the daily posts on this topic fret about.
> The whole point of what?\n\nHuman striving.
You're attempting to debate someone clear on the moral principle he's arguing.  \n\nIt doesn't sound like your arguments are guided by any particular principle, so I'm going to be able to keep posing questions you can't answer.  If you're not comfortable with that, bailing is probably a wise move.
> unemployment is a nonissue" are generally either working, living off someone working, or destitute\n\nOf course they're living off someone working.  Your criticism is content free.
Really?  How many people do you know who are making less than they did 5 or 10 years ago?  In fact people typically get a [3% raise every year](https://www.mercer.com/newsroom/pay-raises-for-us-employees-continue-to-grow-steadily-new-mercer-survey-finds.html).  \n\nIf you want to take a brief look over modern history, the BLS tracks an [employment cost index](https://dlc.erieri.com/onlinetextbook/images/graphs/fig21-1.gif), which has exceeded inflation every year for decades.  People are getting paid more.  Working hours, meanwhile, have been [falling for decades](https://dunstewart.files.wordpress.com/2014/05/global-decline-of-annual-work-hours.jpg).
160 million Americans don't.
Who said anything about "perfect"?  You need at least good data to make a good decision, and you don't have any data at all.\n\nYou have a general sense that drivers will like a new highway, but you have no way to quantify the benefit to them or anyone else.  Maybe the highway will make new freight supply lines profitable, and maybe that will mean more jobs for truckers.  And maybe it will bring fresher food to one of the cities.  And maybe that will improve some people's health.  No data in any of that, just a bunch of unquantifiable maybes.\n\nOn the cost side, you don't even have maybes.  There's the sticker price of the highway, but that just gives the magnitude of the resources the government is taking from other parts of the economy to fund the highway.  It doesn't tell you anything about the cost to society--the things that are going to be worse without those resources.  And you're probably not even trying to imagine what those things might be, because like everyone else who advocates for new infrastructure projects, you're all excited about the new highway and the faster travel and the new jobs and the healthier kids.  Who cares about costs?
> capitalism fucks over the unemployed. \n\nHow do you figure?\n
> It's far more subtle than it once was, but reparations are owed for a long history of violations of human rights.\n\nThat's what you need to demonstrate with evidence.  It is far from obvious what Africans' human rights people in Greenwich are violating.\n\n

5,500+ upvotes, what can we do? we know the city this all went down in right? Angry calls to the station? Letters to somewhere? I feel like if any cop shop got 5,500 calls it might wake them up. I just can't sit back anymore, I've been hearing stories like this for years and I want to do more. This could have been any of us. 
That's it. Of the two things that could have happened, everyone here sees the second, and everyone there sees the first. Because there are women who overreact and cause trouble, and also men who get too drunk and cause trouble. 
"I can only show you the door, you're the one that has to walk through it" 
MGTOW aren't dependent on the online community, it's just another thing they do in their spare time. 
yes lol, to me at least, and that's where the difference lies.
You might be able to flat ask him. "Why are you still together? " or something like that. Get him talking about why he won't leave, don't push too hard. Maybe talking about it out loud might help. 
The two people talking to him were pissing me off because they wouldn't let him finish. 
nobody has everything
Bill Burr has a funny bit on this. "Why don't they band together, and come up with something of their own? It's because they don't want their own shit, they want our shit."
guys! Hillary really is just like us! 
what do the people censoring have to gain though? they can't be making money off of a non working populous? is it all just to avoid appearing racist??
I wish Hollywood would stop apologizing and catering to this. The only reason they have power is because people take them seriously...
Biology is not something that can be fought easily. Someone your age I'd almost say get into a relationship so you can have some first hand experience. Wear a rubber, treat her well, and just see what happens. Strong chance she'll end up dumping you for someone else so just be prepared for that. 
I think the point might be that they're all talk and won't take any action because... that takes actual work. They're quick to point and scream and cry intolerance/unfairness but will never go beyond that. IMO everyone needs to take them much less seriously. 
I read the one where they link to the story of that guy leaving his regular bar because of a crazy cunt. it's literally the exact opposite of what we were saying. it was really strange tbh...
my God what is this sub?! 
still bought a ticket and contributed to it's profits 
Must be an alternate timeline
This is such a brilliant idea!
Don't kill yourself, be patient, it'll happen eventually. In the meantime I suggest searching for something that makes the pain of existence tolerable. With the extra money you have not being wasted on a woman, try a shitload of different things. At the very least, watch the craziness in the world as a spectator, it's a bit better than cable.  
Sonic 2 for the Sega. She can pick up the controller whenever and then leave when she gets bored after 5 minutes.  It's perfect. 
Does 3D modeling really require a good PC though? Could I do it on any machine?
an abusive creep? he called the pool ball a slut because he was drunk. it was a misunderstanding that people blew out of proportion. 
Why are people making a big deal about this? Shouldn't we just let them do it and watch the chaos that ensues?
Tell that to Europe where the immigrants are actively trying to outbreed the native population
They know nobody believes this.  It's a statement. They're never changing their position...
The fire rises!
Nice to see some red pill on the front page
The real MVP for posting the story! \nAlso, "if a man has disposable income and likes a woman doesn't he want to treat her?"  no... no not at all lol
it leads to someone admitting they were knowingly breaking a law but were doing it anyway. 
I was with you until that last sentence. But you have a point, no need to have 10 kids anymore because half of them don't die before the age of 5 anymore. 
I won't be able to play at all on Friday,  can I be one of the first matches Saturday? 
MGTOW
Eat Another Day. The Food Is Not Enough. Goldenstomach.
Furiosa!
I've been thinking about this too. Those guys in the '50s knew what was up. 
haha no way! new there were herbivore men but not that many. 
I think it has something to say about how women need the protection of men because they don't protect each other. 
"You're hate makes you powerful"
Zooming in way too far on the penetration and lingering on that shot for way too long. That's not why I'm watching.
bachelor tax
Your comment hit me right in the feels man :/
All of this. It's upsets me when people say "you're not a true mgtow if you do x". If you're going your own way, doing your own thing, that's all it takes to be a mgtow.
If the people donating were moderately smart they just wouldn't donate and these things wouldn't be a viable way to get money. 
Mhhhmmmm justice. So glad to see that white knight in cuffs at the end. Too bad he probably won't learn his lesson and that chick he was "defending" still won't sleep with him.
This is how man was meant to live
And it's free. They're truly doing God's work. 
you'll want to experience it. you'll feel a "pull" to see what it is everyone is talking about for yourself. just always wear a rubber, and if it's too good to be true, that's because it is. God speed. 
it makes me feel good that when they hit their 30's and want to settle down, they realize their looks are fading and men have lost interest.  like some sort of cosmic justice :]
I like that analogy of a loaded gun
"So rich people can get a tax cut"... I think she meant "So small businesses owners and entrepreneurs can put money into growth instead of paying the government"
Doing nothing can help us marinate in our thoughts and feelings. Instead of being constantly distracted by the world around us. 
Same!! When I'm connected to my wifi it's fine, but as soon as I go outside and connect to mobile data it says the servers are down.... And now I'm only falling further behind everyone else :[
lolol PUNT THAT CUNT
Idk about wait times, but I always keep them at arms length. Although this makes some of them try harder to get close which makes me push them further out. If they're just a female human living their life and our paths cross for a while I don't have problems doing things with them. Would still never marry or date one though. 
"3 minutes on the treadmill, time to reward myself with a triple cheeseburger and large fries from McDonalds"
I'm not the one making the queue sniping threads tough guy, calm your nerd rage.\n
Even if it does turn into a mainstream trend, I think we'll be relatively unaffected unless laws get passed. That's the best thing, we go our own way, independent of everything else
such a huge selection of women without any of the bull shit that comes with it 
Looks like the Internet is leaking into real life again
Good. Serves them right. They've made their bed and now they have to shit in it.
"I had strings, but now I'm free"
Love these comic strips
some people curse at inanimate objects?
I DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW ANYONE CAN SUPPORT HER
scrolled for this :)
Hey man, I know that feeling. Dated a couple girls and would surprise them with flowers and other home-made gifts and yes, unfortunately, poems in my younger days. Honestly, that feeling hasn't left me entirely. It's still there, hoping... wishing. I'm not sure if this will work for you, but I've redirected that energy towards my friends and family. I write them nice letters from time to time, drive 2 hours in a moments notice to hang out with them. It's disappointed the hopeless romantic in me because it's brought me much more happiness than a girlfriend ever could. Hope it helps bro. 
I love his high kicks though
why would he call the girl a slut? they just met. 
those findings don't "feel" right
I wish feminism was more like this. 
OP didnt deliver, next you're going to tell me the pope doesn't shit in the woods.
what do you think r/MGTOW is about? 
Honestly, if you have to ask, you probably already know the answer.. Try to imagine living with her every. single. day. "Awful with money " alone should be a big enough red flag... Her debts become your debts. You divorce now you owe her a fat alimony check each month. Good luck.
And of course this is all men's fault. I wonder what kind of world we'd be living in if women were introspective and took responsibility for anything. 
Which is ironic because i thought they preach your weight doesnt matter. Must be a certin threshold you need to break before weight isnt important.
I've never actually missed be sober until shrooms.
Assventure Time!! So many bad puns. Would recommend!
ohhh so you think you're completely unsucceptible to making a bad decision based on hormones and emotion rather than fact and logic then. well, good luck with that
yeah, empowering for the guy that's fucking your wife
Nothing compares to personal experience. If there's a girl out there you'd like to date, ask her out. Treat her well, see what happens.  Otherwise you might always wonder. But don't forget the warnings, and always protect yourself. Godspeed.
What's going on and how can I help?
there's a sub where people cook their entire weeks worth of food on Sunday and eat leftovers all week. cooking once or twice a week is infinitely easier than trying to cook a healthy meal every single day. also snack on things like carrots, sweat peas, grapes, etc instead of junk food.  My $.02
where can I find more? 
the hostility is real
This. 10 million times this. I cringe everytime I hear someone say they're "going on a diet". NO! You should be "changing your diet". Infinitely greater chance of successfully losing and keeping weight off.
next time a buddy is complaining about his wife/gf's shady behavior tell him, "show me the whorefax!" Get your FREE whorefax report before you mess with a woman! 
I believe it because I call our coppier at work a whore sometimes. it's strange how you assert that this man's intentions had to be that of harassing a stand-up young woman at a bar. 
better luck next time
I think they're talking about the whole "we only use 10% of our brains" thing. But i thought that was just misinformation...
Can't say it's my absolute favorite because i haven't seen them all. But i really liked the end of the trump winning video. With the song "how could this happen to me" with the pic of Hillary lolol.
What would a real mgtow do?
This is for the people that aren't as lucky to live in a dense area. I get why people are downloading it...
I mean, even with men business owners the money could still be going to a women. But I've noticed I'm gravitating towards smaller businesses because I appreciate the amount of work it takes to literally run your own business. 
well, in WI two pitchers in a night isn't that crazy. the guy's been going there after work for two years. I think he tried to explain himself and did mention he apologized. but this is all perspective. it's interesting because MGTOW and TBP seem to be nearly exact opposites of each other. 
Drove to visit spend a night with my old college roomates last night, staying with a from high school tonight, going up north to watch fire works with some other friends tomorrow. 
Doesn't Canada's "universal healthcare" have awful wait times? and people sometimes come down to the states just to get decent service? 
Some feel that to be a mgtow you must not have any relations with a woman, others feel you can date as long as you don't get married, and some still believe you can have a wife and kids and still call yourself a mgtow. This isn't like AA where we swear to never touch a woman again and you can't relapse. Just put yourself first. Do the things you want to do and don't give something up for a woman, or a man for that matter. Always keep your guard up and follow your own path. When in doubt, rub one out.
This is a really interesting question. We all know that rape occurs in our societies, and it has occurred for many years. People are crazy. So, having read the comment reply from /u/michaeltheobnoxious ; I somewhat agree with him in the sense that some sort of fitting punishment would have to be decided upon and allocated.\n\nNow, I tend to believe in more Mutualistic ideologies, so I've done some work for you - to educate myself, and hopefully educate anyone who reads this as well. I actually, believe it or not, managed to Google your question! Who would have thought you could Google a question instead of putting it on Reddit huh? I must be some kind of genius (I just did an IQ test here: http://test.mensa.no/# and this was my result "Your IQ was measured to 133, which is equivalent to the 98.6 percentile.").\n\nPro-tip: Google for an answer first, and then people will take you more seriously. This is /r/DebateAnarchism not /r/AskAnarchism, which means you can't just watch Fox News and spew the same stuff, you should do some research - the equivalent of which on an anonymous message board website on the internet (Reddit) would be to Google it. \n\nSo now that I have educated in that matter let us proceed.\n\nThis was the first result on Google. The effort required: 1 click, and half a scroll down. Results: http://anarchy101.org/2784/would-anarchist-society-with-crimes-like-rape-serial-murder\n\nIn order to make it EVEN easier for you, I will copypasta here:\n\n>There are so many clarifying questions/objections required by your casual statement... For an anarchist to use a term like "crime" is automatically a problem; such a concept is meaningless in a context where deviant (non-normative) behavior is dealt with by the affected individuals making up a community/commune/affinity group (or whatever other meaningful level of social organization you like). That's commonly called Direct Action. "Crime" is a legal category, requiring an institutionalized system of allegedly neutral conflict resolution to take the place of what the statists see as their purview alone: retaliation, retribution, vengeance (the pretense to rehabilitation should be, by now, completely discredited). This usually takes the form of arrest, trial, and incarceration. In short, punishment for behaving outside the parameters decided by those who run the State. By taking the response to deviance out of the hands of those directly affected, the legal authorities are merely delegitimizing (and making it a crime!) the autonomy and cohesion of any meaningful level of social organization. \n\n>What would happen in an anarchist society to deal with rape and murder would probably look a lot like what happens in other non-statist cultures when someone does something particularly nasty: the survivor, the family and friends decide how to proceed, whether it's one or more of the following. Public shaming or beating; concern coupled with compassion and care; expulsion; execution -- and a million other possibilities in between. All options are on the table, unlike what happens in statist cultures, where the authorities decide the punishment in a sham neutrality for the good of "the people."\n\n>*lawrence (Mar 27, 2012)*
dude the only reason i made the joke of trump supporter is cos u made the joke of bernie supporter first. i know what banter is.
**A TABLE FOR ONE...OR NINE...DEPENDING IF YOU COUNT MYSELF OR MY TENTACLES COLLECTIVELY**
Just because your Malay does t mean you HAVE to be Muslim? Just tell them you're Buddhist.
Define culture
self defence is okay, violence is not. so unless the DNC or GOP start killing people, dont kill them. also you dont have to kill them, you can just break their legs to stop them from killing you.
Lack of education with regards to diet, and unhealthy food practices (teh o ais, teh ais limau at mamak - it all has a LOT of sugar i.e. basically a canned drink)...\n\nIt's tasty though, but its up to you to ensure you moderate your consumption. People need to be educated on this topic, and know the late life side effects (diabetes and health complications). Once people are educated on it, then it is up to them to decide if they want to change their lifestyle or not.\n\nAs for those of you who love the RM1 canned drinks. Tap water is free. So it's not been about the price, its been about your addiction to sugar. Sugar is addictive, don't get me wrong. I read in some science journal (someone pls find if confirmation is asked for) - that sugar activates the same thing as cocaine therefore it is clearly possible that it can be an addictive substance.\n\nSo we need to be educated on the matter, with regards to a healthy lifestyle. Once that is done, then it is up to us. I'd rather the government didn't start putting legislation on the drinks etc. because that will just make it worse for those of us who do moderate our consumption.
You said fascists aren't proposing ethnic cleansing. So what are they proposing then?
Najib stole 1 billion USD from 1MDB - money meant for the people. We found out (sarawak report), so he makes GST to recoup that money. Najib has destroyed this country, if I ever elected as PM, I will jail all those fucking BN cunts from Mahathir to Hishamuddin.
Just make your own at home?
fine, sorry. I have just been on reddit too much the past few days, and the news we see everyday is so bad enough to make you get angry like this...i am sorry and i will take a break to cool off...sorry guys
?
Basically, Malays have such a shit life because of the royal family and therefore they take it out on the non-Malays.\n\nRoyal family set up JAIS after all and fund them from crown money, meanwhile King's grandchildren all go international school and expnsive university in UK whre they drink until mabuk and vomit everywhere.
umbilical cord tapeworm taxonomy, haha!
Yeah, fuck official regulation. If you park like a cunt, I'll break your fucking windscreen so you'll realise to avoid being a cunt next time.
Saudi Muslim model has kept the one royal family in power for many decades, Najib wants the same with BN; and the Malay royals want to keep exploiting the riches of the country.\n\nOppress the people, blame it on the non-Malays. Ensure majority of the population is under-educated so they don't realise this, keep feeding them Star news and Berita Harian propaganda, ez win for Najib and his corrupt group.
Read it once more.\n\nYou say >If the decision is simply left to a trail by community\n\nThat's not the case, the user *lawrence* said: >the survivor, the family and friends decide how to proceed\n\nThe rapist gets no representation here. So therefore, if the victim (given that his/her family and friends will certainly be making a decision which aligns with his/her own) - will be left to make the decision - punishment, death, or even he/she may choose to forgive the individual and let him off with simple community service.\n\nI am aware of the victim blaming culture, and I am appalled by it. So there you go, there's no state that indicates a community (jury) should decide the verdict. The victim does. So there's no victim blaming groups causing the rapist to be let off free. \n\nI don't know if you came just looking to argue, or you didn't understand what "*the survivor, the family and friends decide how to proceed*" means
Okay, call me dumb. Lol. Enjoy more years of BN fucking you over :) no brains to realise it, ez win for umno
How on earth would they track you down on reddit? I use a fake email, fake location...so?
nvm found someone already
yea hey cool /r/The_Donald is elsewhere
What on earth are this many kids doing on the road? Share this message so your kids will learn to avoid stupid activities like this. 
Offer diet option and advertise diet option, and put health warnings on the non-diet version (like cigarette packet)
I didn't assume shit, I was just making a joke in reference to the meme. Wow you need some weed.
I don't have Instagram, thank god.
You're right, and that's why it's becoming so hard to use the subreddits I used to frequent years ago. I spent a good part of last year getting banned from my favourite subreddits and having to make a new account. Only recently have I learned of this plague on reddit, I hope reddit clears it up or someone creates a better message board.
Your counter argument was switching from fascism to nazism, so...
**HEY YOU'RE RANCH DUBOIS**
Thanks for helping me understand, but regardless of the cause, now the effect is the same.
Cool, I'll see what I can do with regards to my old flatmates making some time
and we have a winner!
Good, now the European countries hiring North Korean workers need to stop paying them and the world will be a better place
FUCK OFF
I think you meant mellow mike
This.
Hey, just FYI /r/Anarchism was taken over by some hormonal teenagers engaged in some SJW spree - similar to the ASJW spree on /r/The_Donald. \n\nWe need to keep our communities safe and vet our moderators extremely.
comrades? this isn't /r/soviet_union
Haha, poor Malays. Forced into a religion they don't care for. This country is becoming Malaysia truly Araaabiaaaaa
LOL. Okay, so I have realised something. Donald Trump's white house is effectively run the same way /r/The_Donald is: "if you don't support me 100%, you're out".\n\nHaha, democracy is dead.
thank god im not malay lol, even their own country hates them
quite rude...
ya lah, but they dont have same values as malaysians...we have more culture....
haha i found a trumpkin
What? I am genuinely impressed lol, no idea why I'm getting downvoted - are we supposed to be hating on Bose?
It was a different commenter, but you rushed in to defend him, so you  are effectively a representative of him in this argument, and therefore you are acting as an expansion of him.\n\nDebating 101
It's not my fault you thought History of Art was a good major. Natural selection weeds out the stupid from our society.
Sad...perhaps instead of stealing 1 billion of money from 1MDB, najib should have used it to develop youth programmes in this country and give the kids things to do (build parks and offer recreation). this is najib's fault.
its a word, its full of letters, nothing more.
> sarcophagus\n\n????
Hire a good lawyer, wear a go pro, prove it was self defence. You won't lose a dime, and he'll be forced to cover your legal expenses.
LOL no, BR1M is just more bumiputera bullshit. Najib charges GST, of which a bulk is paid for by well-off non-Malays in the city, and redistributes it to the useless donkeys in the countryside.\n\nFucking Najib stole 1 billion from 1MDB and then pulls this shit likes hes some sort of god to secure votes for the upcoming election. HAHHAHA MALAYSIA IS FUCKED
Why is /u/Kurorz being so hostile here? Oh well, from his reply it seems like there's no point trying to teach him anything. Ironic isn't it, because the PDRM tried to teach the Mat Bicycle about safety on the road, and still they don't listen. I wouldn't be surprised if /u/Kurorz is a Mat Bicycler himself.
Damn, I came into this debate thinking he wasn't some troll, but someone who had an honest question (albeit a little lazy fella).\n\nNow he says anarchists never answer to anything.\n\nWe just gave a fucking answer, are you too stupid to read?
well duh, islam is the only religion that requires converting. take a hindu or christian who likes to drink and fuck malay girls, he will marry them, convert because he HAS to, but will never go mosque never pray just enjoy life in his home.
Trump calls CNN fake, and then watches FOX. LOL. America is fucked if their president is dumber than my toenail
Fuck North Korea, useless country making zero progress.
Hidden behind the anonymity of the black mirror, people can be cunts and assholes to each other (i.e. post propaganda and get into argument for no benefit). In real life - "you gon act like a bitch u gon die like a bitch"
Better to KYS than engage is violence and murder
So to be specific, you are pointing the finger at 1. the US military and 2. Law Enforcement\n\ni.e. not the DNC and not the GOP
this country blocks alcohol and porn from the malays, no wonder muslims join ISIS - life for them really fucking sucks
So we're here doing Socialism bashing?
that's because chinese kids are busy at changkat drinking alcohol
Oh shit, you're ranch dubois!
I don't get it, every time I say nuclear energy is dangerous on Reddit people get angry and tell me I'm wrong (like when I suggested Fukushima may have effects we are unaware of). If that not the case, why is a giant dome being placed on Chernobyl?
What the fuck did you just fucking say about me, you little bitch? I’ll have you know I graduated top of my class in the Navy Seals, and I’ve been involved in numerous secret raids on Al-Quaeda, and I have over 300 confirmed kills. I am trained in gorilla warfare and I’m the top sniper in the entire US armed forces. You are nothing to me but just another target. I will wipe you the fuck out with precision the likes of which has never been seen before on this Earth, mark my fucking words. You think you can get away with saying that shit to me over the Internet? Think again, fucker. As we speak I am contacting my secret network of spies across the USA and your IP is being traced right now so you better prepare for the storm, maggot. The storm that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call your life. You’re fucking dead, kid. I can be anywhere, anytime, and I can kill you in over seven hundred ways, and that’s just with my bare hands. Not only am I extensively trained in unarmed combat, but I have access to the entire arsenal of the United States Marine Corps and I will use it to its full extent to wipe your miserable ass off the face of the continent, you little shit. If only you could have known what unholy retribution your little “clever” comment was about to bring down upon you, maybe you would have held your fucking tongue. But you couldn’t, you didn’t, and now you’re paying the price, you goddamn idiot. I will shit fury all over you and you will drown in it. You’re fucking dead, kiddo.
Lol  thank god im not Malay
Of course not, it's more like I'll lift up my arms to stop Steve Bannon from sitting on me.\n\n\nI AIN'T NO CHAIR.
My statement was full of bullshit apart from the fact Najib stole money from us, took it back and is now using it to 'buy' votes. The fact you don't understand that just shows that the missing 1MDB money should have been spent on improving Malaysian education and not on Rosmah's hair.
I agree, some of the language and attitude towards these kids on this thread has been a little....worrying.\n\nAt the end of the day, why can't we just all put the hate aside and be 1Malaysia?
You're right.\n\nAnd your conclusion is right too. So finally, we can scroll back to the top, and look at the photo. The train conductor was a responsible person.
Evidence please, we live in an age of unreferenced claims so at this point I am not bothered to respond otherwise.
Similarly, just because I believe everyone should have access to high quality education doesnt mean I am a bernie fan.
Let me be clear… LOL. I see what you did there.
I guess you have a point, but one thing - we were born into and under this system. So, as I said. Unless they attack first, its not libertarian to kill them - which is my point.\n\nHowever, one may argue that through their policies and general bullshit they pull - effectively they are attacking us, via policy and economics rather than physically. In which case I still wouldn't agree with taking physical action against them, unless they do the same to me. I'd just fight their system for now, and do it SO well, that they get pissed off and resort to hitting me. At which point, I lift up my arms and smack both of them to the darkest corner of antartica.

The woman had a driving license and was following the rules (not under intoxication), therefore it's not murder its a traffic accident. Pay bail and go live ur life.\n\nIf she didn't have license, its murder.

scored 133 on this one, putting me at 98.6 percentile. This ties in with my wechslertest.com of 99th percentile. I'll still need to do more than just 2 tests to get a more reliable estimate - anyone got links for a 3rd?
It's fine, God will take care of people who think like that.
No it's not. People aren't attacking anarchists for the same reasons that they are attacking Fascists.\n\nFascists in the west are essentially white supremacists.\n\nAnarchists in the west are essentially people who don't like all this state meddling in affairs we could manage on our own.\n\nPeople attack fascists because they are racist and xenophobic.\n\nPeople attack anarchists because they don't like people going against the establishment.\n\nSo, are the motives the same? Thereby, if you agree that the motives are not the same, the justification is therefore not the same.\n\nSo there you go, hopefully you're here to learn and not just push some egoistic agenda of subtly defending the rising white supremacy movement in the West.
sorry if i was misleading, I meant high quality education. The rich city folk send their kids to private schools, whilst the rest of us are left behind with overcrowded underfunded public schools. How is that fair? From a young age there is an education gap, and that translates to wealth gap in adulthood. How else can this b solved
Um....hindu guy here...what are you saying about our deity worship?

LOL, sounds like the Malaysian version of Breitbart!
In Malaysia, a chinese woman with no license kills 8 kids. I guarantee you she'll get tried for murder - in Malaysia. In Singapore, maybe you're right. In Malaysia, nah.
not university...im talking about ages 5-18...asians have better education systems than us....how is that possible when we are the richest country in the world?

Sorry I didn't see you all the way up there on your high horse. Let me grab my ladder so I can see you, ah, here we are. Now allow me to retort...\n\nI think I responded to another comment regarding indirect ways of killing via policy and economics, so I suggest you read that comment (which is somewhere in this comment thread, not too difficult to find given that you managed to find this one).\n\nThat is all, because the discussion has already been made there and I am not willing to become repetitive, sorry if it comes of as lazy, perhaps I am a little lazy - I'm no superman.
Fair enough, Assange is wreaking havoc on all these elections.

3d modeling would be for 3d printing, nothing sophisticated or dynamic. I could use my desktop for heavy lifting.   \n  \nLaptop would mostly be for programming, most complicated of which would be unity3d. If that's too much to ask for sub 500. I would ditch the 3d modeling, making this largely a code machine I'd be hoping to get a good deal on.
You should consider a 'heat map' of the BurningMons. People won't be able to track with their phones, so if someone wanted to go hunting for them instead of just randomly happening upon them, a general location map would help!

Maaaan I was playing Dead by Daylight and was just about to escape when I get 'Steam Offline' :((((
This. OP needs to learn to say no
I like it. I'm imagining it stacking and the survivors just forming a conga line behind the killer. Struggle - struggle - strug-gle!

I agree! So much so that I made a post just like this one a while ago: https://www.reddit.com/r/survivetheculling/comments/4bbbsl/a_better_idea_for_surprise_me/?ref=share&ref_source=link  \n  \nThere's really zero reason to use Surprise Me! after you've unlocked everything. Would be much more fun this way.

You're the best /u/LonerIM2. I ended up getting the HP EliteBook and getting a HDD to swap out the DVD drive with. The thing is just about to ship.   \n  \nNow that I've thought about it some, this next question is a bit more subjective. Am I going to be okay with that resolution while programming? In my head, 1.5 inch of screen difference between the Acer models and the HP Elitebook does not seem like much, but I'm realizing resolution may be the more important factor. Is that 1366 x 768 res going to drive me nuts?\n

I would love to see a "hold your breath" feature. The length you can hold your breath is affected by your health, and perks (like Iron Will).  \n  \nThis would allow survivors to more easily run and hide, but still add a lot of tension as you hold your breath hoping the killer goes away before you make a loud gasp to breathe again.
You might get climber or something instead :P
This is true for everything. Class, race, anything. Unless you are legitimately number crunching to scrape out that extra 5% dmg - just have fun, you'll be fine.
Jesus Christ so much this. Your phone detracts so much from the experience. Getting lost or losing yourself and engaging with new people is like the defining aspect of burning man.  \n  \nPut your phone away and look up at all the amazing ppl all around you!

It appears with all the other threads about, the current implementation is making queue sniping very easy.
Use a jockey box mate. Been using one for 2 years now. Just add ice every other day (sometimes last 3) - it's the size of a cooler. With dry ice I'm sure you could make it last way longer.

Think of it like a potluck. Everyone made something from scratch to share and you went and got something prepackaged from Safeway.  \n  \n
Headlamp is awesome for camping/hiking. Getting caught on a dark trail with a setting sun is not fun.   \n  \nGoggles would only be useful if you were hiking in a desert/arid/windy area. But believe it or not, ppl do use them outside of burning man so you're not going to recognizable with that.  \n  \nIf you wanted to look more stereotypical burning man, you should venture towards more top hats, steampunk, or sparkle pony look.  \n  \n[one](https://www.google.com/imgres?imgurl=http%3A%2F%2Fcdn.c.photoshelter.com%2Fimg-get2%2FI0000idTLHxnmszc%2Ffit%3D1000x750%2FBurning-Man-Photography-2013-Cargo-Cult-Portrait-Top-Hat.jpg&imgrefurl=http%3A%2F%2Fpeterossphoto.photoshelter.com%2Fimage%2FI0000idTLHxnmszc&docid=y3cNjH2kn5clyM&tbnid=wKKFGCxNShMi5M%3A&w=500&h=750&bih=1310&biw=2560&ved=0ahUKEwj9idO8tIbQAhVrrFQKHZlLD3MQMwgfKAEwAQ&iact=mrc&uact=8)\n[two](https://www.google.com/imgres?imgurl=https%3A%2F%2Fs-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com%2F236x%2Ff4%2F00%2Fe8%2Ff400e8354ff5b2b972c9c591f445ff9a.jpg&imgrefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.pinterest.com%2Fpin%2F237987161535797399%2F&docid=dcA-p2Nxj7WmoM&tbnid=6b9_l5HWLBEq7M%3A&w=236&h=314&bih=1310&biw=2560&ved=0ahUKEwj9idO8tIbQAhVrrFQKHZlLD3MQMwguKBAwEA&iact=mrc&uact=8)\n[three](http://journal.burningman.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/bman_9_02-060.jpg)\n[four](https://www.google.com/imgres?imgurl=http%3A%2F%2Fi.dailymail.co.uk%2Fi%2Fpix%2F2014%2F09%2F05%2Farticle-2744421-210F8D6800000578-34_634x795.jpg&imgrefurl=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.dailymail.co.uk%2Ftvshowbiz%2Farticle-2744421%2FWill-Smith-gets-Jiggy-With-It-Segway-parties-Burning-Man.html&docid=9ML95xaEZ1Z59M&tbnid=CFMLfJtYbUj0PM%3A&w=634&h=795&bih=1310&biw=2560&ved=0ahUKEwj9idO8tIbQAhVrrFQKHZlLD3MQMwgpKAswCw&iact=mrc&uact=8)
One my friends lost a front tooth and ripped his lip open 2 years ago with one very similar at the Burn last year.  \n  \nImagine a bunch of people super spaced hanging out in an enclosed area, and then BOOM - blood, screaming, and confusion.  \n  \nHe earned his name 'SLAPSHOT'
Sucks that killer wasted that memento mori for two people too.
Always sad to see Art Cars go for sale.  \n  \nI get that the artist wants to recoup some of the investment, but I can't imagine someone paying 50K to drive around someone's else's work/art out there. Seems so very wrong, like plug and play for self expression.
\nFeature not bug
I work with one of the camps listed here. He played last year and we all feared the worst, but he actually didn't get on the mic almost at all.   \n  \nThe BRC Weekly last year had a pretty hilarious article mentioning him: http://brcweekly.com/BRCWeekly2015_ext.pdf. He said something to effect of "I know the stigma of big name DJs at Burning Man, and I'm going to change that." I don't know if he's quite there yet, but I believe some of the talk did affect him enough to want to change.
Get on! We need ppl in the queue! To hunt!
No, I can't save anyone from ruining their own good time. What I said was that it would detract from their experience, not mine. There are ppl glued to their phones sprinkled out there - I do not feel the need to sneer, I do not hate them. I pity their isolation in the middle of the best gathering of people in the world.    \n  \nAnd no, I'm not going to judge you for your LED set up. I myself work on an art car where I helped design our lighting system. It's a network of teensys connected to a raspberryPi via radio control, with the rPi broadcasting a local webpage over wifi. You connect to the wifi, get an interface to control the lights, and start pressing buttons. We usually have a dedicated device (like a cheap kindle fire) that's connected to it. While it's a technology device, it's not connected to the internet or personalized for me to receive messages, or really distract me beyond hitting a button to change the lights - so I don't find it detracts from my experience since it does not link me to the outside world. Sounds like your set up would be similar, if you can resist the urge to do more with your phone.\n  \n
No amount of perks can stop survivors destroying traps and hooks. Also, my Wraith is higher than my Trapper.
You get points for struggling as well. Maybe they should add 'Distraction' points if the killer is camping you too.
Trapper is getting hard to main, it seems every game there are at least 2 people who have sabotage. You will end most maps with no traps left in the game.

I think I will drop the 3d modeling requirements, I should be utilizing my desktop for that, best not to let it go to waste. Is there anything like the acer aspire e15 but with an SSD and 8GB ram, or is that not worth it? 
I wish it were as easy as paying someone to homebrew to brew for you, but that's actually illegal and requires a license. Like nearly every (all?) markets, it's not actually a free market once you get the government regulation involved.
He's a great man doing great things, but bringing something to market is not the same as inventing it. And you're still giving him credit for doing something that hasn't actually happened yet.  So no entity has done it prior, or even now. Google and Tesla face this same hurdle. Google might not sell cars, but they will certainly be selling their software which could be vastly superior for all we know.  \n  \n\n  \nAs for Mars, I've heard about a hundred times in the past two decades that we're only a few years off... you'd think /r/Futurology would be a little more cautious in their claims when the top comment is always why 'amazing new thing xxx' is actually not even close to reality.

There's no perks that stop sabotaging, but you're right about the add-on's. I'm curious what he used as well, I've never used anything that seemed very effective.
You're looking for insidious. After 6-4-3 sec (depending on rank) of standing still you go 'stealthy' and your terror radius is reduced to 0. \n\nPretty freaking amazing actually.

If you aren't using your child theme, why just not include it? Sounds like something is misconfigured with your child-theme: https://codex.wordpress.org/Child_Themes
It's different. No one walks into your house and thinks you painted your art unless you're a painter. If you're at burning man, the natural assumption is that you made you art/art car.
Because your tiny computer is so much more than a paper guide book?  \n  \nA guidebook you open, you read, you put away.   \nA phone can take pictures, make calls, get text messages, use all sorts of apps, and 'oh hey I got a message from my friend at home! she wants me to send a picture! Maybe I'll post this on facebook!'    \n  \nIt is an anchor to default world, and I truly believe you would have a much better experience by unburdening yourself.

You're saying I don't do enough, and I can tell you're just agitating me.  What are you doing besides being a provocateur?\n\nAnswer my question, asshole.  What kind of lawyer spends all this time shaming libertarians on reddit?   
I tend toward ancap, but to be factually accurate:\n\n>[The use of the word libertarian](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libertarianism) to describe a new set of political positions has been traced to the French cognate, libertaire, coined in a letter French libertarian communist Joseph Déjacque wrote to mutualist Pierre-Joseph Proudhon in 1857
Up vote for solid analysis and obviously an understanding of the situation in Israel/Palestine.  I can't help but feel as though you do have rather rose colored glasses in relation to Israel, however.  \n\nThis really is a very complicated conflict which goes back ages, only to have been made much worse by modern warfare.  Palestine aligning with Hamas is probably the largest criticism I have on their end and Israel ghettoizing the Palestinians is my biggest criticism of them.  I am of the belief that a one state solution seems to be the only one with a long term chance of peace, albeit there won't be any consensus no matter which direction they are to go.  
>I don't see how a privatized justice system wouldn't favor the rich.\n\nMeaning you haven't given privatization enough thought, let alone given it enough credence to try it out.\n\nBut, if you're willing to open your mind: Detroit is one of the worst cities in America for crime, and [The Detroit Threat Managment Center](http://www.threatmanagementcenter.com) founded by Dale Brown.  They are coming in to do what the police refuse to do, go into bad neighborhoods to protect people from predators.  \n\nAs far as helping the poor in Dale Brown's on words: "We provide security services to those who can not afford to pay for free.  The way we do that is through the profit margin afforded to us through providing a quality service to the affluent who we serve so well."  Not only could private security work, it would be better.  If it's not clear enough, look at how public sector police are predatory, they are literally the most powerful gang in America, albeit not monolithic.  As someone who has been caught in the grips of corrupt local law enforcement, I can tell you first hand that the most egregious crimes of gangs are committed under the cover of protected legal status afforded by police unions and the bureaucracy they work under.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=onWC8nNpIco\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2IbjhV00as
We're too busy with private charity, teaching people to be entrepreneurial and starting businesses to "care much about helping people".
I don't think he's a troll.  I think he's just a misinformed statist.  I think it's worth tearing down his argument, because he's saying the same thing any non-libertarian says.\n\nEDIT: Formatting
Hm.  Alright.  I may do that.  I do have to say, I've thrown away about every pamphlet I've ever been given.  I've only ever read ones I picked up on my own volition.
>Trading freedom for security sounds like you're dealing with conservatives more\n\nNah, mostly liberals.  I live in Minnesota.  They are just as willing to give up freedom for security: gun control, high taxation, speech laws, et al.
I do.  I engage people in my personal life.  What else am I suppose to do, short of the *exact* kind of charity and education work?  \n\nI think you're a pompous ass.  If you're a lawyer, what are you doing on reddit shaming libertarians?  Don't you have more important things to do?
Shoot...I just signed up for Bluehost because of the perks offered by an affiliate.  Coincidentally, I'm also creating a site for a podcast.  Since you're fellow Minnesotan, I'll have to check your podcast out, though.  Sounds interesting.  Good luck!
The government where I grew up is corrupt.  Listen to Lions of Liberty next Friday, I talk about my story with criminal justice and just how terrible local government can be.
>Not a stretch, you're doing it right now by implying giving to this charity is good and not doing so makes you selfish.\n\nThe parent said he's unapologetically selfish and won't contribute.   Giving to charity is good.  Not giving is well within your rights, but if we are to expect voluntary charity to make up for ending the welfare state, we ought to lead by example.  Otherwise, you're just mentally masturbating and statists will not only not take you seriously, but will call you a hypocrite.  The parent gives statists ammo.  Why are you mad at me?  I want to end forced redistribution. 
Stop avoiding my question.  What do you do, besides shame libertarians on the internet?
Jesus christ, you are such an elitist.  Did you stop reading right there?  What do you do that makes you so much better than me?  What are you doing, besides being a lawyer, anyway?  
I'm with you dude.  I keep seeing this talked about, but no links to a source, an explanation or how people know.
Wow, you're a cunt.  Along with the principles of non violence, libertarians believe in personal responsibility, which means showing that we can help people without a coercive enterprise who has a monopoly on violence, litigation and regulation (the state, my dude).
I legitimately don't see how there's a difference.
It's a charity platform created by and largely contributed by libertarians.  What else do you want?  \n\nYou want us flaunting it?  Because that helps libertarians: "HEY LOOK, WE'RE DOING STUFF!!"  
>The left want to impose Sharia law\n\nEven saying that hyperbolically is ridiculous.  I can't stand the left on principle or just dealing with debating them, but come on...
Just doing God's work, my dude.
Oh.  Lolol 
Meh.  It took me all but 5 minutes to type all of those replies.  I don't think it hurts much of anything but my loss of time to tear down their arguments.  Some trolls certainly aren't worth replying to, but at least this was ~20% ideological arguments.
>And who polices the private security\n\nThe courts.  Who polices the police right now?  That's right, the courts who are in collusion *with* the LEOs and prosecutors.  Privatizing the system would at least make them seperate entities.\n\n> The mob, the mafia\n\nExplain to me how the government is not a syndicate.  It extorts.  It robs.  It kills.  And they have a monopoly on all of it, including the litigation and regulation which allegedly put violence in check.\n\nDid you even take the time to look into the links I sent you?\n\nEDIT:  I think we can both at least admit that culture is a major factor here.  The Detroit Threat Management Center only works because the people care and are creating a system which is subversive to the common government security.  The more of those firms are out there competing and keeping public sector policing in check, the better security can become.
You're going to have to back up that claim.\n\nIf this: "According to the 2017 index, the U.S. ranks 17th out of 180 rated economies, lagging behind other comparable advanced economies such as Switzerland (fourth), Australia (fifth), Canada (seventh), and the United Kingdom (12th)" is what you're considering the scale, you're strawmanning.  They name in its comparison the largest economies on the scale that rank higher than us in economic freedom.  If anything, it is a testament to the fact that we have major problems in America if we are *less* economically free than rather socialistic countries.  It's not satirical, but the data does show that it is laughable.\n\n[This](http://www.heritage.org/index/about) is the source.  They are measuring economic freedom itself, not "economic freedom as it relates to socialism".  
>it is only fair to judge private security firms by the worst examples of them\n\n...then I can judge government by the same metrics.\n\nYour perception that privatization can not work is borderline theological.  I don't think private policing will ever become widespread, but you're a fool if you somehow think it's worse than America's system to have more competition from private firms.\n\nAlso, if you're not American, I don't think you can fully appreciate the depth of corruption, down to a local, level that our government legitimizes crime committed by police.  \n\nI'm done replying, I really just wish you could have seen the things that I have seen...public police in America are a protected class of crooks.  I don't see how your answer of "the right people" or "right system" is going to somehow change this.  As a libertarian, I am set out to change culture rather than policy, because even if the government policy I wanted were to happen today, it would all be for nothing if everyone in America had the same notion of governance.  It's all about non-aggression.
It's anarcho-tyranny, bruh.  Hur dur, rights don't matter because we're commencing 1776
I engage people on the principles of non-aggression and voluntary association in my personal life.  Am I not doing enough?\n\nand again:\n\n>What kind of lawyer spends all this time shaming libertarians on reddit? 
Ahh thank you!  It actually was on the DNS within 15 minutes!
"Coercive attitude" huh? I'm not threatening anyone.  
Alright.  I get it. I'm a do-nothing libertarian, who's only out there being the change I want to see.  What are you doing?  You're a lawyer.  So what?  What kind?  What in the actual fuck are you doing besides grandstanding with liberatarians on the internet?  What kind of lawyer sits on reddit shaming a fringe group of people with a particular political philosophy?
Just come out and say it.  That's what you're implying, don't be disingenuous.  \n\nSo you're not going to answer my question.  You're the kind of lawyer who has nothing better to do than shame libertarians on the internet.  
What do you suggest?  I bring it up in conversation and "educate" people on principles, but no, I'm not sitting down and giving them a class.  I don't think people particularly like being evangelized, either.
You're a lawyer who has a troll account shaming libertarians on Reddit.  What else do you do?  \n\nI already answered it.  I run a podcast, just was on a libertarian podcast teaching people about criminal justice, I'm always engaging my people in my personal life about liberty, and I give my money and volunteer my time to charity.  Just because I'm not doing exactly the kind of philanthropic work you want me to, doesn't mean I'm not out there making a difference. 
Yeah...I know.  I just can't stand this guy, he pisses me off.  I fucked up.
It's a stretch to say I'm virtue signaling.  we get blamed for being self absorbed people who don't want to give up any money to those in need.  From a rights perspective, of course I don't believe in redistribution, but promoting voluntary contributions to charity is not virtue signaling.  Why are you so mad?  \n\nEdit: spelling 
You're still not debunking my claim that wealth is elastic with multidimensional metrics.\n\n>my dumbass gullible mate. \n\nAlright, thanks for admitting you have nothing left but an ad hominem.  I won the argument.  Have a nice life.
>So her idea of no fly zones means she wanted war with Russia???\n\nYes.  It's war posturing.\n\n>If that were true, then why did Trump completely flip flop and admit the Russians were involved?\n\nWas he talking about the DNC leaks or the Podesta leaks?  I already admitted they probably were involved in that.  \n\nWhy are you so invested in defending the deep state?
>P.S. if you want to live tax free just go live in the woods and be completely self sufficient. According to you, you don't need public goods anyway, right? \n\nYou're just full of fallacies aren't you?
I meant, "no I'm not answering your question again."\n\nWhat the hell do you do?  Because all I know of you is you're a trash account, going around a libertarian subreddit talking shit.  
Great question.  Two things:\n\n1) Given our role in the end of WW1, the British promised both the Palestinians and Israel the same land to push back the Ottoman Empire and we were allied with the British.  Ipso facto, there's a diplomatic culpability, in conjunction with:\n\n2) There is a major theocratic element to our alliance with Israel, especially in contrast to the Palestinians.  \n\nThe thing is, the conflict is historically based in theology, however it has become something much more than that if someone is being intellectually honest about it.  The Palestinians are considered not legitimate in their claim to the land because they used to be the "Philistines", genealogically Greeks who immigrated to the Mediterranean.  However, in a practical sense their culture and genealogy has changed to Arab over a millennia, they never had a bureaucratic state, and it even goes back to Roman conquest as far as why that is.  \n\nIt really is convoluted and I am no expert, this is just in a nutshell how I understand the history.  I do know this much, we make the situation much worse.  We can be allies without having to subsidize one side or another, or legitimize settlements on either side.  Its a complicated property rights question, simultaneously both and neither have a claim since it is historically contested territory.  Both sides are also guilty of crimes against the other. \n\n*formatting 
>So why do we need a million news topics from "libertarian" sites and half a dozen discussions on this subreddit about it? \n\nBecause it's becoming increasingly more obvious that the alt right is trying persuade libertarians to their toxic ideology.  Obviously if you were to be convinced of their persuasion, you were likely never a principled libertarian but a dejected conservative.
The LP =\\= libertarianism.  
If you don't think libertarians are doing that, then you obviously don't know enough about the movement...
That's not what this is about.  People think that if we didn't have the state to help the downtrodden, everyone would be selfish and people would never be helped.  I posted this to prove people wrong, but idk..given all the downvotes and the fact that this is the highest upvote, maybe liberals are right.  Maybe libertarians are largely selfish ideologues who are not heavily invested in proving the state wrong.  
>So, private police\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=onWC8nNpIco
Cool.  Thanks for proving statists right then.
I think the problem is the framing of the narrative in terms of the Russian interference.  Of course foreign entities are going to try to effect the release of information during the pre-election.  However, the narrative has been framed in a way to make it seem like Russians literally hacked votes, which is impossible, being as Diebolt machines are on intranets.  You can especially sympathize with the Russians when the Democratic Party nominee was posturing to bomb the shit out of your troops.  You don't think America would do the same thing, if threatened?\n\nAnother thing to note, is that it is pretty widely known that a DNC insider leaked the e-mails on the Clinton nomination, even though the liberal media had pigeon holed the Russians into that situation as well.  \n\nTL;DR - The Russians didn't literally manipulate votes.  If the worst thing they did was release *true* information, people have no ground to stand on in the face of all of the manipulation of foreign countries (including unabashedly assassinating people we don't like).
I'll tell you what.  like I said, I can't pass up the perks of singing up with this Bluehost affiliate.  However, given my worldview, I really do want to help small businesses, so I will definitely seek out someone like yourself after the year is up.\n\nHere's my concern: I don't understand exactly the role of hosting in relation to the site building services (looks like Bluehost uses wordpress).  Is that the major part of hosting itself, then?\n\nAlso, lets say I do leave Bluehost after a year.  How easy is it to take my site and go over to you?
>BLM people say whites are "subhuman"\n\nI have no doubt that there are people in BLM who are racist, and I vehemently disagree with them in their shortsightedness, blaming everything on racism.  However, I don't think that's the consensus.  
https://youtu.be/h_D3VFfhvs4
You've missed the point. The fact is that there was plenty of shit SNL could've used to fuck with Obama and they, time and again, chose not to. Probably not a coincidence.
@ 30:25 - With a smug look on his face, he says "well if he was a *real* economist, he wouldn't even be that good because he's a dummy."  hahahahaha, its like he spent days coming up with that one and really thought he was sticking it to him.  That guy is an annoying bumbling idiot, all he does is interrupt with some cockamamie uninformed populist pandering to protectionists. \n\n@ 47:00 - "This is a question of the constitutionality, and I'm not an attorney but it says 'general welfare right here in plain ink."  http://www.dailykos.com/story/2014/11/2/1340978/-America-s-Misunderstood-Mission-Promoting-the-general-Welfare  "therefore, congress and the president have done this for the general welfare of the people because they're nice, and that's why we have them, because the state loves poor people."  Even if it were true that the government did this out of genuine concern for the downtrodden rather than special interests via labor unions in the state's pocket, why does it justify continuing it if it has empirically hurt the poor and minority population in this country?\n\nWilliams wins the argument.  Not only are his opponents wholly uninformed, but their point appeal to authority and emotion.  Not to mention, the burden of proof lies in the history that we've trended since the 80's.  \n\nEDIT: I'll also mention that the biggest shame about this video is that his opponents weren't even armed with strong arguments.  
I have a rudimentary understanding that Bluehost has backup services and whatnot.  Well, I appreciate you talking to me, you may have won yourself a customer in a year!
Okay, well Spencer has taken credit for coining it.  I don't think it actually matters enough to even try to prove one of us right or wrong.
Yeah.  I just recorded a podcast yesterday with a libertarian show talking about criminal justice.  I run my own podcast where I talk about art and culture while working in my message.\n\nWhat are you doing?  Trolling around a libertarian subreddit on a trash account?
>What principles are you trying to impart?\n\nIndividual sovereignty and human interaction is to be voluntary, never initiated by force.  The use of force against peaceful people's is justification for self defense, that is the only time violence is legitimate and lawful.\n\n>why do you think it didn't stick? \n\n<\\shrugs> Statists gonna state.  Everyone loves the idea of trading freedom for security.  No one wants to admit that the trade off is often more of a burden than the benefit.
I do it all the time, even with my partisans friends.  They get so enamored when I talk about their enemies, softens their shell, then I hit them with ways their team does the same thing.  I think my close friends are tired of me saying that there's a non-partisan deep state that is pulling the strings, and that the war state should be everyone's enemy rather than the political theater they are emotionally invested in.  Never seem to actually get any of them to sustain the principles I'm trying to teach them, if anything they just avoid politics with me -_- 
So I don't do enough.  Got it.\n\nWhat kind of lawyer spends all this time shaming libertarians on Reddit?  
>So Trump wants war with Russia as well since he has proposed the same thing?\n\nDoes Trump want to overthrow Assad?  If so, he is also posturing for war with Russia.  Let's also mention the hawkishness on Iran which is contrary to the whole "Putin-Trump" BS, so I certainly do see a concern with his foreign policy because it is not anything like those who said he was a non-interventionist.
>The problem, of course, being that if the palestinians are integrated into the Israeli population, they would shortly vote for more and more radical Islamic laws until Israel became another muslim majority state where all non-muslims are second class citizens forced to obey muslim law. \n\nFrom my understanding, Palestinians are some of the least theocratic Muslims in the Middle East.  Have I been mislead, there?  I have fundamental problems with Islam (mostly because I'm an anti-theist, so I take issue with every theology), but it seems like it may be a reach to see them as the same as Afghani or Jordanian people.
DonorSee was founded by and is ran by libertarians...
> We do need national laws to govern 370 million people\n\nBecause that's worked out so well.  /s\n\nWe need more nullification, the 10th Amendment is the tool Federalists envisioned the state's would use to keep the federal government small.\n\n>it can't just be random local laws defining little islands of reality\n\nHaving more control in smaller jurisdictions = closer to individual sovereignty.  That doesn't mean we are segregating people into islands.  See: the market.
Well, someone else I was talking to recommended buying my domain separate from the hosting company.  Their logic makes sense, your hosting company could change on a dime and your domain could be held hostage.\n\nAlso, I'd like to give you a chance to sell me on your service.  To be candid, I think I am going to go with Blue host only for a year, if only to get the perks.  Then, if I'm not satisfied with my service, which a lot of people have expressed just that, I may very well not renew and I'm willing to consider another provider
Coping out of the debate by saying [you can always leave ](https://youtu.be/fasTSY-dB-s) means you've lost the debate.

>#INDIVIDUALLIVESMATTER*\n\nIt wasn't misspelled.  Not sure what that's all about 
Old and a repost.  I've had r/funny mod my original posts for reposting from social media, even though it was just from my own FB page...
After this conflict with Richard Spencer and Jeffery Tucker, I think it's glaringly obvious that there's a riff in libertarianism.  I've thrown around the idea of guest writing an article on how deeply troubled the libertarian movement has always been with in-fighting, but I'm just too busy right now.  However, given the advent of the alt-right, we're seeing a lot of libertarians being overly-sympathetic to their platform.  What's more is that if you say anything against members of the alt-right, you're called a "cuck", "SJW", or "libtard", despite how invested you are in elements of right-libertarianism such as Austrian school of economics, market separatism, or voluntarism. We also can't forget that a large majority of the alt-right are former Ron Paul libertarians and paleo-conservatives.  I'll also mention that Hans Hoppe is a big part of this.  Long has libertarian thinkers warned of the slippery slope that Hoppe's literature implies, not to say that he is not relevant or brilliant, I even think there's elements of principle to "physical removal" but it has been taken out of context and used to suit a narrative which is antithetical to liberty.\n\n*formatting
Don't be disingenuous, most libertarians aren't as worried about consumption taxes.  We simply want those who provide those services to be accountable.  The income tax is extortion at best, theft at worst.\n\nKinda funny how when schools start running out of money they become much more accountable and approach the budget from a market standpoint.  
Damn this comment section blew up.  I haven't even looked yet and I don't know if I want to, but I imagine it looks like Europe circa 1945
>How much of the profits would you want?\n\nWhatever the market dictates it needs to provide said service.
Roads, which are not funded by income taxes but rather fuel taxes, are not on the top of my list of concerns.  I'm more worried about my federal tax money being used as leverage to enforce edicts on my state, funding my own subversion, or used to murder brown people 6000 miles away...
I'm willing to come together with you in going toward liberty of you'd like.  But in fighting on the internet is much to the delight of authoritarians.
>so unless the DNC or GOP start killing people\n\nOh, please.  The *only* thing they can agree to do is kill brown people 6000 miles away and tax us (at the barrel of a gun) or print money to do so, which only further perpetuates our poverty problem which kills people domestically.  Not to mention, the state gives police a pass on the criminal code to rob and kill people.
>No one was or is posturing for war with Russia.\n\nHave you not been paying attention to what McCain, Graham and the other neo-cons are saying?  http://www.ronpaullibertyreport.com/archives/warmongers-in-congress-introduce-bill-to-prevent-trump-from-loosening-sanctions-on-russia\n\nOf course Clinton didn't come right out and say we were going to get into a hot war with Russia, but even WaPo admits her Syria policy was absolutely going to escalate conflicts.   https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/25/hillary-clinton-syria-no-fly-zones-russia-us-war\n\nWe also positioned Troops in Poland just before Obama left office.  Also odd to note that we backed out of East Aleppo right after Nov 8th, as if the administration was pulling back given the new paradigm shift since they were expecting a new administration.\n\n>It's barely even claimed, and zero evidence has been provided.\n\nThe fact is the IC doesn't have any evidence either.  It's speculation on both sides and my logic and reasoning tells me that Murray is more believable than the IC.  I don't doubt that the Russians were involved in the Podesta leaks.  I welcome it, in fact.  If it's Russia hacking us and exposing the truth, let the chips fall where they may.  But that's a far cry from saying they "hacked the election."  I understand that the use of "hacked" is more or less slang, but lets not pretend it wasn't suiting a narrative.  "Let's talk about the Russians to avoid the *truth* which they exposed.\n\nAgain:  We do this shit to other nations.  all. the fucking. time. \n\n>"President-elect Donald Trump accepts the U.S. intelligence community's conclusion that Russia engaged in cyber attacks during the U.S. presidential election and may take action in response, his incoming chief of staff said on Sunday."\n\nAnd that conflicts with anything I'm saying, why?
>Utopia a dream\n\nGood thing we aren't selling a utopia.\n\n>toll roads\n\nmuh roads\n\n
That doesn't prove that wealth is a fixed pie...that proves what we already know, that the rich are, in fact, wealthy.
If I could also shamelessly plug, since you mentioned you're a podcast consumer: www.facebook.com/subversionwebcast and you can also find it on iTunes.  \n\nIf you end up listening, I would appreciate any critique or feedback.\n\nEDIT: I will also consider give you my business.  The only thing keeping me on the fence is the Bluehost affiliate who gives you publicity for going through them...I understand that you just said it may be unlikely that it will benefit me, but it certainly sounds like it may help me.  I may consider only signing on for the first year for the perks then switching after that year if I don't like it.
>Obama was weak on Russia, after all\n\nWhat, the sanctions didn't go far enough and we weren't aggressive enough in overthrowing Assad?  gtfo.  This mother fucker laid down and let the intelligence agencies/Pentagon be completely autonomous.  How you could see him as "weak" on Russia is beyond me.
Thanks friend!\n\nCan I ask you a few more questions about web hosting, since you're in the biz?
He got downvoted because he's always trolling this sub, looking down his nose at libertarians for not doing what he wants is to do...even though there are plenty of libertarian charities, we are just a small movement, so they're not widely publicized or anything.
I'm sorry? What are you talking about?
You're taking this too seriously.
Lol.  "Muh private prisons."\n\nYou do realize most of the federal and state private prisons that are around now were created to meet the demand created by the drug war, right?  What conduit do private prisons use to fill their beds?  They can't sustain themselves without the state.  The DEA, DOJ, and FDA are the best friends of private prisons, get a clue.\n\nPlus, they are a minority in the incarceration business.  You know who is really "profiting"?  Guard unions.  If you cash a check for doing something immoral, you are profiting off of it.  The public sector profits too.  Or are you so fooled that you think the public sector = philanthropic angels that are just there to help?
I really don't see how you don't trust people to organize security without it being monopolized...they are the same people, doing the same thing.  The American government does not police itself.\n\nI'll say it again.  Police forces are literally the most powerful gang in America.  In 2014, they took more from people in civil asset forfeiture than all burglars did.  \n\nHave you ever been followed around town by police, blatantly taking note of where you are and who you are associating with?  Have you ever been pulled over on a regular basis by your local police, searching your car for drugs until they get an arrest on you?  Sure, they were restrained by """"the law"""", but barely.  Have you ever seen people get set up to get busted in "drug free" zones?  Have you ever seen your friends house get raided by a swat team because a nosey cop looked in his windows without a warrant?  Have you ever seen your friend get beaten half to death just for being a bit annoying?  Have you ever seen your sister put in handcuffs and drug by said handcuffs and thrown into a police car?  Have you ever seen a gang of 6 cops, weapons drawn on a scrawny, effeminate hippy for having two grams of weed?  Have you ever had your garbage stolen off of your curb to obtain a warrant, when you know there was no paraphernalia in there to justify said warrant?  \n\nI have seen all of those things.  Yeah, you can brush it off as an anecdote, but know this, these motherfuckers are no different than a gang banger.  Don't let the slick suit and a badge fool you.  And by the way, half of my family are police officers.  I know inside and out how corrupt the criminal justice system is and you have had the privilege of living in a place where you may not have had to see the dark side of it.
>First, when did Clinton threaten to bomb Russians?\n\nWell that was flippant, she was certainly posturing for war with them, however.\n\n>Second, who is saying the Russians hacked voting machines?\n\nThe day after the election, NYT posted an article about "Election Hacking" with a picture of voting machines and were weaseling around the truth to make it seem like the Russians literally hacked the voting system itself.  Several liberal friends of mine and people on twitter were going crazy, believing that Russians directly interfered with votes.  I've listened to Craig Murray on several outlets with a consistent story about meeting a DNC insider who was a Sanders supporter who was disgruntled.  Given Murray's conviction and the fact that it is much more plausible that his story is true than "muh Russians did it".  I take his word over the word of the IC who lie for a living and have a clearly politicized agenda. \n\n>Further, why would Trump completely flip-flop and finally admit the Russians did it, if it's widely known a DNC insider did it? \n\nAre you sure he was talking about the DNC leaks and not the Podesta e-mail leaks?
There's literally no moderation in this sub...
Yeah, I do expect libertarians to be making a difference if we believe in voluntarism.  What about this is so terrible?  People are victims to circumstance, we believe as libertarians a state doesn't exist to right wrongs of said circumstance.  Nowhere am I saying that you HAVE to give to this or any other charity, simply that saying "I'm unapologetically selfish with my money" falls right into the caricature statists paint us in.\n\nNo wonder we can't get anything done.  Here we are, fighting on Reddit.  Im a market separatist at best and an abolitionist at my extreme and you're here telling me I'm a bad guy because I advocate private charity and think it hurts the message to outright brag that you're not going to contribute because you're selfish.  This is absolutely absurd.
I trust Greg Glyer and his charity platform.  You have a good point, though.
Wait, isn't that...hate speech?
&gt;So assuming these people are using violence to enforce the law and there is no other way to enforce the law what stops them from using violence for other things?\n\nLet's be clear, I'm talking about organizing competition to the police by creating private security firms that actually protect people (like the Detroit Threat Management Center), including from tyrannical centralized police.  I'm not talking about immediate public divestment of all police forces to be sold to Sygenta or something.
>(do you REALLY want Republicans using your taxes to blow up brown people or control what people are allowed to say?) \n\nThis is where my wheel gets stuck on a rock in your outgroup thing.  I can't make it through that point very long before I go back to how there really is no difference between liberals and conservatives, *especially* on foreign policy.  It's about the only thing they have bipartisan support for across the board.
Funny you should ask.  I work with a feline rescue and just this week I signed up to do a mentor program for inner city kids in Minneapolis.  I also routinely donate money to charity.\n\nWhat are you doing?  Besides shaming libertarians on Reddit?
Such is the way of the media.  Still, it's a self identified term, it's not like it was a manufactured word like "capitalism".
You do know that Richard Spencer himself coined the term alt-right, don't you?
No, I've already answered your question, I do plenty.  What do you do to help make the world a better place besides shaming libertarians on Reddit?
Go ahead, I'm listening.  What issue do you take with his statement, exactly?
Yeah, that's the silver lining, the dems got taken out of their stupor.  I only wish it were sustainable, but I'm not convinced for a minute that partisan loyalists on either side understand the irony.
"Make the sand glow!"
>So what?  The police want to arrest someone and he pays a private security company and then there is a gun fight?  What you are advocating is basically abandoning the rule of law.\n\nBecause police care so much about the rule of law?\n\n>And guess what?  Private security firms protecting people from the government has been tried plenty of times.  It is called civil war, and it ends up with whoever wins becoming the government and doing the same crap as the previous government was doing if not worse.\n\nJust replace people waging civil war with the drug war and the police have waged one on its own citizens.  It's self defense.
Well, it can be resolved.  We can segregate based on  shared values, but a statist gonna state.

Such a well-written theme. You can hear the danger and menace, but you can also hear the hope. Amazing.

That's only the real issue if you're an idiot who doesn't understand rudimentary economics.
Let me help you.\n\nYou made the following claim: *"People who debate line by line like this instead of having a discussion are wrong 90% of the time."*\n\nMy *"Prove it"* was just shorthand for asking you to prove that claim (or at least provide some evidence to corroborate it), because it prima facie struck me as absolute bullshit pulled straight out of your ass. \n\nYou responded that, *"We've already had a pretty in depth conversation about it. Feel free to scroll down and read it."*\n\nI said I'd done so and that it offered no evidence for your original nonsense claim.\n\nYou then asked, *"How do you prove an opinion that you argue like an idiot/asshole in a totally non-constructive way?,"* and said, *"It's subjective. "Prove it" really proves my point though."*\n\nCall it an opinion, call it a claim, but semantics aside, evidence can be marshaled to support it and you either won't or can't. I suspected the latter, and that's what I meant when I then said that your statement, *"It's subjective,"* proved my point, which was that that's a cop out and you can't prove (provide evidence or support for) your original drivel.\n\nFurthermore, you just indirectly said, by way of a question, that I *"argue like an idiot/asshole in a totally non-constructive way,"* when I didn't do that at all, not even a little bit. You, however, went about arguing against the person and the method of argument, as opposed to arguing against the arguments. But somehow I'm the asshole who's not being constructive, and you're Daniel Webster. Fuck that and fuck you.
You're a bigot.
"Modern history" has different meanings, so you'd actually have to clarify a bit more. If you mean just the 20th century, I'd say Reagan wasn't one of the worst in that case either. Harding, Nixon, Ford, and Carter maybe, but Reagan? Not so much.
Of course it's possible to hate Israel and not Jews, but those two hatreds collide far more often than they don't.
Sure it is. It's also my opinion that water is wet.

>Fair enough, but people seem to think that the US is somehow going in a purely socialistic direction and that's a little far fetched.\n\nI agree that the US isn't "going in a purely socialistic direction" ("purely," though, being the operative word there). The US has, however, been moving in a socialistic direction basically since the founding and particularly post-Civil War.\n\n>People want social change, it's evident and why you see that word a lot lately.\n\nThat depends entirely upon what sort of "social change" about which we're talking. Not all social change is good and, as a general rule, change for its own sake is almost always bad. That said, I agree with your overarching point here.\n\n>We could never be purely socialistic, but people are beginning get to see the value in it and are simply suggesting we move in a more socialistic direction.\n\nI agree that, "[w]e could never be purely socialistic," as I think it's obvious to most people that pure socialism runs counter to human nature. I am curious, though, as to what you mean when you say that "people are beginning get [sic] to see the value in it." Do you mean the value in socialism? If so, to what people are you referring, and what value do you perceive these people to be seeing?
That the ones doing the ridiculing are biased and likely have an ideological agenda.\n\nAlso, they didn't so much make fun of Obama as humble-brag on his behalf.\n\nDownvoting because you disagree or because I'm off-topic? The latter is what downvoting is for, the former isn't.

Not knowing about one fact of the man's presidency doesn't mean I'm ignorant of the rest of it. Also, claiming Reagan was our worst president ignores men like Buchanan, Pierce, and Andrew Johnson - it's just a silly claim.

> Perhaps you missed the "Bubble" skit or a dozen or more skits poking fun at Obama.\n\n"Bubble" skit wasn't about Obama. Citation needed for the *"dozen or more skits poking fun at Obama."*
It's everything /u/ZeeGeeBoo said, plus they've gotten a bit too political for a sports network, which has turned a lot of people off as well.
You talk at me like I'm some huge fan of Trump. I'm not, but it clearly soothes your superiority complex to think I am, so you do you.\n\nAll those things he said are just his opinion. He's hardly alone. If giving your opinion about a television show counts as being a pissy little bitch, then the whole of /r/television falls squarely into that category.

All the most meaningful mistakes took place before Reagan was elected and all the most meaningful negotiations took place after Reagan was elected. Given what a hot-button issue it was during that presidential campaign, I'm sure that the president-elect had nothing to say or do with what occurred.

That's the most ridiculous thing I've ever seen written on Reddit, and that's saying something. Nothing you've said here is even remotely true and none of it bears any resemblance to reality. I don't know what planet you're living on, but it's not Earth.\n\n>I think the history of humanity strongly disagrees. There aren't any examples of this being a functional strategy, ever.\n\nQuite to the contrary. History is filed to the brim with examples. Have you ever read a history book?\n\n>Nobody would have bothered to write 'thou shalt not kill' if we could just encourage people to make better choices.\n\nWriting that is encouraging people to make better choices. It's an extreme example, but it's still an encouragement towards better choices.\n\n>People will always kill and steal if the conditions call for it.\n\nAlways? What conditions? Are you trolling me here?\n\n>The only way to change that is to change the conditions people live in.\n\nPeople can change their own conditions by making better choices.
I'm not a conservative. But if it helps soothe your superiority complex to think I am, well, then, you do you.
I do now. A rare misstep from the Gipper. Thanks for the info.
That depends on what you mean by "true socialism," as socialists have modified the meaning of the term and moved the goalposts any time socialism has been tried and had negative consequences.\n\nStill, whatever meaning one chooses, much, much closer approximations of "true socialism" have been tried many more times in the formation and running of governments than libertarianism.
I guess kinda. Not a terrible example, but not exactly ideal either.
>It's subjective.\n\nAnd that proves mine. Thanks.\n\nP.S. Ad hominem isn't exactly constructive either, but my guess is you don't worry much over your hypocrisy.
Well, I guess I have to disagree here too. I mean, if all we had was happiness, how would we know we were happy? Just like if all we had was suffering and loss, how would we know we were experiencing suffering and loss?\n\nBarring any third-party perspective, would you know you lived a world that was always dark if you had never seen light? You have to experience both to have an accurate impression of the other, don't you?

Do you lie like that all the time or just on Reddit? I guess just try not to be so dishonest everywhere in your life.\n\n> Man why does that sound so familiar?\n\nMaybe because it went on so much for the last eight years?
Prove it.
You are not entitled to anything simply because you're alive.
Okay.
>Pretty sure the consensus here is that you are the liar.\n\nA few hardcore leftist authoritarians and statists on /r/videos doesn't represent a consensus anywhere.\n\n>while mine has been clearly shown through basic history resources.\n\nNo, it really hasn't, but your brain is addled by a political position the highest value of which is to control other people, so, of course you'd think that.\n\nI guess I should've included this little piece of advice before: to thine own self be true. Stop lying to yourself, you fucking maniac.

If someone was constantly making fun of you in such a public way, would it be okay to defend yourself? Is it possible he just doesn't want to take their shit lying down?
If someone is looking for a low calorie cake, they're doing cake wrong.
I have as much empathy and sympathy for my fellow man as anyone, but there's really no getting around the fact that everything begins with choice. Even when all options seem or are bad, choice remains. Is that harsh? Maybe, but I don't think anyone can deny the truth of it.
Shouldn't that be the problem of those who choose to use them? Why must there be a law/regulation/ordinance?
I will get downvoted to shit for this, but here goes:\n\nMost social ills could be remedied simply by individuals making better choices.
They do have a way out and claiming they don't is the worst sort of lie. Actual slaves really didn't have a way out - it was work or die. So-called "wage slaves" won't be murdered by their employer if they leave. We should really stop with all this persuasive redefinition (which is just a euphemism for something truly pernicious).
Sure he did. Guy was as narcissistic as they come and couldn't string together a sentence without about a half-dozen "uh"'s. Plenty of the policies that came out of his administration were laughable. If they really wanted to make fun of him, it wouldn't have been that hard. The point is they didn't really want to. They have a viewpoint - what's the harm in pointing that out?
>Reagan's deregulation directly contributed to the 2008 financial crisis.\n\nI dare you to prove that claim.\n\n>Apartheid. AIDS.\n\nWhat about them?\n\n>He took credit from Carter for the Iran Hostage Crisis...\n\nCarter bungled it and Reagan's election likely sped things up and/or helped the US's position. Even the most left-leaning academics accept this.
Only people who have never picked up a history book think that.
I did and not a lick of it is proof of your claim.

>Questioning power and social norms is what comedians do\n\nIt is? I thought they told jokes in an attempt to make people laugh?\n\n>(whose main traits include rampant anti-intellectualism and chauvinistic nationalism)\n\nAnti-intellectualism (or, maybe more accurately, pseudo-intellectualism) is just as rampant on the left and, worse, there appears to be a growing tendency towards violence against those with whom they disagree. "Chauvinistic nationalism" is like saying "wet water," but that aside, I think it's power and place in the modern conservative movement has been vastly overblown.\n\n>If the right got back to the intellectual conservatism of George Will, David Brooks, Milton Friedman, William F Buckley, etc. then I think they'd get a much fairer shake in terms of comedy. \n\nThat's a lie, and you know it. Or maybe you don't. In the heyday of those conservatives, comedians weren't giving them or, more pertinently, conservative politicians of the time a fair shake. The way it is now is the way it's been for a long time.\n\nAlso, David Brooks isn't an intellectual or a conservative. Just saying.
That doesn't make sense. One's susceptibility to mockery has nothing at all to do with one's ability to do or accomplish something.\n\nAnyway, I think the fact that he's being mocked actually works to his favor, because of who is mocking him. I never quite liked Trump and I certainly didn't vote for him, but since lots of people who I consider to be complete assholes and utter pieces of shit don't like him and/or are mocking him, I now view him in a much better light and it makes me think he was, while not the best choice, better than the alternative.
I'm working.
There has never been a libertarian government tried ever.

How do we know angry lady is telling the truth?
You made a claim that, if you had the ability or inclination, could be proven or disproven. Evidence **could** be marshaled in support of it. Would it be difficult and time-consuming? Maybe, but that doesn't mean it's impossible.\n\nAlso, my saying *"Fuck you and fuck that"* now, after **you** introduced the ad hom is just me defending myself, fighting fire with fire, as it were. So, that's not really a point in your favor.
This is absolutely one of my favorite films. I watch it at least twice a year and also whenever it's on television. For all the same cast and crew to come back for another film would be amazing.
There's no trolling going on here. Calling Reagan one of the worst presidents ever ignores tons of history - Democratic presidents prior to and just following the Civil War are prominent examples.

WHY DO I CLICK THIS LINK EVERY TIME?

Technology is already starting to blend with art - you think Shakespeare is a height? Wait till 200 years from now, it'll be like cave paintings.
In Europe, voter ID is absolutely required and immigrants find lower participation rates (in fact, children of immigrants born there aren't even granted citizenship in most nations).\n\n\nAnd I'm willing to bet you that if every black person in America suddenly started voting republican, that the disenfranchisement would start coming from the democrat party. \n\n\nAgain, I think you (like most of everyone) conflates racism with classism.
There's also a theory that continuous lack of space with others makes everyone equally intolerant (ie you begin to hate everyone as people equally).\n\n\nThat may also explain NYC! :D
I agree. Western Europe is not offensive, they just stay off of you, not worth their time. I've seen this before.\n\nThe south USA you get called names, but I've never been pushed or touched, and it seems I meet (ironically) more polite people in the South than anywhere else, but also very vocal racist folks. I've never felt 'in danger' though like you did in the Ukraine.\n\n\nThere's racism everywhere, I just feel the racism in the south in the US is largely frowned upon by other southerners who will apologize for it - I didn't get this in eastern Europe or strangely France.\n\n\nI have no idea why the french countryside.\n
Depends on where you live in the US. New York/California you end up paying about the same (maybe a smidge less), but places like Arizona, Idaho, New Hampshire? Not really.\n\n\nAnd wherever the next developing superpower nation arises, like people came here. Go back to 1950s America and realize how 'unfree' it was compared with today. China is similar to that, so are nations like Russia.\n\nYou also have nations like Australia, Canada, Sweden, Switzerland, and Norway, all of whom are rapidly privatizing/deregulating (well, rapid compared to most developed nations). \n\n\nRemember, we're talking 30+ years away, things change in that time quite a lot.
I just want to point out this:\n\n>The US is great for the extremely wealthy,\n\nIt's backwards. The US has great opportunities to get extremely wealthy, that's why 30% of the world's money rests in the hands of 5% of the world's population.\n\n\nAnd you can move for ideological reasons, but understand: for the top 40-50% of Americans, they have the best life on the planet. There's nothing even comparable. They are the folks who own businesses, vote, and have power in the economy/politics.\n\n\nMost of the folks screaming for socialism in the US are the ones (like many redditors) low income, low mobility, poor personal choice making, entitlement, etc. that blame everyone for why they aren't rich. They don't have much to lose, so why not? This is nothing new, in the 1920/30s, 1960/70s, early 00's (1% marchers), and now. It repeats every 20-30 years and it's always left in ashes once enough of the younger generation starts making any decent income. \n\n\nThe real fact is: very, very few in the US are 'disenfranchised' and being 'dirt poor' in the US is better than being 'dirt poor' in Sweden. Why? They get even more. The only folks who have it worse off are the working class - the lower middle to middle class. And even then, is it 'worse' off? They have more material possessions, but less free time. They get equal or better healthcare, but they pay more for it. They get greater personal freedoms in some areas (gun ownership, freedom of speech, etc) but they also get less in others (abortion, equality under the law, etc).\n\n\nIt's all a mixed bag, one that is allowed by the 'sink or swim' mentality. You can't have great highs without the great lows, it's just the law of nature. America is built off the backs of millions trying and only thousands succeeding, but those who do succeed blow past anyone else in the world and actually drag up the rest who didn't (no joke, look at capital accumulation in the US and the average quality of life - even inside the US it's very regionally dependent on how much wealth is generated).\n\n\n\nThe US is simply great for most of its citizenry. That's why the libertarian party holds so much insane sway for its tiny size - most folks are some varying shade of libertarian (in the global political sense of the word), we call them independents and they account for 43% of the electorate and largely hold pro-individualist with some government help views. Reverse this to Sweden (though this is changing as Sweden is privatizing and deregulating insanely fast in response to their miserable socialist failures of the 70s culminating to the banking crash of the 90s - #1 in OCED to #16 in 20 years!) where the belief that a strong civic (but local, note local, something that is anti-progressive or 'anti left' in the US) government can make everyone else better, if we simply sacrifice the few truly successful - besides, they have great lives anyways.\n\n\nThis sounds good, until you realize that there's no social mobility in Sweden and the Wallenberg family would never survive in the US without intense government protectionism (which they enjoy in Sweden). So, which way do you want it? An easier life with promised mediocrity or a sharp, rough life with no promises where you can fall hard or rise insanely?\n\n\nAs the son of middle eastern immigrants who were dirt poor (living in our car at one point) and now has well over $100k in assets by age 30 - which do you think I'd rather have? I value a hungry stomach, something entitled white european/americans never can understand, and why 'immigrant advantage' exists.
In your own words you just espoused a group-think belief followed immediately by an individualist statement that runs counter-culture to your group.\n\n\nBeing a contrarian is an American thing. Go on the street and start surveying Trump supports about illegal immigrants.\n\nFirst start off with: "do you support illegal immigration?" And "do we spend too much on illegal immigrants?"\n\nThen ask "do you think illegal immigrant children should be denied emergency medical care?"\n\nOr "do you think illegal immigrant children, who were born in the US and are now 16 in American schools should be allowed to earn citizenship and finish school?"\n\n\nSuddenly, you'll find out of work rust belt white people who literally say 'they terk our jerbs' saying it's okay to spend money for medicine and schooling on illegal immigrants.\n\n\n\nAmerica is a weird ass place. Probably why it's so successful.
>  But it's still assigning a portion of the total wealth.\n\nThis is a false assumption in economics. One that we tackled when I majored in it. Wealth is not a 0 sum game, nor is it a 'scaled' game. If Bill Gates suddenly gets 1000000000000000000000000 more 'dollars', does that mean the minimum wage spikes up to $105 overnight? And that food becomes more expensive?\n\nThe thing is that currency and wealth aren't one, and they are loosely tied. But wealth does not dictate the cost of goods or services. Someone who has $100 vs. $1,000,000 will likely still spend the same amount for a can of coke. The billionaire doesn't order 'coke premiums' for $100 a can. The government can print a lot more $100 bills and make that can $100, but the cost of everything rises equally (inflation).\n\nIt's a logical fallacy to assume that a cook, whose wage is (for argument's sake) is $7.25 will see any increase on pay if wealth triples overnight, but the cost of goods remains the same (which they will). That's why the wealth divide has gotten massive, but the cost of goods has actually fallen over time.\n\n\n> And the point that many are making is that when wealth starts to concentrate, chances are extremely good that someone has their fingers on the scales.\n\nWealth has always concentrated. That's the definition of how capitalism works - a laborer is a 'fixed' capitalist because they are exchanging their time and skill (human capital, which they have a limited amount of both) to earn monetary capital. A capitalist uses monetary capital to earn more monetary capital, and since money doesn't have restrictions, can earn more, faster.\n\nIt's a simple J-curve. The rich today appear richer relative to everyone else - but their wealth has grown at the same exponential function (more or less) it always has. If you have $10 and I have $100 and we both invest in the market at 8% returns equally - how much more money will I have than you in 10 years? In 50 years?\n\nIt'll be more than '10 times', and the inequality will continue to grow. That's what has been happening, technology has made it so that everyone is more productive (hence why software engineers literally roll in cash with a bachelor's/master's degree that was previously only for bankers/wall street guys) so they make more, but the capitalists who backed them are making EVEN more due to it. \n\n\nCaring about concentrations of wealth and inequality are smoke and mirrors shows that people who push an agenda are trying to use. The important factors to economists when talking about human welfare are:\n\n1) the bottom - are the poor getting poorer?\n2) the median wage - what does a majority of the population actually make?\n3) the median wealth - how much total assets does the majority of families have?\n4) Cost of living/bundle of goods - rising costs are never a good thing in society, wages being frozen and costs going down is the 'ideal' scenario, wealth accumulation with minimal inflation or interest\n5) human welfare - do people live longer? are they healthier?\n6) What can the median family afford? Number of cares? Size of house? Times they can eat out? Retirement? Services?\n\nThese are what determines if a society is 'healthy'.\n\n\nOne of the ways to spot a 'sick' economy that is overspent and heading to freefall is when the average worker can't afford the cost of living in a nation. That includes the need for healthcare to be socialized to afford it, because now the average wage of the worker is no longer adequate and the government must institute cost control measures. \n\n\nAnd the second a government institutes a cost control measure/monopoly measures, you officially enter the ticking clock to failure. No government has been successful in sustaining control of necessary services over a long period of time. Healthcare is not a necessary service (you just die if you don't get it, so hard to riot in the street), but fixed gas prices or food rationing goes to shit quite fast. Some last longer than others, but for the most part, if people can't afford their day to day life, you end up in a bad place, super fast.\n\n\nThat's the nuts and bolts of it. It doesn't matter if Bill Gates gets all the 'new' money added to the economy or not to the average person. If the wealth isn't in circulation, it doesn't do anything, positive or negative.
and W Bush was a narrower Obama.\n\n\nDoesn't make what either did right.\n\n\nBut I can see I'm downvote brigading by the virtue signalers. Okay, go on.
Depends on the state.\n\nMany states have laws forbidding specific types of things (dairy, meat), but many don't. Good Samaritan laws protect the stores from food poisoning liability lawsuits on these grounds, and the Emerson act forbids federal prosecution, though state prosecution can still occur if they're dumping things out that have been expressly banned.\n\n\nAlmost every single state allows non-dairy, non-meat to be given away.
Friedman also supports negative income tax/basic income and social security, other things that are clearly unsustainable/not-self-sustaining by their very nature.\n\nBut that isn't to say his thoughts on regional trade (where he won his 'nobel' prize) aren't valid and congruent with Keynes' work - whom FDR also equally ignored.\n\n\nThe great myth is that Keynes favored government control - which he never wrote about or espoused. He considered socialism and communism to be blights upon humanity and even thought social assistance programs had to be work-derived (pay people to build things of value) and that cutting people checks was the fastest way into labor participation eroding to nothing as entitlements continued to grow.\n\n\nIn this case, the Great Depression, if FDR had actually followed the work of JMK, he'd have built mega-projects and battleships starting in the late 30s and pulled the US way out of the depression before WWII via deficit spending.\n\n\nThen post-war, we'd have raised taxes and cut spending, cutting the debt down. That was Keynes' entire plan. Something even Friedman completely agreed with. Something that Hayek, Rothbard, and every major economist who isn't a total shill political hack like Piketty and Krugman would agree on.\n\n\nIt's literally the fundamental use of government as a private exerciser of capital in a mixed-market capitalist economy.
Luddites will luddite. As if our extensive social welfare system isn't already a form of basic income, especially for the elderly.\n\n\nBut, something something socialism makes everything better something something today sucks something something anti-rich.\n\n\nPersonally, I think we're in a damn utopia and I couldn't be happier with how great the world is. We finally have 0 countries on the starving index and the average person in the world has a) internet, b) a cell phone, c) vaccinations, and d) access to clean water and food.\n\n\nTalk about an insane leap from 50 years ago when none of that was true. Life is awesome.

Independent, and I share beers with any American who respects the fact I'm a person, with equal rights, and equal burdens, and will sink or swim on my own merit.\n\n\nI vehemently believe people didn't vote Trump because 'they're racist', just like I don't believe folks voted Sanders because 'they want handouts'.\n\n\nThings are changing and in a nation of 300 million people of all backgrounds, no one solution fits anyone. That's the beauty of states, and it prevents anyone from getting too left behind without a voice (look at the recent election or the one in '08).\n\n\nThe world isn't coming to an end because Trump got elected, and it didn't because Obama did. At the end of the day, most presidents just do what the president did before them but slightly (and I mean *slightly*) different.\n\n\nI've stopped to help push a woman's car out of the snow one day, only to get my own and her's stuck in it.\n\n\nThe first person to stop? A good ol' country farmer who was about 20, driving his truck and proceeded to tow out our cars with a winch. On the back of her bumper sticker said 'Obama 08'. Back of his? Romney '12. He still helped her and gave her his cell phone in case she got stuck again on the way to town.\n\n\nFolks in America are individuals. They like it rough, risky, and want folks to prove themselves first before becoming accepted. Sure, we have issues and there's racists that exist, but I've witnessed old white men who sincerely dislike gays, stand up for a gay man from being harassed by a group of younger white boys in Kansas City MO.\n\nWhy? Because no one harms anyone in *their* town, doesn't matter if they like them or not. That individual responsibility for civic well-being is one of the most powerful things America has and I cringe to think that it might be dying off.\n\n\nIt's the same attitude that put boots on Normandy, and it's the same attitude that made it the superpower.
Money doesn't BUY anything.\n\nIt's the investment. Boarding schools for the poor prove this. When a child is educated and priority is put on success, children achieve. Rich people are rich because they live this, in general.\n\n\nShockingly, they put more overall time and more quality time in, but no more than upper-middle class children. That's why nations like Sweden see no class mobility ever, because the 'state' does it due to their 'superior' education systems.\n\nThere's a reason why US universities fail European rich kids. They aren't imbued with the same sense of personal responsibility because things are *handed* to them there.\n\n\nBeing rich in the US is not as big of a benefit as being rich in Europe is when determining personal success. That just proves its pedigree and you can make a rich family poor, but their kids will succeed more than if you make a poor family rich by wealth redistribution.
if you're pregaming and hipflasking when you go out to bars to drink more, this may be a whole other discussion!
Same here.\n\nI loathed Obama, W Bush slightly more, Trump is on track to quickly pass both of them...but, I'd meet any one of them. If Trump wanted me to sit on some advisory board he has, I'd say yes too. He might kick me out after the first meeting, but I'd still put my hat in the ring to help.\n\nHell, I'd take a bullet for any one of them while they were in office, and believe me, I have no desire to get shot nor do I even agree with a majority of their politics, but they're the duly elected President of the United States, elected by a system set up by some of the wisest government people ever (the Framers) that I believe is the best society humanity has had to date.\n\nSo you bet your ass I'd take any invite that came my way.
Sure, racism is just bias. Just like classism, etc. It's part of what makes us human.\n\n\nBut a rich black man in the US has less issues than a rich black man in Europe or Asia. There's a hint in there on what type of bigotry Americans indulge in the most and it has to do with the color green.
>  Keynes predicted we would only be working 10 hour weeks by now.\n\nKeynes also predicted a government that went to 80% debt of GDP would collapse and running long-term deficits would eventually cause major poverty by constantly crowding out the private market.\n\n\nKeynes, ironically, was a major free market proponent and huge capitalist. His fault is he didn't see the explosion of technology that would give us vastly improved lifestyles, resulting in us needing to continue working hard with more productivity to provide it.\n\n\n\nThe hilarious notion that somehow the rich are 'more rich' than they used to be is just patently false. Carlos Slim is less rich compared to the average American than JD Rockefeller was in his time. By an order of magnitude.
Eh, I think this nation could use a little boots on throats for a while to appreciate liberty.\n\n\nIt seems when talking about misgendering someone, folks forget that freedom means the axe swings both ways. Now, they can enjoy the axe swinging only one way - right on their necks.
> Are you serious? Do you realize all these countries have a significant amount of brown people?\n\nthe US has approximately 15% immigrants by total population, if you count 1st generation Americans (children of immigrants), that number spikes to 40% (as in 1 out of every 3 Americans have had parents that were born elsewhere). If you go to 2nd generation, 88% of the US population is immigrant. (http://www.migrationpolicy.org/article/frequently-requested-statistics-immigrants-and-immigration-united-states)\n\nHispanics and middle easterners (brown people) are over 20% of the population. Blacks encompass 13%, Asians another 5%. \n\nYet, we're the ones with a racist problem? The closest nation next to us is Germany, and mostly they're white (61% slavic or germanic background as of 2014).\n\n\nAlso Barack Obama limited the same travel 4 times in his presidency, up to 7 nations at a time, for 6+ months. Half of Europe has a 'no muslim' ban.\n\nThis is what I'm talking about. The racism is so pervasive in your nation, odds are you don't see it. At least we recognize it exists in the US.
:shocking:\n\n\nBut yes, you are spot on. The US has to either: invoke NATO and go to war with Russia, or dial down NATO and proxy war it back.\n\n\nI'll let history tell you which the US will do.
I don't downvote, actually, almost ever.\n\n\nAnd I never did say I didn't consider it - I simply am stating which is worse. Donald Trump is to European white nationalism as margine is to butter.\n\n\nDoesn't mean there aren't problems, but calling everyone crazy and bullshit when they disagree with your preconceived world view sounds like the exact way a certain woman and her supporters lost an election.\n\n\nMaybe we want to move past that? Huh?
You win.\n\n\nEverything I said was wrong and everything you said was right. Continue promoting a socialist system in America, it won't ever benefit me directly financially and keep the poor down. \n\nAlso, Canadian healthcare is the best, and American healthcare is terrible. Please funnel more money into medicare.\n\n\n\nAt a certain point, I no longer care. You want to give me money while making the system worse off for those who are the most vulnerable? Alright. I voted against it, I spoke against it, but I'll be laughing last with a small percentage of your tax dollars.\n\n\nP.S. you might learn I am not a republican or conservative, and I'm  a consultant for a database company that powers a lot of these industries across nations and I cash big, fat bonus checks off liberal stupidity like my bosses who laugh at how dumb you all are.\n\n\nYes, literally, the owners of the company I work for laugh at how dumb liberals are for funneling them tax payer dollars. So thank you for letting me act morally superior and profiting at the same time.
> 5.56 TSX\n\nCoyotes I get, but a 70g on deer? At 200-250 yards on a deer, you get adequate penetration to one-fell a white-tail?\n\n\nI'd be pretty surprised it would have the power.\n\n
All I know is that folks are very outspoken about it and they let you know that you're not welcome.\n\n\nIt's not something I've experienced in the US or Canada. I have in almost every European nation I've visited with extended stays in (such is the life of travel for work).\n\n\nI will say I don't hardly see much of it in any major city. But I think that's the cosmopolitan effect.
> rVSV-EBOV Was sold to Merck after it passed patient trials\n\n>  has been developed by the Public Health Agency of Canada, with development subsequently taken over by Merck Inc\n\nMerck brought it from a failed trial status in 2014. They modified it and spent $200 million more into the vaccine to make it successful and in Oct of 2015, it passed clinical phase 1 trials.\n\n\nRight in the body. \n\n> Especially single men with no kids. \n\nThat's a myth. You get 2 years of unemployment - that's welfare.\n\n\n> Because Born on the 4th of July documented how we treated our veterans pretty well under conservative management.\n\nI agree. We treat them pretty bad on liberal management, too. The VA is the single largest line item of the DoD budget, by the way.\n\n\n> Was it the 80s you saw these hospitals?\n\nEarly 90s through 2014. Canadian hospitals appear a bit more modern than NHS (though come on, is the bar that high?). Though the German ones I've been in have been the closest to American hospitals. \n\n\nMost of the bad American hospitals I've seen are public, but even those hospitals are superior to the majority - have to remember, we have a massive obesity rate that pushes down our numbers and several population types that are difficult to treat.\n\nIf we took a white male who isn't obese in the US vs Canada vs UK vs Germany vs Sweden - the stats all fall in line closely. Simply put, healthy adults that are 'normalized' to the system (we know all risk factors due to the homogeneity of the population) don't use healthcare much.\n\nIn fact, they get the same outcome with no healthcare often. These help prop up numbers in nations with low minority and low obesity accounts.\n\n\n> They only make less on the exchange rate. Living here gives you greater purchasing power actually even if you consider the exchange rate.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_average_wage\n\nSeriously, folks in the US are stupid rich. I say this as someone who makes $180k on a bachelor's degree.\n\n\n> Also, finally those doctors gave the US and the world the Ebola vaccine.\n\nThirty six failed vaccines came out of Canada in the last year according to the same article. Do we take a credit or a debit for it?
Then I have an idea, let's take all that state tax money and distribute it evenly across America.\n\n\nWe can even set metrics for schools to try to achieve. It'll turn out great.
>  On second point, you write like someone who never been in a real bad spot\n\nI'm the son of immigrants who lived in a car when he was 3. \n\n\nDon't project. We're a heavily regulated capitalist hegemonic republic at the moment with a large socialist movement building in the US. It's actually the fate of a lot of powers that enter a steady state decaying, authoritarian socialist system. Look at the UK for the best example.\n\n\nBut sure, crazy. Yeah, because the US lacks in social programs. Only 68% of all federal taxes go to social payments, I mean, it's not like it's 74% like in the UK. Geez.
No kidding.\n\nI was seriously hoping the democrats would have been able to slow down Trump for 4 years, like they did with Obama the last 4.\n\n\nYeah, things would still get shittier, but at least slower compared to 2000-2004 and again in 2008-2012.
Well, folks in the US are just generally overly polite, too.
I didn't suggest Trump is the only bigot.\n\n\nI literally think HRC is as bigoted as Trump, just smarter about hiding it. But just because she's an elitist shitbag doesn't mean he isn't.
I used to think this was true, too.\n\nLike, you can appear as a sun-tanned outdoors type, but ever since 9/11 there's a lot more focus on what is 'middle eastern' vs. 'tanned white'.\n\n\nAnd sure, a Japanese person in the US will likely experience more racism then in Japan, but Japan is clearly more xenophobic to all non-Japanese than America is too all non-whites.\n\nDoes that mean Japan is 'less racist'? Or more? \n\n\nThe main point I'm making is that there's an individualist culture in the US that isn't present in a lot of other places - meaning, that most people are racist (worldwide) but in the US racism stops at the individual for the most part. Once someone knows you, you become 'one of the good ones'.\n\nIt's unique and I think people need to understand that.
Almost. Health and human services did the office of education part, which oversaw things like the federal Pell Grant and other higher education act (1965) implementations (Title 1 funding for instance).\n\nThe ED's powers have always been in the president's purview, including the ability to mandate curriculum or not receive federal aid money for things like: disabled kids, pell grants, etc. The same way the DoT blocks highway grants to states that don't keep the drinking age at 21.
So, you've never been poor or grown up in an inner city urban all black neighborhood. Thanks for projecting!\n\n\nI'm going to break your little liberal fake world but yes, rich people are literally superior human beings. They mate nearly exclusively with the successful, they align ventures together, they have their own social circles, they have their own schools and academics, own business ventures, even own private clubs.\n\nThey spend more time working out than the average American, they live longer lives, and suffer fewer chronic conditions.\n\n\nAre you somehow dense to what having power and resources, especially intra-generational, bring? \n\n\nIf you are so utterly envious of the rich, you can also look up 'immigrant advantage'. Turns out immigrants to the US generally outperform whites born here.\n\nAlso may shock you: the US generally only accepts the most successful who are willing to migrate, whom themselves probably were doing well for themselves when they left.\n\n*shocking*\n\n> given your ideas of what poorer folk spend their money on\n\nMostly the same things everyone else does. They just have less of it so it eats up a bigger percentage of their incomes.
> Obama's 6 month ban?\n\nYes, actually, I donate regularly to the ACLU who sued him last time.\n\n\nBut, yeah, it does. I don't want to give YOUR cronies power. I see I struck a nerve with liberals.\n\n\nWait 4 years, then I'll strike a nerve with conservatives. You should understand why that's a problem.
Wait. You literally don't know that poor people pay for their own schooling and public schools? \n\n\nHow schools get their money from property taxes, the poor pay in the former rent. That's why schools in poor areas suck.
Well this subreddit is not a safe space, anyone can come here at any time to ask questions, and it is our chance to explain things to people. It's much more efficient of the non-libertarians come here than us having to go everywhere else.
Surveys show that 60% of millennials see the constitution as a bad thing and its removal as a positive step towards socialism.\n\n\nSeriously. That's not a joke, it's literally been beaten into my generation that gov is great, reagan is the devil (despite him being a huge gov person in practice), and the US is the evil empire, so we need to be way more socialist.\n\n\nThat's when you know you live in utter Utopia - everyone is bitching about how bad it is.
I do love me our Asian-Americans.\n\n\nA bit conservative socially, but you guys are alright. Then again, I'm a middle eastern immigrant and arabs loathe the lazy entitled Americans too.
Link to an article that addresses it in a context relevant to this: http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2017/02/19/the-screwed-generation-turns-socialist.html\n\n\nLink to the original article that has the survey which talks specifically about surrender of rights: https://qz.com/848031/harvard-research-suggests-that-an-entire-global-generation-has-lost-faith-in-democracy/\n\n 
Because communism is literally trying to subvert evolution.\n\n\nEvolution is a biological system of survival based on the limits of physics (time, energy, matter).  Capitalism is evolution using money and 'work' in place of violence to achieve its goals.\n\n\nIt's more brutal, actually, because you can enslave others without being near them or putting them in bondage with potential for escape. Not to mention that you can project will/power far beyond the ability to throw a spear or march an army. Thus, more powerful advances are made under it.\n\n\nThe only difference between us today and us 50,000 years ago is that everything we do is at an exponential scale of our effort and ruthlessness.
http://www.ibtimes.com/millennials-wealth-gap-what-do-when-your-friends-are-richer-you-2152434\n\n1/3 of ultra high income earners ($500k+) are under 35, but 90% of millennials do not earn more than $60k (fixed for CoL nationally).\n\n\n\nMillennials and Gen X are doing service/retail/hospitality jobs. It's not just 'kids', we're talking folks up to 50 years of age doing this.\n\n\nhttps://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/mar/07/revealed-30-year-economic-betrayal-dragging-down-generation-y-income\n\n\nIt's not just the US, too. The baby boomers are sucking the system dry at every level, including subsidizing their careers and retirements, so that also doesn't help matters. 
>  US where certain skin color and genders are death sentences \n\nSure, but these are very intense pockets where segregation and homogeneity exists.\n\n\nAlso, Europe is big and diverse too. Though it'd shock you know rape is at double the rate in Sweden as it is in the US. So are hate crimes.\n\nBut the violent crime rate overall is significantly lower (like by x3).\n\n\nIn the US, as a white person, you are less likely to be a victim of a violent hate crime then if you were muslim in Sweden (no joke, look it up).\n\n\nBut, if you are black in the US, you are x26 more times likely to be a victim of regular violent crime.\n\n\nSo we have our own problems, but a lot of them aren't caused by racism, they're caused by poverty and extreme segregation of classes. These spawned out of racism and now that the racism has diminished, these are leftover and have become institutionalized due to classism and cycles of poverty.
Uh. I can tell you they are not fiscally liberal at all.\n\nThey vote democrat because they don't have republicans telling them to their face they are unwelcome.\n\n\nBut hey, you tell me how it is to be an immigrant. I wouldn't know. /s
I know, I know, reddit is full of edgy 14 year olds who think America sucks.\n\nI'm okay with that. And we don't have a popular vote for president - never have. Five president's have lost the popular vote and won - it isn't that uncommon.\n\n\nWe're a federation of states, not a single, central government. That's why winning a plurality of states is necessary to the survival of the *republic*. America was specifically crafted around a mix of the Roman Republic and the liberalism of the European Enlightenment.\n\n\nAnd sure he's a 70 year old billionaire, but he's the duly elected president. While in office, he's the executor of the United States and a symbol. He literally won spending less than any candidate since 2000, as much as people hate him - he's proof you can't buy the system and that the voter's will, including the old farmer in the middle of nowhere, is respected. That it's not just tyranny of the majority or the populous coasts that dictate what life will be like for the rest of the nation that supports the coastal population via agricultural, manufacturing, mining, etc.\n\n\n\nSo there's always some positive that can be found, but any attempt to infringe on the voter's will to execute the office of the president devalues the democratic republic. The second you can change American policy by killing the elected executor, you subvert the will of the voters and the trust of the states.\n\n\nI don't care who the person is, but the office will be protected. Millions of Americans have died in the nation's defense, am I such a special snowflake that I would put myself above that while still enjoying all the benefits those who have sacrificed have given me? Maybe part of the reason why my life is so good is that once in a while we elect crazy backwards presidents (Trump, Nixon, Andrew Jackson, Grant, etc) every so often. \n
Fair enough.\n\n\nBut, out of question, which do you think worse to be in the US: poor or black?\n\n\nI think the US has a classism problem far, far, far, far worse than a racism problem, even if the classism has been spawned by hundreds of years of racism. If that make sense.
I'm honestly in favor of giving free 1st class tickets and 6 month living expenses for folks to surrender US citizenship and move to Europe who want to.\n\n\nThe quicker we depopulate the entitled white middle class with 'Gender Studies' and 'psychology' degrees, the sooner we can get immigrants who want to do real work. Plenty of engineering, software, and medical jobs here guys!\n\n\nCome on over!
I have, and it's 99% drivel. It's why in economics (shocking, I went to school for it), they don't teach it, because it's crap.\n\n\nCapitalism is the defacto system when there's private property with strong legal enforcement of it. Regulated capitalism (aka the capitalism you know) is a system imposed on the natural order of things (raw capitalism) to prevent Caesar's from forming.
> where government schools were small relative to private colleges and universities, and it was not exactly a period of "access" to higher education for most Americans\n\nWe had higher economic growth without even having the public-private cash prize pool system that I am advocating which I think would supercharge things.\n\n> Extending credit to students (not at a subsidy, but at or above cost) is the single thing that will best increase access without distorting the market.\n\nIt is unnecessary and harmful for government to directly perform this process, as it requires government to make centralized decisions concerning the regulation of schools, and for the governmen to perform risk assesment when issuing loans. If the risk assesment process for the issuance of credit is not performed in a competive manner, resources are more likely to be misallocated and economic bubbles will be larger.\n\nOne time cash prizes allow private actors to offer a variety of loans and services to individuals who are attempting to win the prize, and there are many historical examples of this. The Orteig Prize established a modest public prize for the first successful transatlantic flight, and pilot Charles Lindbergh was able to use the existence of the prize to obtain private financing from a private bank necessary to fund his voyage. The prize issuer did have to issue the loan, the simply had to be an impartial arbiter, and it allowed dozens of people to find dozens of private offerings independently without any centralized decision making on part of the issuer of the prize.\n\nMore recently, Moon Express is a private venture competing to win the Lunar X Prize, which was able to raise more private investment and capital in greater quantities than the nominal value of the prize. The cash prize incentives and increases the likelihood of private capitalists to invest, without the prize issuer having to make centralized decisions concerning who is likely to win and should be issued a loan.\n\nCash prizes will incentivize private capital to increase access without requiring central planning and for the government to directly make investment decisions which are better left to the capitalists.\n\n> so your argument can only boil down to "people are making choices I think are sub-optimal; they should stop"\n\nI am not judging that these people choices as sub-optimal. Students are self-reporting that there choices were sub-optimal and complaining about outcomes. What I am doing is promoting a free-market solution to improve outcomes that results in less nationalization and regulation of the economy than is presently occurring. If we do not advocate for free market solutions to improve outcomes, we will end up with more socialism and nationalization of the economy.\n\n> which I really don't think is appropriate for this subreddit.\n\nI don't think that it's appropriate for people on this subreddit to advocate for the central government to engage in profit-seeking behavior which could be better handled by non-government institutions in a more competitive and free market manner.
We are very aware of it.\n\nThere's racists in America, but the brand of racism is very non-specific. It's moving out of neighborhoods with blacks in it. It's telling your kids they can't marry someone else. It's voting for someone who will ban, but not harm, the people you don't like.\n\n\nIt's a very strange, lukewarm, milquetoast racism. I don't think people understand how weak the racism is in the US compared to our classism.\n\n\nThere's other nations that I've seen that are *more* classist than the US, but if you have money in the US and dress well and speak well, you will be hardpressed to find aggressive, hateful racism in all but the most remote pockets in the south.\n\n\nThat isn't to say we don't have racism, but I've seen folks in the US stand up for people being mocked or berated in front of my eyes. White or black standing up for a guy in a turban - this isn't something I see in other nations. And I don't mean just saying 'hey knock it off', I mean physically getting up and putting themselves between.\n\nAnd I believe, without doubt in my mind, the non-racists in this nation are ten times more brave than the racists and as long as that holds true, we're on the right path. 
Anyone who makes at the 50% mark or above enjoys this - that's what people miss.\n\nThe only folks crying about the American system are the folks in the 25-40% range. Those under 25% get our welfare system and charity (which is damn good, serious - medicaid and SNAP and HUD are basic income - and they get choice, no gov assigned doctors or food plans) and those 50% and over get more out of life than anywhere else. You may have to work a bit harder for it, but honestly when Europeaners or Canadians talk about their employers - it's like the company doesn't give two shits about them. Here in the US, my employers have always gone out of their way to maximize worker benefits and happiness, we're their way to make money, so they treat us like golden cows. Sure, we still get milked, but we get a brush to make us happy so we give more milk. With how my UK counter-parts in the same company talk - it's like a company is some miserable place that cuts you checks for enslaving you and since they have NHS and shit, there's no differentiator other than pay and location. It's crazy.\n\n\nI pay $37 a month for my insurance, and my company covers 1/2 my deductible ($1500, they give $750 to my HSA). They don't have to do this, but they think the rise in Obamacare costs is unfair to pass to the workers, so they are staggering raising the price of our product while they eat some bottom line for a few years to ensure we aren't screwed.\n
I'm glad you protested Obama's 2015 6 months ban from 8 states (of the 9 on the last that Trump picked 7 from) which included visas and H1 visas.\n\n\nO...wait, you didn't.\n\n\nAs a millennial, I wish you'd all shut the fuck up and do your job, because hearing your inane bullshit day to day as a libertarian makes me with you all could go drown in an ocean.\n\n\nYou're only bitching because your dude isn't the one in power. You stand for nothing and you'll back down the second a person with a D is in front of their name to push your own flavor of nationalist agenda. You were on your feet, standing, cheering when Obama wanted to put people on the no-fly list to violate their 2nd amendment. You don't stand for my freedom, nor any other immigrant's freedom. \n\n\nSincerely,\n-1st generation American who finds it amazing how hypocritical you are all.\n\n\nedit: oh look, the reason Trump won, illustrated fully on the downvotes and comments. Not a big shocker.
Welcome to the rest of the world. \n\n\nAmerica is one of the least racist places I've seen in general (minus particular pockets and don't put Canada on this list...because Canada is like 'Gentle America' in every respect). Europe has intense pockets of racism EVERYWHERE. Especially if you include 'implicit bias' racism. 
What? I get 'unlimited' vacation. I take about 5 weeks a year, and get 2 additional 'sick weeks' and 6 weeks of paternal leave (a woman gets 12 weeks maternal because, well, obvious).\n\n\nYou might referring to minimum wage or part-time employees that don't do work that would be considered 'earning a living'. \n\n\n\nSometimes I think reddit's abundance of Americans in the lower class/are kids has seriously tainted the worldview of America. If you worked for an American company doing your same job, you'd simply not return back to the Czech Republic.\n\nYou'd roll in your cash, love your big house with a huge yard, and start complaining when it 'took you 2 days to see a doctor!!! OUTRAGEOUS!"\n\n\nThe poor in the US, by the by, don't suffer. They don't have great lives, but they get a lot for what little they contribute. It's the lower-middle class (the folks doing dead-end jobs) that really take the brunt of it. They work a lot, but since their jobs aren't that productive, they don't get paid much. So a lotta effort for no rewards, no/limited assistance.
Have you had it in pig lard?\n\nFries in pig lard, with carnitas also done in lard, in a torta sandwich, with avacado.\n\n\nIt's like poutine, but finding a way to cook the animal in its own fat with its own sides. Delicious.
Yep. He's fellated entirely while Friedman is demonized.\n\nIt's why progressives are losing the war. They've lied so much to the younger generations, now as they grow older, they begin to see it was all bullshit and shift back towards the center.
Because they want control. They feel if 'their guys' are in control, things will look better and be 'more fair' to them.\n\n\nPutting a total blanket generalization on the board that means nothing and is based solely off personal experience: I find liberals to be insanely greedy and completely have zero respect for someone else's work or property.\n\nI could false equivalence this by stating conservatives and something about personal choices to sell this, but really, I have noticed that greed and absolute power to government follows hand in hand.\n\nDoesn't mean someone else can't be destructive in other ways, too, but just noticing the trend is pretty regular: I want what you have, therefore I empower the government, in anyway, including to kill others, to take it from you.
Corporations do not pay taxes. They pass on cost.\n\nThis is literally a way to avoid paying any taxes whatsoever (since machines don't need income but you, the consumer, does) and take capital investment deductions at the same time.
Look up Hauser's law and the total receipts of IRS since 1964.\n\nCut corporate taxes? Suddenly the rich pay more income tax.\n\nCorporate tax = a tax levied on on products, like a sales tax.\n\n\nThe more you reduce corporate taxes, the more rich income taxes make up the difference and vice versa. The IRS always gets their share, if you get my drift.
> Income hasn't held steady against inflation since the 80s\n\nIt has, but for jobs that are worth their weight. Doing a job that was 'high skill' in 1950 isn't the same as doing a job that is 'high skill' in 2017.\n\n\nSo software developers make much more than mechanics, despite them being the mechanics of today. Most folks who refused to enter the workforce with a more difficult job, saw themselves regulated to service industry jobs.\n\n\nMaster mechanics still bank 100k, so they weathered it okay, but that's experience bolstering the sagging demand for their wage and labor. Now you have to be a very specialized mechanic and maybe even a robotics technician to make the same wage as an entry level mechanic used to make in 1950.\n\n\nI'm just pointing out that the average wages for Americans (even removing the top 10% of earners) have not drastically changed, and held against PPP.\n\n\nOnly 3 'daily use' things have increased relatively in price: housing, education, healthcare. Everything else: electronics, oil, cars, food, energy, etc. has gone down relative to inflation.\n\n\nIt's a mix of high spend and welfare (in the form of negative taxes or deductions) that has allowed people not to feel the slow burn of their labor falling, until the bottom totally falls out on them.
> These people seem to think that with a radical upset of social order they will somehow end up calling the shots.\n\nMy favorite part is that they continually decry billionaires as rigging the system, stealing the money, and it's all a conspiracy upheld by them - but yet think their poor masses are somehow going to take down the thousands of super intelligent people who wisely act to keep this long-run charade going full power.\n\n\nThe amount of cognitive dissonance that goes on must be mind-melding to simultaneously blame the rich for having too much control, then think that they'll somehow lose control because you pass some socialist laws in the same system that they declare corrupt because the rich manipulate the laws in their favor.\n\n\n\nThey want a dictatorship because they know that majority of Americans do not support their worldview and they have no visible means of enforcing their will on others through a democracy - so it only benefits them to destroy the barriers to someone who will arise that they perceive is like them. It's kinda like the an-caps who always want anarchy, who are the right-wing version of the leftist anarchists - like, really guys? You want the US to turn to an an-cap society with Russia and China? They'll just invade by dividing and conquering, and you'll be left in the same or worse position to your new overlords.\n\n\nAny system that requires EVERYONE in the world to belong to it is going to lose because someone won't play along and get ahead. And once one person does that, the incentive for everyone to do it becomes too strong and bam, tragedy of the commons.\n\n\n\n>For my own anecdotal experience I find that people with more left leaning socialist tendencies tend to be extremely hateful to dissenters more often than I see it from people from the right side of spectrum.\n\nThe same here. But consider this: years were spent combating the outright racism/bigotry of the right. So the younger generation grew up with the concept of bigotry being offensive and do not indulge in it, but they have kept all the other traits. This was never done with the left. They've never been hit with the metaphorical media stick and called racist/bigots for decades on end. Had they, odds are you'd see something similar.\n\n> I'm not sure how much of that we're seeing now because of the demonization of non liberals in the media at the moment and how much of it is inherent in the philosophy.\n\nPart of it is the doing of the right, who has always taken an anti-intellectual, anti-individualist stance that seeks to supplant conformity and nationalism above ground truth. So it isn't just a bunch of lefties secretly conspiring to control the media (though there is that too), it's a mix of both, and results in what we have today: Sanders and Trump voters - they're the same, think the same, with the same methodologies - their outcomes might just be a slight bit different on the moral compass.
Sorry?\n\nI'm not sorry. American was founded on immigrant suffering and sweating for a better future. If this is my lot in life, I'll take it, way better than those who came before me. \n\n\nIf I want my place here, I'll earn it, through hardwork and cultural intermixing. This country gives me the right to defend myself and I fear no man, white or otherwise.\n\n\nMore have suffered far more for far less. 
Billionaires may have a major interest in making sure all wealth generation and taxation occurs from machines.\n\nGuess who owns the machines? It's like paying for the government directly as a waiter for what laws/loopholes/human control you'd like.
Try being a middle-eastern immigrant from Iran to the united states who has lived in Montana, Wyoming, Indiana, Arizona, Oregon, California, and DC and is a consultant to Europe.\n\n\nLet me tell you the amount of hate towards the middle east exists in Germany, the UK, and France.\n\nedit: I get that in the US, especially deep blue/liberal areas, are patronizing towards minorities and that is a form of bigotry, but that's not the type of racism I'm talking about. I'm talking about hateful bigotry.\n\nYes, I am literally stating I feel more comfortable in Wyoming, who has all of like 3 black people and 10 brown people, then in large swaths of the French countryside. I dress 'white', speak fluent English, and have no beard or anything other than being an olive skinned individual with thick black hair on my body. You should see the sneers I get, not just comments or backhanded sayings, but actual, literal sneers and dirty looks.\n\nIn the US, I've seen folks say things when they think no one is listening but I can count on 1 hand I've had someone say a racist thing to my face openly. It just doesn't happen, Americans are so individualist they only hate folks in groups. The second a *person* becomes involved, it is rendered done for most Americans. For all the talk of racism and how divided America is - I call total bs. 90% of Americans will share a beer with someone across the aisle and be cordial and accommodating with them, even if they completely disagree with them.\n\n\nThis is NOT done elsewhere. You are simply NOT welcome. No one wants to talk to you. They don't care, you're what they dislike. End of story.
Are you joking?\n\nDo you know what a Castilian is? Or why they bleach their skin?\n\n\nAs someone who has traveled from Nogales to Lima, Peru - what?
So you decide to shit on a homeless man because of his political views?\n\nEver think that maybe he's in a bad position because of lefty policies that drove him to the arms of Trump?\n\nYou guys literally attacked a homeless man who was eating mayo sandwiches and is down on his luck for listening to a man who promised to shake things up and change (which is what this person wants, he has little) things. Way to go.\n\n\nCharity means helping even those who would spit in your face - you progressives are quite disgusting. To think you went from John F. Kennedy to ....this. It's amazing how bad you have to be to have Trump considered 'slightly worse'.\n\n\nThis is why Trump won. And is going to win again in 2020 if you don't knock it off. So...knock it off.
I have.\n\nI was speaking major nations. There's tons of smaller nations that are way less than everywhere else (look at the Caribbean).
Nope. I'm good.\n\nYou all pretend to be moral, downvote and virtue signal, but watching a moron do the same thing as Obama doesn't mean Obama was any different - if anything, it was worse.\n\nBecause he (and you) knew better.\n\n\nShame on you for being silent then and twice as much shame on you for only speaking up now when its popular.
Yep, people are inherently good. 99% of people will never seek to harm another person.\n\nPeople can be lazy, selfish (not greedy - difference), envious, and ignorant - but very people are cruel, mean, or hateful.\n\n\nYou can see it in the prison stats. .5% of the population has ever been arrested for a violent crime, and less than .8% for crime against property (theft, vandalism, etc).\n\n\nBut 78% donate/volunteer to charity regularly and over 90% by the world giving index do it at least once a year, regardless of income level.\n\n\nHumans are baller, and they don't need someone to tell them or force them to be good. 
> To be blunt: the racism in the U.S. is divided along Euro heritage/ African heritage lines \n\nThis is the one point I'll concede, but I concede it on classism lines. Black is associated with thief, criminal, and poor more than just 'blacks are subhuman'.\n\nNow, they're poor *because* they were treated as subhumans and they are by FAR the worst treated today, I'll agree. But I attribute this to classism that has overtaken race as the primary motivator. But it's still institutionalized prejudice, yes 100%.\n\n\n...and natives, man, that's a sad tale. No one in the US is directly hateful of natives (for the most part) but every single policy of the government.....it's like they're the favorite whipping boy that no one will stand up for. They get the shittiest shit deal. Mexico, Canada, US...all the same, too.\n\n> hell, I'd bet that most of the people you met had no clue what continent you were from, much less country.\n\nYou'd be shocked. Sometimes I'm called italian or greek, but literally everyone asks which country from the middle east.\n\n\n>I think you raise some good points, but I'd suggest that your experience would probably be different if you were a 6'4" black guy.\n\nYou're right on the money. I suspect if I was black in France, I'd have less too.\n\n\n> Edit: but overall, I'd tend to agree with your points. I'm a white guy from a rural part of a deep red state. I grew up around people who are overtly racist as long as there are only white people around, but will make exceptions for individuals of other races that they know personally. "Oh, not Johnny, he's one of the good ones." It's hypocrisy, but it speaks to the willingness of even racist Americans to get to know people of different races.\n\n\nIt's hypocrisy, but Americans put individualism over groups. Suddenly, they aren't 'black' or a 'jew', they're John or Michael, or Steve. if you have a funny name like "Abdullah" you get the nick name of "Eric" or "Dully". You can suggest it's ignorance driven, but they are literally bending over backwards mentally in cognitive dissonance as their individualism clashes with their ignorance.\n\n\nThis is why folks take people out to nowhere to beat them to death or kill them. Because if they started beating someone in a deep-red town square, they'd end up with bullet holes in them. This isn't the 1930s. Racism in the US, by in large, is against the unknown group. The second a white man works with a black man who out works him in a deep red state, they justify it by saying "see, that's why he lives here, he didn't fit in with the other blacks, he's more like us inside." Somehow, he has lost identification with that group and is now an individual.\n\n\nAnd that's why I don't fear it.
this is true, I was meaning in the same fashion as the projection of European power = US power.\n\nIf it strictly self-defense, then yes, you are right. It would just need to be dialed back a bit (maybe to US levels). 
>  you are taking the word free time out of context to fit your needs.\n\nI'm not. I'm literally stating the rich kids earn their way into life because they invest the time. \n\n\n> Parents being able to teach them financial responsibility is also education. Rich parents are able to better educate their kids on this matter.\n\nSure, just like engineer parents literally breed more curious kids (seriously!) because they instill 'how does it work' into children due to their own behavior. Whereas children of artists or creative types typically have kids who are more 'how does it make you feel'. Which, while a valid and needed expression of humanity, is not what earns the big bucks, so to speak.\n\n\n>Is it really "indoctrination" if it helps them to have successful life? \n\nYes, they don't have a choice. That's the notion of indoctrination. It's like patriotism in the US - you're indoctrinated here. Go watch anyone (myself included) at a memorial for medal of honor recipients. Play some 9/11 footage to Americans. The raw emotion you see, even among some of the most pinko liberal intellectuals, is a product of generations of indoctrination from youth.\n\nIt vastly helps the US project power and come together into a scarily united force doing times of crisis, which is not debatable in helping the success of the US - but it's still indoctrination.\n\n> You seem to have very negative attitude toward private education in the first place.\n\nNot at all. I went to terrible public schools. Most of my education came from my parents, whose families were upper middle class before they had to flee with nothing due to persecution. So I grew up dirt poor, but I was put in tons of extra-curricular programs, after school programs, my parents read to me every night and bought tons of science/engineering based toys/kits as a child and pumped me full of knowledge 24/7.\n\nFor example: I had a full encyclopedia set when I was a child (this was way before encarta 95, so let me date myself) and gave me an old Texas Instruments computer that you had to program to use when I was 4. \n\nI was told day in and day out I had to want it, that suffering was good, and study, study, study work work work. To work harder than everyone else around you, because that's success, not just simply being 'better than average'.\n\n> Literally types of University you attend is different based on family income level. are you going to argue against this?\n\n\nI'm not at all. It's like Germany or any European nation that has free public schools - who do you think is in these schools? Poor kids? It's mostly rich kids who score high on the exams.\n\n\n\nI lived in a car when I was three, but I went to a university that ranked top 15 in my field. It's not the money though, it's the parenting and values the parents hold that they indoctrinate their children with. My parents had money, lost it all, but were able to rebuild some of it due to their upbringing.\n\n\nCould I have been more successful with more money? Sure, but it's not the money, it's the parenting. They're correlated tightly, but dollars are not the casual link. That's what I'm trying to state. Money is a symptom or result of actions, not the impetus for them.
Individualist anarchists agree with libertarians that a person's body is the exclusive private property of themselves, and that final goods are private property as well. The dispute between left libertarians and right libertarians is largely over the degree of legitimacy of two specific categories of private property claims: land and capital.
> Money buys you higher quality education and lets you work on academics more freely\n\nThis is actually a myth. Rich parents simply spend more time with their kids, despite working more hours on average.\n\n\nYou realize that folks are rich usually because they are bred/taught to make great choices and invest, right? They are trained to risk/reward evaluate everything in their lives and so they devote energy to where it has the most impact. They've grown up with something to lose, so they protect that and nurture it.\n\n\nIt isn't the money - we give money to poor people all the time and they rarely excel. It has nothing to do with cash or what it 'buys' them. \n\n\nThere's a reason why rich folks go bankrupt and lose everything, then end up stinking rich again. It has significantly more to do with upbringing and values then it does with 'who they can buy'. That's a seriously bitter worldview if you think rich folks just get a silver spoon life and lie around in abject luxury.\n\n\nI've met enough self-made millionaire execs in the tech industry to know how they think/operate, and let me tell you: they don't even play video games or watch TV shows on any regular basis, because it's not building towards their future.\n\n\nThey wouldn't even post here on reddit unless it was for a specific point to benefit their position somehow.
It's not 2-4% though. They would have to collectively replace the US' presence, and the us spends 16.5% of European GDP on defense.\n\n\nSo you're looking at a 14% increase by most states, some states as much as 16%. But you are correct, welfare is the largest expense of any state, including the US (67.5% of all taxes go to welfare in the US).
Humans need not apply is the most ignorant form of drivel trash I've ever seen. And any economist who has an actual pedigree in economics will tell you the same.\n\n\nHumans need not apply assumes a socialist society with top down control (like the author's worldview) that can't grow or adapt to the rate of technology.\n\n\nBut...we live in a regulated capitalist society where humans place value on things through a series of mesh-net individual actions that aggregate up. So there will never, EVER be 'less' work as long as people want to live the same standard of life or better.\n\nA human will always have a place until humans and machines merge, and there's no preference for biological functions (companionship, craftsmanship, art, food, and sex). We're hundreds of years away from that.\n\n\nRight now the best thing we can do is simply cut corporate welfare/assistance so people feel the pain of low-skill and start training themselves to do more difficult jobs that are needed to keep up with the growing demand of high skill labor.\n\n\nHell, there's more software jobs that go unfilled or are h1 visa filled each year than unemployment. That's not counting nurses, doctors, or anything else.\n\n\nFor me, FI is about escaping the US when it collapses into a socialist hegemony and poverty sweeps the nation as China or other nations reap the benefit (similar to how the US in the 1950s-80s). If you think you need FI to avoid being impoverished....\n\nPerhaps you want to say "I need to be FI to avoid the serfdom of basic income when it arrives". But seeing as living without working is 100% unsustainable due to the increased costs of living year to year - this is a short term worry that can be absolved by just leaving the nation with having resources to do so.
Wow. A lot of 'I'm a victim' bs here.\n\nLet's dissect this:\n\n> My biological father\n\nYou may as well say "What I'm about to say has no relevance." He's not your parent. End of story. So he may make good money, but he's not your parent.\n\nFurthermore, divorce - this totally throws things in a new ballpark. A stable household is the first and most impacting thing a child can have. If your parents don't divorce - you're basically given a lottery ticket in life. Rich, poor, whatever, you're leagues ahead of anyone else in the same socio-economic status who is the product of a broken family. \n\n\nNow, it's true, sometimes divorces are super amicable and the child grows up in two loving households, so that really doesn't matter - but this is not the norm.\n\n\n>  Doesn't make you a millionaire, but at least you can die human.\n\nThe notion that being rich somehow involves you becoming a demonic workslave is a myth. Yes, you generally have to work harder, but it's well known that people who accumulate wealth 'work hard, play hard' and are very involved in their child's life, despite what made-for-tv movies tell us about the neglectful hardworking dad trope.\n\n\nIf that was the case, why the heck is anyone complaining about money advantage in schools and poor vs. rich opportunities? Folks do not like to hear it, but the rich are rich not due to luck (though some super rich can be due to luck + hardwork) but because they're bred to be superior. \n\nIt's why rich and good looking go hand in hand, too. Life isn't fair.\n\n\n> How then do explain the stunning success of the Red Cross or the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation?\n\nThey aren't cutting welfare checks for folks to spend on coca-cola, the deli counter at the grocery store, and sweet rims for their ride.\n\nDo you get what they're spending the money on? Or are you just a product of bad education to denote spending money on civic projects to remove barriers to success (such as clean water, malaria, schools) vs. welfare?\n\n\n> The latter being some of the richest Americans giving to the poorer people in the world aid and they have had such stunning success it's almost unbelievable. \n\nYes, and they're more successful than any government program. But they're able to pick and choose whom and what, whereas the government can't discriminate. So that has to be taken into account.\n\n> How then, can you make such a claim like that with evidence sitting in front of you to the contrary?\n\nBecause I'm not here with an emotional ax to grind and proceed to bleeding heart everywhere while virtue signaling about the benefits espoused by being a humble working class person.\n\n\nI'm simply telling you the way it is. If you don't like it, cool, but don't launch into ranting sob stories and expect me (or anyone else) to care. This is how it is, this is how it's always been, it isn't changing, and we're lucky rich folks are so generous that they dump their wealth into tons of projects to enrich their communities (and not just the bill gates types, but even the local millionaires). But I'm going to suggest we aren't lucky - being a millionaire means you're very aware of the impact you have and what legacy you'll leave, so I think it's inbred within most people who earn their money through hardwork/legit means (not exploiting loopholes or scams or squandering inheritance)  to return a large portion of it to the community that helped them build it.
When you need heart surgery to safe your child's life, feel free to ask the doctor's cook to perform it or a 1000 janitors.\n\n\nScarcity is the rule of the thumb. The doctor can just eat prepacked meal in the microwave and still perform a heart surgery that a robot made.\n\n> ethically, enjoy a greater share of that wealth than the guy who cooked his food while he was inventing it.\n\nAnd who gets to decide that? If the market does, that's everyone. If it's the government, that's a portion of everyone.\n\n\nThe cook got his, it's called his pay. The inventor didn't get his meal for free. If the inventor invents nothing and goes broke, should the cook also lose his job? After all, maybe if he cooked better food, the inventor wouldn't have failed?\n\n\nThis is what I don't get. It only works when you want to leech people along, but never when you want people to pay for the burden of failure in society.\n\n> by saying these record-breaking compensation packages are for record-breaking work, \n\nI'm saying 90% of the population couldn't do my job. Yet 90% of the population absolutely relies on my job. Yet I only make a few times what these people (whom, without people like me, would go without) make and I pay for their ability to live.\n\n\nRevolution is not waged by the poor. It is not waged by the dumb. It is not waged by the starving or the weak. It is waged by the powerful fighting the slightly more powerful. Name a single revolution where the common man lead it, then put themselves in positions of power, without a single rich backer.\n\n\nWe're coming to an age where automation will remove the need for 'brainless' labor and the welfare state will crumble as the elite start leaving and the general population can't take care of themselves, causing a downward spiral. Google execs are already planning on off-shoring all of google by 2030, onto floating barges in the ocean.\n\n\nA doctor spends 8 years of their life taking the hardest classes, then doing the hardest work with the most responsibility a human has directly with another human, and they barely get anything for it compared to your standard retail manager who could fuck up day in and day out and still make $55k. Yeah, that's real fair. A doctor can lose his career and be prosecuted for being tired one day, and he makes only x4, despite putting in 8 years more, fronting hundreds of thousands of dollars, and paying fifteen times the taxes.\n\n\nAnd you wonder why the divide is happening? Simply put, fewer people find it 'worth it' to do the hard jobs OR the progressive taxes and this 'overpay the people even more who get paid a fair wage for their labor already and contribute jack shit back' cause them to spike their wages up to levels that burden the system and make it impossible for anyone but the government to pay.\n\n\nEver wonder why stuff is so stupid expensive or gov provided with very little middle ground in the UK? This is why and  it's happening here. The sign of an entitled, corrupt, fading economy.
You're what we call a 'kill joy'.
You realize all of civilization has been an exploitation and culling of the weak to forge the race into a smarter, stronger, and more resilient species, yes?\n\nWar has given us the greatest leaps in humanity, despite the fact it exposes the worst in it. When you vastly depopulate an area of weak, the strong thrive. \n\n\n\nSame when you use anti-bacterial soap - you're breeding super bugs. Same here. Evolution doesn't care, you do because you're human and attach personified values, but evolution *will* be served. Universal basic income is essential a way to 'kill off' competition.\n\nWe just don't do it with spears now, we do it by enslaving portions of the race to be denied the bounty of luxury because the common needs (food, shelter, water, etc) are in such plethora the elites don't care anymore. It's literally more costly to murder or enslave physically, so they do it economically.\n\n\nI find it ironic the folks who consider themselves the most noble and socialist here are literally talking about condemning humans to a purist 'have, have-not' animal farm scenario.\n\n\n...but that's the point of capitalism. To convince the weak their place on the bottom of the ladder is acceptable. Evolution, whether violent or economic (a system of resource management that precludes physical violence) operates under the natural laws that capitalism trends towards. The strong eat the weak, and even when the most egalitarian attempt to frame things in a Star Trek way - the world has always been, and is always becoming more 'EVE Online' everyday.\n\n\nThere's more equality in Roman times than today. Think about it.
> .30-06\n\nMy phone autocorrected me with the dash for some reason. And, the .223/4 is the most commonly purchased AR-15 for competitive shoot, that's what most people talk about.\n\nMost do not chamber it with a 5.56mm or a 7.62x51, and even fewer with anything else. \n\n\nI know you *can* use the platform, but over a more traditional hunting platform? I see it as a good choice for defense, even against things bobcats/coyotes/etc.
He's said repeatedly its worse than its ever been since the 60s for American families.\n\n\nInequality is a sign of a strong economy as long as the bottom is not falling out - which it hasn't been. 
21% of all your posts reference republicans, the donald, or American foreign involvement.\n\n\n.....right. You call him a terrible person literally because you oppose his views, then turn around pretend like you don't. Gotcha.
Same.\n\nThough I don't know if I consider it a waste when I consider how happy with my life I am. Makes me spend time outside of work on things for work, which in turn lead to promotions and raises.\n\nNot sure if I'd be willing to do it if I didn't have a constant release valve. Not saying it 'pays for itself'....but I'm sure it helps offset the cost.
ctrl f "unsub" found it.
damn it rick, stop getting boners on set!
>  It also shoots flatter and retains its energy better due to a much better ballistic coefficient.\n\nBut does the bullet have enough kinetic energy over 200 yards to fell a deer in one shot?\n\nOr penetrate the skull of a javelina at 150 yards?\n\n\nI get that it has a lot of muzzle energy on the discharge, but having fired both a high pressure powder with a conical bullet at a charging javelina vs. an AR-15 (albeit mostly experience with .223 sport/competition) - I'd not really want to take it hunting.\n\nUnless it was for like coyotes/bobcat/smaller predator game that moves fast. That I understand.
user /u/raiyaz explains how a computer with narrow AI would vastly explode out the production, customization, and personalization of receivership of every medium of art.\n\nAll based on the artist's or writer's concepts or seeding of ideas. The same way we use a computer to convey information now (typing and posting via https and a keyboard) over writing letters to hand deliver to each other by pony express.\n\nA lot of folks (like CGP Grey) confuse general AI vs. narrow AI and are out to lunch on how economics (especially free market capitalism) work - they want an answer and to see the plan ...but there is no plan. The plan is created by the action of 7 billion individuals billions of times a day.\n\nIt's upsetting to authoritarian-types who need top-down and believe there should never-not be a law for something. But that's how the world actually works.\n\n\nIt's just like having a burger making machine make burgers - now the 'cook' becomes a repair tech for the machine, but you still need assembly lines and programmers and engineers to design the machine - all to replace 1 human.\n\nTechnology has yet to create fewer jobs. We have fewer people unemployed average and for more median wages than ever before in human history. All due to automation and machines.
I should prefix that with 'against all non-natives'.\n\nLiterally Canada, Mexico, and the US could be poster-children for 'oh, you think colonization was bad? We can do worse!'\n\n\nI wasn't addressing the continued systematic prejudice directed towards indigenous peoples. Because if ANYONE has a claim to racism - wow.
and yet I'm betting every major news outlet will report how 'Bernie DECIMATED Cruz' and twitter will be saturated with it.\n\n\nImportant to note: Twitter and Facebook both censor/hide/delay opposing political posts that start to go viral when they get reviewed manually (both companies have people staffed that get automatically alerted when things trend regionally).
Ding.\n\nThey thrive on competition and success, and enjoy the rollercoaster of high risk. Be glad for capitalism, because in the old days these folks were called Caesar.\n\n\nSpear through the chest/enslavement or trade legislation/licensing/patents?\n\n\nI'll take the latter, thanks!
When you get everyone from everyone in a tight proximity together, everyone becomes tolerant due to just having to deal with everyone being different all the time.\n\n\nSimply put, it's 'everything in the cosmos' in one city (politian).
I get using it as a varmint rifle, 50gr .223 rounds with a high muzzle velocity will get a good foot of penetration even at 200 yards on flesh.\n\n\nBut I just don't see it as a practical rifle for game like bucks or even large boars, honestly, even if you rechamber.  \n\n\nAs a self defense or competition shooting weapon, the AR-15 is a wonderful platform. I'm sure an expert marksman can use the AR-15 to fell bucks with high wind at 300 yards with one shot - but I wouldn't feel confident doing it.
> it has gotten worse for "American families," on average,\n\nIncome has held steady against PPP/inflation. Which means no American family (NONE, as in not even the poor or working class) has lower wages.\n\n\nBut the average family saves 18 times less than they did in 1965.\n\n\nI wonder what the reason might be - hrm. Today's average family has: cable subscription, two cars, smartphones, 1.7 fridges per family, etc. etc.\n\nIn 1960 the average family had: 1 car, 1 tv, 1 telephone, 1 fridge.\n\n\nI wonder why more and more folks are living paycheck to paycheck. Anyone wanna do a 1965 credit card debt vs 2017?\n\n\n\nI'm going to suggest this: the rich are on track making more. Nothing is wrong with them. Everything is wrong with the middle class not gaining. They're spending more but making the same, leaving them extra vulnerable.\n\n\nAside from the spending, it's obvious where all the middle class wealth has gone: to the rich via welfare to the poor. You can 1 for 1 chart it with welfare spending.
It could also be that the cost of packaging them up could mean you don't get that 1.5% raise next year due to the extra hours on the clock and waste from bags/labels.\n\nYou also have to consider that homeless in some areas are more crazy/dangerous than in others (such as in affluent areas, where help is more easily found, so many who are homeless are mentally ill) and bringing these folks around risks lawsuits and drives away business.\n\n\nIt's not just due to greed. Corporations are not any more or less evil than the average person. In fact, on average, corporations donate more as a percentage of their earnings to charity than the average person - but you don't hear on national news when some dude steals $500 from a friend, you hear about it though about corporations, even if the aggregate amount of bad actions of individuals vastly outweighs the corrupt greed of a few megacorporations.\n\n\nIt's a lot of thankless responsibility to keep a company running and profitable. You provide a valuable service, employ people, and for it you should gain wealth - but the second you do, unlike a worker, you are criticized for EVERYTHING. No one comes to your house and screams at you for wasting wood - and American consumers throw out more food than super markets.\n\n\nBut, in the era of virtue signaling and blaming everyone else without any context to make one's self feel better - it's easier to do that then actually evaluate your own life and make changes locally that benefit everyone globally.
Your finger is sore because you jammed it in a door.\n\n\nYou are bleeding from your neck.\n\n\nYou need medical assistance. Which do you treat first? \n\n\n\nIt definitely has context and it strikes directly against the narrative people are wanting to drive. You can objectively evaluate racism within a ballpark. Just like you can objectively evaluate classism.\n\n\nAmerica suffers from classism far more than racism, in fact, our racism is tied directly to classism for the most part. When you're addressing wounds, you might want to actually categorize what kind of wound and how severe it is.
Scared doggo does a heckin creep
> I was talking more about how kids have more free time and supportive parents\n\nRich kids do not have free time. This is again a myth. Rich parents put rich kids in programs that indoctrinate and en-culture them to a life of success.\n\n\nWhat you want to say is: making money teaches you to cultivate opportunities for the best chance at stellar education.\n\n\nAnd it's not semantics. It's behavioral indoctrination that even most middle/middle-upper class kids go through. That's why you are more likely to see the children of parents who ascended a quintile, also ascend a quintile in their life.
Strangely enough I don't consider the UK part of Europe (haha on brexit, but culturally I mean).\n\n\nBut yeah, I guess that's the good ol' British influence on the US culture. Classism is the bigotry of choice it seems among the British children.

Success/failure is less regulated in the US.

This. Government can be funded entirely by county-level taxes on the unimproved value of land enclosed by local landholders. Your county should then be responsible for paying all state taxes on your behalf, by paying the membership fee which the state legislature assessed and levied upon the county. Your state should then be responsible for paying all national taxes on your behalf, by paying the membership fees which congress assessed and levied upon the state. It's unnecessary to allow state governments and national governments to directly tax individuals.
I think all of them make sense literally. When you rescue a business from bankruptcy, you are intervening to ensure that it still produces value. If it collapses, then its potential to produce value is completely lost and cannot be recovered as the business no longer exists. The same goes for data which is on the verge of being lost due to mechanical failure and would be unrecoverable without intervention.\n\n> increased its marketshare 3% back to the historical norm?\n\nNo, it would have to be a situation where failure to intervene implies whatever is producing value could no longer be recovered. In the case of brand, it would be the point at which the business would have to completely abandon it and use something else.

> You can't indiscriminately allow counties to secede from states\n\nIt would not be indiscriminate. It would be through a process of democratic referendum to ensure that the residents of these counties were able to to exercise self-determination to choose whether they wished to remain in the state.\n\n>  cities to secede from counties\n\nMost states already allow for this.\n\n> apartment buildings to secede from cities.\n\nCounty governments regularly facilitate the renegotiation of boundaries between municipalities.\n\n> It's conceivable that an up or down vote with a 50% threshold\n\nWouldn't this violate the right of self-determination of residents of the eastern and northern counties?\n\n> a state of Jefferson as a future possibility\n\nWould you support allowing the formation of a state of Jefferson as part of a CalExit referendum process, or would the counties have to try and secede from California at a later date?\n\n> they can move or get over it\n\nI suppose I would argue that we have a moral and ethical obligation to minimize the amount of upheaval and reduce the number of people displaced from their land. Historically, large scale border partitions have been associated with genocide such as the 1947 partition of India which lead to the independence of Pakistan.\n
I think the potential problem of landlocked regions can be solved by using a recursive adjacency rule.\n\nA county can secede from a state if secession passes a majority vote by voters and is either adjacent to the edge of a state or adjacent to another county for which this statement is true.\n\nWhen counties secede from states, I would propose that they resort to unincorporated territories still part of the United States that would be given the option to join an adjacent state or form a new state which receives new representation in the Senate, House of Representatives, and electoral college. I would support a constitutional amendment guaranteeing this and think it would make it easier for states to secede from the union and become new sovereign nation states if there was a process for changing borders ahead of time while remaining in the union.
It's possible to acquire sufficient revenues to maintain public order without taxes on income or consumption, by only taxing criminals who violate property rights, businesses who pollute the environment, and landowners who enclose scarce natural resources to prevent others from accessing them.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geolibertarianism\n\nIt's also possible to decentralize the collection of land value taxes on the enclosure of natural resources by replacing federal taxes with membership fees levied upon the states and state taxes with membership fees levied upon their counties. The federal and state governments do not need to directly tax individuals and businesses in good standing.
grew up in gary. this is true.
Not all taxation is theft, only aggressive taxation is theft.\n\nFines and fees levied against criminals for violation of property rights are not theft.\n\nHowever, fines and fees are certainly examples of taxes if any portion of the revenues acquired goes to pay for the cost of the courts and government which provides the courts.\n\nFines and fees against criminals are also coercive if they force criminals to surrender the gains they have made against their will. It is in the self-interest of criminals to keep the property they have stolen from others and not to surrender stolen goods voluntarily.\n\nCertain types of taxes which disincentivize the private violation of property rights are a legitimate and moral function of government because they are a defensive use of force and coercion rather than an offensive or aggressive use of force and coercion.
Ethics are powerless to constrain those without them until they are enforced by those who hold them. When ethics are enforced in a decentralized and distributed manner in which no one is immune from prosecution, the result is democracy.
I don't think such a thought experiment is a useful example as it assumes a false dilemma where everyone has perfect knowledge of outcomes. If everyone derives minimum utility from being killed and maximum utility from living, then the net utility for both decisions would still be very close to zero.\n\n If anyone is able to propose a different mutually exclusive course of action that does not involve the guaranteed death of approximately half the population,  then that option will most likely provide the most members of the group with the most utility and have a much higher score than either the 49 or 51 death option. Even if there is predestination and the omnipotent entity knows there is no way to cheat death and that attempting to do so will result in one of the other two outcomes, the people making the decision do not.
Thanks for answering, my inquiry was simply to survey your views and see whether you were advocating for purely discretionary or for a rules based monetary policy.
Instead of making fun of indebted students, it might be better to actually discuss policy solutions to the student loan problem that a majority of people might actually agree with us on. There are more and more people recognizing that subsidized loan programs are bad policy and result in pass through effects on the cost of tuition.
If we will still have a union for freedom of movement, travel, and collective defense, perhaps it might be best to describe what such an arrangement would like before a breakup. It may be productive to describe how such a new arrangement would work simply so we can assure that it would not immediately convert back into our current system. If it will readily change back into what we have now there is the risk that we will have wasted our time focusing our efforts on such a major change.
Fees and fines are also taxes. Fines which coercively seize gains from criminals who have committed property rights violations are not theft. They are restitution or punishment. Taxes are only analogous to theft if they are both coercive and aggressive, which not all taxes are. Taxes are also different than theft in a descriptive, historical, and legal sense.
Not all taxes are theft, only some taxes are theft.\n\nFees and fines are a tax if any portion of them goes towards funding operations of government services such as courts, however they are are considered punishment or restitution if they are levied in response to property rights violations.\n\nIf a government coercively forces a criminal to surrender gains made from private theft, this is not theft of theft. If a government fines a business for polluting the environment and preventing people from accessing clean air and water, this is not theft either, even it is against the will of the company to pay. This is because the force applied in the above instances by government is defensive and corrective rather aggressive, as the initial aggression was performed by private actors. Theft implies aggression and not all possible taxes are aggressive.
> Taking money or goods from convicted criminals after the court case is also not a tax, it's a punishment. \n\nIf a portion of the goods are used to compensate the cost of court administration, it is both a punishment and a tax. Fees and fines against property rights violations are examples of taxes if any portion of the revenues gained are used to fund government.
> "I'll lend you $50k, but I'll "pay" your interest on the loan while you're in school" does not make it a subsidy, it is a bookkeeping term.\n\nIt's not a subsidy to the student. It's a subsidy to the bank issuing the loan. It provides the bank with additional money to issue credit for questionable ventures it would otherwise be unlikely to secure a return from, such as funding people with poor long term planning to go into massive debt for a gender studies degree. Making it more attractive for students to do so through subsidized credit alters there willingness to do so via induced demand. Subsidizing banks to engage in financing ventures which would otherwise be unlikely to generate revenue is a misallocation of resources which makes society poorer.\n\nIf the ability of the state to acquire large concentrations capital necessary for a specific social venture is dependent upon its status as a central monopoly, then the wisdom of its investments should be examined by comparing them to what voluntary transactions are occurring in the free market. The free market approach to improving accessing to education provided by non-government non-profits is grants, not subsidizing third party loans. This indicates that grants might be a better social arrangement that better maximizes the self-interest of the involved parties than subsidies for third party loans, which may not maximize the self-interest of all involved parties.\n\n>  Contracts are coercive now?\n\nAccording to Hayek, laws should be (1) general and abstract, (2) known and certain, and (3) equally applicable to all people. Treating lenders who provide school loans differently than lenders who do not provide school loans violates these principles. There is no reason to make school loans a special case of debt which is non dischargable when other forms of debt are dischargable. Whatever the law is on matters of dischargability, it should be applied equally regardless of the industry.\n\n> Doesn't that give you some indication that maybe you need to rethink your view?\n\nIf we are discussing general views on education, I would describe myself as a minarchist oppossed to most government education spending entirely. What I advocate for in order to provide a public incentive for people to become educated is one-time cash prizes per-pupil per-subject, which pay out the same to anyone who can pass a test even if they were home-schooled or self-taught. I believe this would provide the most positive and direct incentive with the least quantity of perverse incentives.\n

Subsidized student loans are called 'subsidized' for a reason. That reason they are called subsidized is because a subsidy exists. Subsidized student loans are a subsidy to lenders to misallocate credit into non-productive ventures which they would otherwise not rationally invest in. Coercive federal policies which prevent student debt from being dischargable in the same manner as other debt then are used to ensure that these non-productive loans still generate a return. Many of these investments would not generate a return and would be unprofitable for the loaning entity under real market conditions.
> I have no ability to consent or not consent to the taking of my money.\n\nThat does not make all taxation a form of theft. If you had previously stolen the money by violating the property rights of others, or had gained the money through externalizing costs onto other such as by polluting the environment, then if you are taxed in proportion to the gain you have acquired or fined an even more burdensome amount, this would be considered restitution or punishment and not theft.\n\nIt is a coercive seizure for government to take property from criminals against their will in order to return it to their victims or create a punitive disincentive against further property rights violations, but it is a defensive use of force rather than an aggressive use of force as the government was not the one to initiate the use of force, the criminal was.\n\nTaxes are only theft if they are aggressive and not in response to previous property rights violations by those who are being taxed.
>  1) You can try to advocate certain legislation to your cause by using the political system. 2) You can LEAVE the country.\n\nIf you live in a border community and are not allowed to take the land with you when you leave, and the state asserts that its borders and territorial claims are immutable historical constructs not dependent on the will of the people who reside within them, and there are restrictions on freedom of movement and immigration restrictions in neighboring nations you wish to emigrate to, then this is an involuntary relationship and cannot be said to be a free choice.\n\n> You see, nothing about this is involuntary though. You can go to another state (competitor) and you even have democratic power as a shareholder.\n\nThat's not the case. There is no free market for citizenship and residency between competing nation states because there are no open borders and restrictions on immigration. Additionally, the borders delimiting boundaries between sovereign states are involuntary constructs which have been created through wars rather than peacefully renegotiated.\n\nWithin the United States there is a slight amount of freedom to vote your feet and move to different states within the Union. However the borders between states are still involuntary and immutable historical artificats that are not actively revised and negotiated between citizens.\n\nIn order to improve the freedom of people to vote with their feet, we would need a federal constitutional amendment to guarantee that right of counties to secede from the 50 regional states while still remaining within the US federal system, and have the ability to incorporate as a new state with different borders and receive representation within congress and the electoral college without having to leave the union first. We would also need to abolish all direct federal taxation on individuals and businesses and only allow the federal government to raise revenues through membership fees upon the states, which the states are then allowed to implement their own tax policies in order to collect.\n\nIf there was a large federal system in which the borders of states could be voluntarily renegotiated, there was guranteed freedom of movement between the states, and the responsibility for raising all public revenues was devolved to the states, then perhaps there would be some degree of voluntariness and people could be said to 'choose' which taxes they were subjected to. However, we are far from realizing this goal, and there is certainly no free market for choosing what state to live under in the world at large.
> k-inflation rate policy \n\nDoes this refer broadly to any discretionary process which might be used to implement inflation rate targetting?\n\nIf so, are there any specific rules or constraints which you believe an optimal discretionary process should follow?
According to Hayek, laws should be (1) general and abstract, (2) known and certain, and (3) equally applicable to all people. Treating lenders who provide school loans differently than lenders who do not provide school loans violates these principles. There is no reason to make school loans a special case of debt which is non dischargable when other forms of debt are dischargable. Whatever the law is on matters of dischargability, it should be applied equally regardless of the industry.
High paying careers already have positive financial incentives attached. Students will naturally be attracted to them as long as there are not perverse incentives steering them somewhere else.\n\nI think the smallest government solution for incentivizing education would be one time cash prizes per pupil per subject for demonstrating proficiency as measured by accredited independent testing agencies. Students could complete tests as fast as they wanted and get paid the same amount even if they were self-taught or homeschooled.
With range voting you are allowed to rate all of the candidates the minimum possible score to express your displeasure and have that factored into the candidate's publicly published average approval score.\n\nYou would not be allowed to do this under 'ranked voting', as ranked voting forces you to assign a strict ordering of preferences for each candidate on the ballot.\n\nThe Republic of Venice had Range 3 voting where candidates were rated between -1, 0 or 1, and if a candidate did not have a positive score above minimum threshold, the vote would be redone. They only had 40 electors voting on their highest office which had a lifetime term however.\n\nDo-overs may be less necessary with the more frequent elections and larger pool of voters and candidates present in the United States. If a candidate did succeed in getting elected with a very low score, this would act as a strong signal for an opposition party to invest in running a candidate against them in the next election, even if there was not a do-over held right away. It would be relatively easy to add a do-over criteria and amendment once range voting is enacted however, as the problem of a candidate receiving a very low score and still being allowed to serve due to lack of competition would be extremely transparent.\n\nhttp://rangevoting.org/VenHist.html2
I believe that in the 1970s and 1980s when Thatcher and Reagan hybridized some of the classical liberalism of Hayek and Friedman with conservatism, social liberals began identifying more with socialists and progressives out of political necessity.

> "smaller government" doesn't mean anything anymore\n\nSmall government implies that the proportion of resource allocation decisions made by a central government responsible for the provision of justice services are a small proportion of the total resource allocation decisions made by all of the institutions in an economy. It implies that the central institution responsible for providing justice is specialized to only deliver the services in which it has an absolute natural advantage and that it does not engage in directly providing goods and services in unrelated areas which might lead to conflicts of interest and damage its impartiality in carrying out its core functions.
If you break up the United States into many seperate sovereign nation states you will still have statism and taxes. There will be less freedom for people to vote with their feet if these states establish non-free borders which impose separate restrictions on immigration, movement, and trade. The borders between the states are still likely be involuntary determined through violent conflict. Additionally, the smaller states will be more likely to fall under the influence of a hegemonic foreign power.\n\nThis reduces the ability of the states to self-govern and we cannot assume that the foreign hegemon influencing and intervening in state affairs will be interested in preserving and protecting liberty. They may well be incentivized to encourage the election of oppressive leaders who will impose restrictions on freedom of speech and support the repeal of constituional protections of natural rights which we currently take for granted.\n\n\nThis is not to say the secession is always a negative. It could be a positive if the seceding entity was doing so to establish a superior and more flexible constitutional framework which allowed for voluntary expansionism and the re-entry of the existing territories from which it seceded under the new terms of the superior system. However if it is simply the same-old statism on a smaller scale but more borders and more restrictions on travel I don't see much to get excited about.

> It would cost taxpayers billions\n\nWe are already spending approximately $12,000 per student per year for 8 courses for public high school students. This amount could be converted to $1500 prize per pupil for course finished in a revenue neutral manner for secondary school students. Public schools could be restructured as contractual non-government non-profits which teach students in exchange for keeping 80% of the prize pool for courses instructed.\n\nPrivate donors would also be able to contribute matching funds to public education prize pools, and donations would be tax deductible.\n\nFor advanced degrees, prize pools would be established to create incentives for members of the population to pursue strategically important skillets such as aeronautical engineering, nuclear physics, etc. that are directly justifiable for the state to use tax revenues to fund upon national defense considerations. Private companies would also be incentivized to contribute tax deductible private donations to these prize pools. It would also be in the self-interest of private businesses to voluntarily contribute in order to ensure there remains a high supply of skilled workers necessary to fuel their production, and so they do not have to internalize the cost of training workers themselves.\n\n> It doesn't solve the problem of access in any way - there are many students who would not have the capital (or credit) to achieve these goals\n\nWhen you attach a fixed price to the obtainment of an objectively specified goal, it acts as a price signal for private providers to offer a variety of services to meet, without the state making any centralized decisions about what form these services should take. Inducement prize contests are a good example:\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inducement_prize_contest\n\nThe establishment of a modest public prize for transatlantic flight allowed Charles Lindbergh to pursue private financing for his voyage in a manner that was mutually agreeable to all parties.\n\nAdditionally, Moon Express, a private venture established specifically for the purpose of wining the Lunar X-Prize, was able to raise a greater investment from private investors which exceeded the total price of the prize they were attempting to win.\n\n

Non-dischargable debt agreements would normally be very costly for private providers to enforce and collect. Because the state has a monpoly on force and existing infrastructure for the coercive extraction of revenue, it is able to use this monopoly to its unfair advantage when competing in the debt provision business. Unlike private lenders, the government does not have to obtain an independent judgment from an external and impartial arbiter in order to garner wages for its loans. The fact that it is not required to do so is a conflict of interest that interferes with its primary mandate to be a fair and impartial arbiter of disputes.\n\nWithout the government program, US enforcement of non-dischargable debt agreements would normally be limited to incidents of fraud or fines. Additionally, we have empirical evidence that government subsidized loans do increase total level of debt by increasing the total cost of tuition:\n\nhttps://www.newyorkfed.org/medialibrary/media/research/staff_reports/sr733.pdf\n\nThere are also many economic arguments that the increased student loan burden has had overall negative effects on the economy and slowed economic growth:\n\nhttp://www.businessinsider.com/3-charts-explain-the-effect-of-student-loans-on-the-economy-2015-5\n\n

> This would not be coercion, but would be the legal requirement of handling one party infringing on the property rights of other parties.\n\nIt absolutely is coercion if surrendering the goods is against the will of the criminal, and force must be employed to refute their interest. However, it is defensive coercion rather than aggressive coercion, since the criminal was the one to initiate force, not the government. Libertarianism doesn't have a problem with defensive coercion and force, only aggressive coercion and force. A society which does not use coercion and force to counter aggressors is likely to experience a net increase in total coercion because the social order would be allowing aggressors to go unchecked.\n\n>  Businesses would pay a fine equivalent to the value of their pollution related damages to the people who the pollution affected, etc.\n\nDevaluaing and destroying natural resources in a manner that will permenately prevent others from accessing them is a cause for concern, even if the land is enclosed and you are forcibly excluding people from entering the area in which they would be exposed to harmful pollutants. Unlike their body, personal property, capital, and site improvements, individuals do not possess final ownership over natural resources such as land, air, and water which have been temporarily privately enclosed from the commons.\n\n> You have a human right to your property\n\nLibertarianism is based on self-ownership. You are the final owner of yourself, your labor, and the products of your labor. You are not the final owner of land, air, and water. These are natural goods which preexisted man and were not the products of anyone's labor.\n\n> If a company wants to pollute the atmosphere with so many tons of carbon, they have to pay a fine equivalent to the estimated damage they've caused to the people\n\nThere is no incentive for the company in question to actually follow libertarian ethics and pay for damages of the people they negatively affect unless the people they affected were willing to democratically organize and force them to pay. If the party responsible for damages helps fund the operating cost of the court, then this is a source of government revenue and a tax.
Legitimate taxes should only be levied upon aggression and property rights violations. If the robots or robot owners are non-aggressive then they should not be taxed. If robots or robot owners engage in aggression to exclude others from access to natural resources or to pollute the environment then they should be taxed.\n\nIf there is a "grey goo" scenario where an extremely efficient self-reproducing robot tries to acquire all of the natural resources in society to produce things more efficiently, then it should be taxed in proportion to the level of resources which it is excluding others from access to. However if this robot is not engaging in economic activities which prevent others from access to natural resources, then it should be left alone and not taxed at all.
Whoever wins the primary.
If your dishwasher theoretically was an AI that was capable of self-reproduction and tried to seize access to all of the natural resources in society in order to wash dishes more efficiently, then it should be taxed in proportion to the natural resources it was excluding humans from using.\n\nHowever if your dishwasher was minding its own business and not actively excluding humans from access to natural resources then no it should not be taxed.
> What difference does it make if we say that air is communal or private?\n\nIt would be much easier to justify a standing tax on industrial air pollution by businesses if it is treated as a communal good, as enclosing the property to destroy or devalue it before returning it to the commons in a manner that provides less access to clean air to others would be an automatic property rights violation. In the case that air is treated as private property, an economic burden would be placed upon specific individuals to prove they have standing to initiate class action lawsuits against pollutors. So I would say there would be quite a large difference in consequences concerning how different perspectives on property rights for air translate get translated into policy, law, and how that affects the probability that the average person has access to clean air in their daily life.\n\n> By what process would a geolibertarian society determine the economic character of natural resources?\n\nThe general principle I have established is that natural goods are goods which have pre-existed humans.\n\n> And how would they ration goods that are determined to be economic?\n\nPigouvian taxes on pollution and land value taxes on the unimproved location value of enclosed land. Individuals still hold private property titles for the use of the land to manage site improvements in the same manner they do presently. However the title would not be a title of 'final ownership', in the sense that they may be obligated to pay a resititutive fee to the community in exchange for the preservation of the title, in proportion to the value they gain from excluding others from access or use of the enclosed area.\n\n> Are you aware of any literature on that subject?\n\n John Locke established the ethical principle in the form of the 'lockean proviso' in the second treatise on government. Turgot, Adam Smith, David Ricardo, Henry George all advocated for a land value tax on the unimproved rental value of land using economic reasoning. Henry George was responsible for the 'Georgist' movement which many economists have subscribed to including Leon Walras. Walras was one of three original formulators of the marginal theory of value and pioneer of modern macroeconomic equilibrium theory. Milton Friedman referred to the land value tax as the 'least bad tax'. It is well understood by economists that a land value tax, unlike consumption and income tax, does not create deadweight loss. Fred Folvary writes on geolibertarianism, cellular democracy, and land value tax. Nicolaus Tideman writes on what he refers to as 'geoliberalism'.\n
There is a natural monopoly on the provision of courts of last resort and laws concerning property rights. Recognizing the difference between an aggressor and a defender requires a consensus on which claims of property ownership are legitimate and which are illegitimate in order to differentiate between legitimate use of force and illegitimate use of fource. If these services are not provided by a centralized monopoly then the result is an increase in the total level of violence and a more destructive system of dispute resolution involving feuds.\n\nNow, while there is a natural advantage for courts of last resort and laws to be provided by a central monopoly, for nearly every other good or service there is no advantage, and monopolies are bad. Diseconomies of scale and inefficiencies will kick in once things become overly centralized and non-competitive. Additionally, when the central government is used to directly supply goods and services, it generates conflicts of interest that decrease its ability to write laws and resolve disputes in an impartial manner.

Right libertarians, anarcho-capitalists, classical liberals, and geolibertarians support private ownership of capital. Libertarians in the Libertarian Party  generally fall into the above groups and support capitalism.\n\nLeft libertarian socialists do not support capitalism, but take different approaches as to what they would do about it. Some may argue that while they oppose capitalism, protecting individual human rights takes higher priority than abolishing capital. I am not a socialist myself, but I think libertarian socialists should still be considered libertarians as long as they believe in self-ownership and individual rights.
Ludwig von Mises is the archetype of classical liberal. Friedrich Hayek founded the Mont Perlin society with Mises and referred to himself as a 'liberal' without qualification until at least the late 1970s.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friedrich_Hayek#United_Kingdom_politics
Fees and fines are also taxes. Fines which coercively seize gains from criminals who have committed property rights violations are not theft. They are restitution or punishment. Taxes are only analogous to theft if they are both coercive and aggressive, which not all taxes are.

I pronounce the geo in geolibertarianism as in geology or geoscience because it advocates for a property rights system with special consideration to natural resources. Additionally, while the land value tax was most strongly popularized by Henry George, the idea was also forwarded by Turgot, Smith, and Ricardo, and I think the broader ethical criteria was forwarded by John Locke: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lockean_proviso\n\nConcerning trying it on a smaller scale, converting federal and state taxes into membership fees which lower heirarchies of government can opt-in to would allow for that. State governments might exempt all individuals and businesses in a county from state taxes if the county paid for taxes in the form of a membership fee on their behalf. Congress might exempt all individuals and businesses in a state from federal taxes if the state was able to pay a membership fee for federal services on their behalf. If a state was unable to pay its membership fee or did not in to the program, the federal government could resort to direct taxation for individuals and businesses in that area.\n\nResidents could then move to the county which they felt had the best tax policy and people could vote with their feet.
A tax on aggression, pollution, or the exclusion of others from access to natural resources is not theft.\n\n>  if someone forces their way into a transaction to take a share of the property exchanged, doesn't that always qualify as theft?\n\nNot if the original exchange of property was already involuntary or a violation of property rights. In which case a defensive third party (government) could be justified in fining the aggressive party, even if it was against the will of the aggressor to pay the fine, in order to disincentivize further aggression in the future.
> you're arguing that we should not engage in mutually profitable exchanges because you think people are better off with fewer options\n\nMy general claim concerning the education market would be that students will have a much greater number of opportunities for obtaining skill and knowledge based credentials and have greater access to education if government funding of schools was eliminated, including the elimination of subsidized loans for 4 year degrees.\n\nThe alternative I advocate for to provide a public incentive for people to become educated is one-time cash prizes per-pupil per-subject. \n\nPrizes pay out the same to anyone who can pass a test even if they were home-schooled or self-taught. Government regulation would be limited to accreditation of test administration firms in order to ensure tests were administered fairly and that answers to questions were not being sold ahead of time. There would be no government oversight or regulation of schools or even the centralized assumption students must go to school to become educated. Compulsory secondary school attendance would also be eliminated, and public high schools would no longer act as customer funnels for colleges and college loan providers.\n\nThe fixed price attached to the obtainment of an objective public goal would act as a price signal that would facilitiate the creation of a private education market dedicated to improving access to education without requiring the government to make any centralized assumptions about the form these services would take.
> Are you talking about restitution to the victim? If yes, why would you consider that a tax?\n\nIf the entity performing the resitution is a government, it relies on its status as a central authority in order for the restitution to be legitimate, and it takes a cut from either the criminal or the victim's property in order to cover the cost of administration (capturing the violator, making them appear before court, holding the proceedings), then the amount the government took out as overhead was a tax.
> This is what the founders of the United States advocated for. This could be implemented in an AnCap society as well.\n\nIt works in the United States because we have a democracy with constitutional guarantees. If democracy is disbanded then constitutional and ethical restrictions on abuses of power would be meaningless. The private court providers could simply start arresting and killing all of the libertarians who insisted they had a right to keep and bear arms and there would be no public democratic courts to constrain the power of the private courts. There would also be no non-violent means to depose the authorities in charge of the private courts which appeared likely to crack down on private firearm ownership in the future if there were no  elections, and the probability of violent conflict occurring to resolve disputes would be increased.
A tax on coercion, aggression, pollution, or the forceful exclusion of others from access to natural resources is not theft.\n\nOnly the initiation of aggressive taxation upon peaceful individuals is theft.

Intuitively k-percent seems like a behavioral rule which an actor responsible for monetary policy can actually follow, as the rate at which money is printed is a variable under their direct control. Inflation targetting does not seem like such a rule, as inflation is an external property which the monetary actor observes and then must react to using a large number of unspecified possible behaviors.\n\nDifferent discretionary processes will be implemented using different behaviors and rules. Assuming a fixed inflation rate is the goal, are there any behaviors which are known to be harmful for the monetary actor to perform? Are there any behaviors which are known to beneficial? Do objective rules exist which allow us to differentiate between positive behaviors and negative behaviors before they are performed, and are these rules precise enough to be followed by a deterministic computer program?
However if the taxpayers who are paying for the program only wish for it to be spent on healthy food, the program would be less voluntary and consensual if the government administering the program allowed the funds to be spent on junk food, because in an ideal scenario where funding was voluntary those funding the program would be less willing to pay.
Fees and fines are certainly examples of taxes if any of the revenue gained from them is used to fund government services.
There have always been capitalism vs socialism debates on this subreddit. I think the amount of left wing criticism of libertarians was actually greater during the Ron Paul campaigns when /r/EnoughPaulSpam was much more active.\n\nMost of the trolling and shilling targetting libertarian subreddits lately has come from neoreactionaries and the alt-right, not leftists.\n\nConcerning left-libertarians, if they still subscribe to self-ownership and assert that preserving individual rights is more important than and takes priority over establishing a socialist economy, then I don't see the problem with them referring to themselves as libertarians. Right libertarians hold to the principle of original appropriation for resolving disputes over scarce resources and left libertarians were the first users of the libertarian label historically.
I don't think you understand my position. I am against government subsidized student loans, as are many libertarians, because they create preverse economic incentives which unnaturally steer people toward low paying jobs. It allows universities to charge high prices for less valuable degrees which there is low real market demand for and incentivizes people to invest in these degrees when they otherwise would not have due to financial considerations. This misallocation of resources created by government intervention into the economy is something of great concern to libertarians especially those associated with the Austrian school of economics.\n\nThe article I linked gives a basic economics lesson on incentives from an economics professor. It was a straightforward example about economic incentives and how government can mess them up, and something that I believe all economic schools of thought will agree with.
> One of the reasons it's hard to convince the average person that libertarian principles are worthwhile is that freedom is scary.\n\nIt's also because people regularly make logical mistakes when deductively reasoning from principles and libertarians are usually bad at giving examples of specific applied proposals which allow people to work backwards inductively to verify whether or not the principles are true.\n\n> The idea that Trump answering his detractors and flinging shit back at them somehow threatens the very foundations of the republic is laughable hyperbole.\n\nIf the people no longer have a shared concern for the truth, then public political debate will be meaningless. If people can no longer debate and discuss the issues directly, then they will be incapable of self government. If people are incapable of self-government, then they will not be capable of maintaining a free society and will be ruled by others. Trump has no regard for the truth and repeatedly lies about mundane things with no evidence (cheering on 9/11, inauguration crowd size, 5 million illegal votes, biggest electoral college victory since reagan, etc). Valuing the truth is a fundamental value which proceeds other values and principles such as liberty, because without a concern for the truth there is no incentive to check whether one's reasoning about other principles was correct.
Unskilled service sector jobs in which the graduate did not use their degree to obtain a comparative advantage over other workers and where the graduate preferred they had invested the opportunity cost of their degree in something else.
You're right grey goo usually refers to more of a doomsday nano machine scenario. I suppose I was imagining more of a hyper-efficient corporation run by an AI with robot workers. In the later scenario its growth would be constrained by its level of access to natural resources which humans also own or use, and it should not be allowed to monopolize access to natural resources without compensation.
Central planning creates induced demand:\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Induced_demand\n\nIf people are consuming non-dischargable debt agreements vs dischargable debt agreements to fund education at higher rate in a centrally planned economy which has nationalized the market for education access than they would in a free market economy, I would consider this to be a perverse outcome, and the loans offered by the government to be a perverse incentive, crowding out the other incentives which a more competitive market might naturally offer.\n\nWhen government is responsible for centrally allocating large quantities of capital for supplying a good or service, we need to consider the opportunity cost of it doing so and attempt to determine whether or not the market would look different if it had not.
For a given set of mutually exclusive alternatives for which a collective decision can be made, if we were to simply ask people to rate how much utility they expect to derive from each alternative given their current knowledge, and pick the option with the highest reported total utility via a simple arithmetic sum, would you consider this to be a utilitarian decision? Because on paper we would be maximizing total utility while relying on self-reported utility scores without any assumptions of perfect knowledge.
We are all just kids trying to figure it out as we go.
I think it is more accurate to state that libertarians advocate for competing currencies than a gold standard. While Ron Paul advocates for gold based upon its merits, the primary argument ethical argument he makes is for competing currencies. He simply hypothesizes that gold-backed currencies is the most popular solution that a free market would arrive at if free competition was allowed.\n\nConcerning the existence of an upper bound on the number of bitcoins, I don't think the existence of a cap is as important as the fact that the expansion of bitcoin is governed by an objective principle or rule.\n\n> In a free market, as demand for a country’s currency increases, so does its value. When a country prints more currency, it’s supply increases, and its value decreases.\n\nThe value of a currency is also dependent on its utility as a medium of exchange. The utility a currency provides is also dependent upon infrastructure, adoption, and network effects. A fiat currency with only one unit is worthless if only one person holds it because it cannot be used as a medium of exchange. If the currency was expanded so that two people can hold it and use it to trade then it provides more utility as a unit of account and its value and demand may increase despite the expansion.
We do actually know a fair amount about Iceland. But what we do know is that while they did not have taxes, they still had a central parliamentary body with democratic representation, and experienced problems with deforestation (negative environmental externalities), slavery, and blood feuds. Their political system also collapsed once a foreign power, the King of Norway, decided to intervene.\n\nI think ancaps like to use it as an example primarily because they think no one else will actually bother to research their claims on it.
What are the properties or constraints which you believe an optimal rule should follow?
I think addressing public concerns by discussing how libertarian principles can be applied public policy is more effective at building support for libertarianism than insulting strangers using stereotypes. Sure we can do both, but it seems less effective than only doing the first, unless there is some hidden benefit to insulting people that I am missing.
> How would they get that power? Courts don't do any restraining or arresting. They need enforcement services for that\n\nIn the proposal by David Friedman, enforcement and courts are provided by the same private entities. The private owners of the court + enforcement agency would have the power to violate rights using parallel organizations simply by virtue of possessing ownership of the private justice system and instructing it not to prosecute him.\n\n> As opposed to the "democracy with constitutional guarantees" where resistance to even bad police action is often treated as a felony and the resisters, having already been largely disarmed\n\nAmerica has not been disarmed, we still have political speech, and historical Republics such as the Roman Republic did not have a central police force at all. The police are much more oppressive in privately controlled monarchies such as Saudi Arabia, where people are executed for political speech much more frequently. The freedom situation would be even worse under monarchies if there were not hegemonic democratic nations urging them to respect human rights and the world order has collapsed back into the dark ages of competing monarchies.
> There in fact would be no court of last resort in an libertarian society.\n\nCourts of last resort are necessary for a libertarian society emerge. History indicates that without them the preferred method of resolving disputes will be feuds, which will result in a much higher prevalence of aggressive coercion due to collateral damage and collective punishment.\n\n> it's quite odd to speak of 'economies of scale' in regard to a court service\n\nA court produces judgements. It cannot produce judgements unless it can compel both parties to attend. There is no coincidence of wants between the defendent and the aggressor. Only the defendent and other members of society want justice, the aggressor does not. The value provided by a courts is proportional to its power to engage in defensive coercion against aggressors. If a court is unable to yield greater quantities of coercion than the potential aggressors in its jurisdiction then it is unable to produce judgements, because it will be unable to compel the aggressor to submit to judgement. Courts are a natural monopoly. The court with the fewest number of actors able to wield greater quantities of coercion than it is the court that delivers the best service and is able to deliver the most judgement. If an actor possesses greater potential for coercive power than the most power court, then whether or not a society will be libertarian is a matter of their subjective preferences and whether they decide to self-impose libertarian ethical restrictions.\n\n> Read Machinery of Freedom\n\nPrivate companies do not have an innate incentive to do what is best for their customers as Friedman asserts. They have an innate incentive do what is best for their owners. This only coincides with an incentive to do what is best for customers if maximizing customer value is a subjective preference of the owners or the owners are presented with a strong disincentive to engage in aggressive theft and rent extraction due to the possibility of punishment by a substantially stronger external power. If they do not intrinsically value libertarian ethics and are not subject to hegemonic control by an external power there is no reason to believe they will enforce libertarian ethics rather than simply resorting to aggression.\n\nUnder the chapter the stability problem Friedman readily sets up his idea for failure if there is a natural monopoly:\n\n>  If there are only two or three agencies in the entire area now covered by the United States, a conspiracy among them may be practical. If there are 10,000, then when any group of them start acting like a government, their customers will hire someone else to protect them against their protectors. How many agencies there are depends on what size agency does the most efficient job of protecting its clients. My own guess is that the number will be nearer 10,000 than 3. If the performance of present-day police forces is any indication, a protection agency protecting as many as one million people is far above optimum size.\n\nUsing police departments to guesstimate numbers is ridiculous. Civilian police departments are a relatively modern invention and are not the primary source of authority of the state. The Roman Republic had no public police forces at all until it became an empire. The authority of the courts is hierarchical and ultimately backed the power of the army.\n\n> That is exactly what Machinery of Freedom advocates\n\nIt does not advocate for democratically provisioned courts.
If you really derived a lot of value from that piece of litter, maybe it was a crumpled up copy of something that only you recognized which others did not, then yes I think it would be fine if you claimed you rescued it from the landfill. Different people derive different  value from different things. To claim you rescued it would imply you subjectively valued it, but I don't think it necessarily implies a moral claim.
Well I would consider a free market to be a market free from aggressive coercion where entities are restricted by libertarian ethics concerning property rights rather than a market simply free from restrictions.\n\nConcerning public services, I would lean more towards minarchism and believe the one essential thing that I think always must be publicly provided in a centralized democratic manner is courts of last resort for resolving disputes. If the government acquires excess revenue from levying fines on the violation of property rights, such as large businesses damaging natural resources and the environment, perhaps it could disburse of liquid assets in a pro-social manner. However I think the central government should try to avoid directly producing and supplying goods and services not related to the resolution of disputes where possible so that conflicts of interest are reduced and it can remain as impartial arbiter.\n\n\nConcerning taxes, I think we could improve the voluntaryiness of the system by converting them to membership fees, where congress levies membership fees on each of the 50 states, and the states levy membership fees on each of their counties. On the county level, I would prefer taxes to be collected via 'land value taxation' rather than income taxation. I would also support a constitutional ammendment which grants local counties the right to secede from the 50 regional states, and join neighboring states or form new states within the US federal system, so that residents can obtain better representation in their state government and the House of Representatives, Senate, and electoral college.\n\nIf democratic social programs are provided by the central government rather than by non-government institutions, I would prefer for revenues to be raised and allocated on the county level. When revenues are raised at the national level on a citizen in one part of the country to be spent on the other side of the country people are too detached from control over the raising and allocation of shared resources, making government less voluntary.
Fines which fund government operations are clearly taxes: payment is compulsory, enforced coercively, and revenues are extracted. Fees are still taxes if they are either unavoidable or levied by government on a peaceful and non-violent activity which it has no right to exercise a monopoly on or for access to property which it is not the legitimate owner of.\n\n> Its critical to understand the nature of the different methods of raising revenue so we can have better discussions about funding commonly owned infrastructure without the use of robbery.\n\nA decentralized land-value tax and pigouvian tax on pollution is capable of funding infrastructure. It is a fine on harming others through excessive enclosure of common lands or coercively excluding others from access to natural resources that is both compatible with libertarian ethics and a tax. Taxes are libertarian as long as they are levied against aggressive property rights violations and not against peaceful and nonviolent individuals.
A basic lesson of economics is that people respond to incentives. If government policies create large scale perverse incentives that lead people to make bad decisions on a massive scale, most libertarians would consider this to be a negative misallocation of resources.
No, it's still not. It's just giving somebody's money back to them.
> They do exist, and they exist to enforce the terms of the contract, be it dischargeable or non-dischargeable.\n\nUS courts generally do not enforce debts resulting from voluntary private transactions as non-dischargable. The only non-dischargable private debts which courts currently enforce that libertarians agree with are fines and restitution resulting from judgements. Other non-dischargable debts include incomes taxes, which are payed to the government rather than a private actor, and which libertarians generally consider to be non-contractual and illegitimate, and child support payments, which many libertarians believe are non-contractual and coercive if both partners did not formally agree to raise the child together.\n\nStudent loans are the big exception, and private student loans were generally dichargable prior to 1984. There is no reason to believe that courts would have enforced private student leads as non-dischargable had the federal government not decided to increase its intervention into the education market.\n\n> A private lender can easily obtain a judgement allowing them to garnish wages\n\nNot after bankruptcy unless its a student loan. Laws should be general and abstract, known and certain, and equally applicable to all people. Carving out a special exemption for student loans violates these principles\n\n> That is, this is a transfer, not an economic loss.\n\nIt's possible for monopolistic advantage to create economic loss even if the monopolist who possesses an unnatural advantage is able to profit. Here the monopolistic advantage is acquired by the state, so it's really a very simple thing for libertarians who want to minimize the power of the state to oppose.\n\n> Or with voluntary transactions?\n\nThe total utility acquired by an individual as a result of a sequence of voluntary transactions varies depending on the frequency and volume of the transactions and the degree to which each transaction satisfied that individual's present needs. It is possible for there to be multiple, mutually exclusive sequences of purely voluntary transactions which satisfy an individual's needs at differing levels of efficiency. If the efficiency at which needs are satisfied is especially low, there will still be some volume of voluntary transactions, but not enough to achieve positive economic growth and expand the economy.\n\nIf given two alternate scenarios which were both considered technically voluntary, I think most libertarians would prefer to live in the scenario where economic growth was more rapid and the power of the state decreased. If a federal subsidized student loan program increases the total proportion of resource allocation decision in a society which the central government is responsible for, I think small government advocates and minarchists can oppose it upon that reason alone.
When there are no longer large scale non-libertarian government policies in place creating perverse incentives in the education marketplace.
Massie is anti-leaks?\n\nI might disagree with him here. The Trump-Russia stuff is genuinely plausible and should be investigated. Having Trump and the defense establishment remain unaligned may actually be a good thing. Flynn was also a major anti-Iran hawk.
If subsidized prices did not actually create incentives affecting consumption, then most economic laws would be invalid and the free market would not actually work. The fact that price signals lead to changes in individual behavior is actually an essential point for pro-free market arguments.\n\nIt is in the self-interest of libertarians who are smart enough to know that such deals are a terrible investment to change the coercive and interventionist government policies which are incentivizing people to take them.
> After all, won't justice just go to the highest bidder in that case, if you turn legal services into an economic good? \n\nNo, justice would go to the friends and family of the owners and shareholders.\n\n> But under which system are the rich more powerful? Under the current system or under anarchy?\n\nPrivatizing the provision of justice services is likely to result in monarchy, not anarchy.\n\n> But, under the current system, the power of the rich is magnified.\n\nBut the power of political rulers are constrained. If courts are no longer provided by a public democratic institution, and are instead provided by private organization, then the private owners of the courts will be effectively above the law and immune from prosecution, as they will have no rational incentive to prosecute themselves and their family members.\n\n> Whereas, if you were the head of some private protection agency and I'm trying to get you to do something that costs a million dollars, I'd have to bribe you more than a million.\n\nIf the head of the private protection agency knows you have 1 million dollars, he can just steal it from you and throw you in jail without charges if you complain.\n\n> Medieval Iceland\n\nWhile the Icelandic Commonwealth had no tax, it still had a central parliament, representative government, negative externalities such as complete deforestation, destructive blood feuds, and slavery,\n\n>  but still, if someone has harmed you, you have a claim to compensation from that person.\n\nIf the courts are privately provided and you raise a claim against the court provider, they are not going to enforce it. If the private court providers can get away with it, they will rob and threaten anyone who challenges their situation.\n\n
If an owner subjectively values theft and plunder they will better satisfy their preferences by engaging in aggressive coercion rather than by doing what is best for voluntary customers. You cannot make free market assumption that firms will avoid engaging in aggressive coercion to satisfy their preferences unless the disincentive discouraging them from such aggression has already been established.
Taxation allows for fees and fines to be assigned to property rights violations in order to disincentivize the aggressive initiation of force. Fees and fines on criminals are taxes if any portion of them is used to fund the operating cost of courts, and they are coercive if it is against the will of criminals to pay them, but they are non aggressive if they are only issued in a defensive manner in response to existing property rights violations rather than used in an aggressive manner to initiate new ones.
I described three sources of revenue and gave you a wikipedia link covering geolibertarianism, which is a libertarian variant emphasizing a Georgist land value tax on the unimproved rental value of land.\n\nA land value or location tax on the unimproved value of land has been extremely well studied by economists since the 1700s, and was advocated by Turgot, Adam Smith, David Ricardo, Henry George, Winston Churchill, and many others.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Land_value_tax\n\nMilton Friedman referred to it as the 'least bad tax'\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yS7Jb58hcsc\n\nUnlike consumption and income taxes, a land value tax does not create economic inefficiency and deadweight loss.\n\nAdditionally, it is well known that people satisfy their own needs more efficiently than they are able to satisfy the needs of others when allocating resources. Raising and allocating resources on the local whenever possible, rather than raising it on the national level and then giving it back to the localities, will ensure that people have more direct political control over how shared resources are collected and allocated and have greater freedom to vote with their feet. This is why membership fees are important. The federal tax code could be greatly simplified if there were only 50 taxpayers: the states with representatives in Congress.
> with people saying how great socialism is\n\nThere have been capitalism vs socialism debates on this subreddit since the beginning of reddit.\n\nLibertarian socialists actually have a longer history of referring to themselves as libertarians than do libertarian capitalists.
I think there is potential for open source software developers to develop a competing digital currency by using prize competitions and bug bounties as a mechanism for monetary expansion. New units of currency would be printed to reward developers who complete public prizes related to building out the digital currency infrastructure. Winners of public prizes would be recognized by proof-of-stake voting among currency holders to determine the wallet address that the new units of currency are issued to.\n\nMonetary expansion could be tied to improvements in the value of a currency if it was tied to completion of work which improves the value of currency as recognized by currency stakeholders which have a rational incentive to avoid frivolous expansion.\n\nDigital currency stakeholders will always need to fund development efforts anyway and disputes among developers over the direction of a currency will still always have some degree of politics. The above proposal would formalize it and use it as a method for monetary expansion.
Under the scenario in which the federal government levies membership fees upon the states and does not directly tax individuals or businesses, Congress can render financial assitance to a state by simply charging it for a lower proportion of the total national expenditures. The state could then choose to either decrease the tax burden on its counties or to keep the tax burden the same and increase spending on social programs.
The problem is that when Trump repeatedly lies over and over he is convincing his followers to only get their news from him. This is what cult leaders do to control their followers. He is telling people not to read specific sources of news which have shown they are willing to demonstrate how he is lying . If he succeeds in training his followers not read the sources of news that are critical of him it will allow him to get away with more and more questionable behavior without accountability.
Do you consider non-anarchist minarchists who advocate for the smallest possible state to be either statist, liberal, or conservative?
If we used range voting for elections, or a specific third party promised to pass voting reform which eliminated the spoiler effect, I don't think there would be  as many excuses.
> private contract cities where everyone entering to sell will have agreed to the entry contract\n\nIf the owners of the private city have monopoly on the final ownership of land, and can deny residents the right to secede from their rule, can use force to prevent residents from appropriating land owned by the city, and can use force to prevent areas of the city from leaving their jurisdiction and taking the land with them, then your proposal is still 100% a proposal for statism. If all of the private cities are sovereign states not under control by an external democratic hegemon or higher hierarchy of democratic government, this is likely result in much greater violations of civil liberties than under a more democratic system where bad leaders can at least be deposed non-violently. \n\nIf we want a free market of competing cities and states, it needs to occur within a hierarchical federal system that guarantees freedom of movement so people can actually move between cities and vote with their feet. If there are different barriers of entry to each private city and no freedom of movement then people can't actually vote with their feet and the private cities are not actors which will be competing in a free market manner.\n\nIf we want to maximize the ability of people to vote with their feet, we should introduce a federal constitutional amendment which guarantees a right of secession to counties so that they may secede from the 50 regional states and join neighboring states or create new states within the federal system, and convert all taxes levied by higher heirarchies of government into membership fees levied by lower heirarchies of government. This way all tax policy can be implemented on the county level and city-state sized regions can pay membership fees to higher heirarchies of government on behalf of their residents, with no direct federal taxation of individuals or businesses.\n\nIf you break up all public democratic government in order to replace it with system of sovereign private city states, you will not have solved any of the core problems of statism, and you will still be placing the sovereignty of the state over the sovereignty of the individual.
Concerning your last claim that money can be printed by an automated factory, are you advocating that this can be done using Friedman's k-percent rule, or is there a different rule which you believe should be followed?
While the media as a whole makes many mistakes, the average reporter as an individual is nowhere near as dishonest as Trump. If he had figured out how to stop lying he might have had a chance to salvage the credibility of his presidency with independents but he keeps doubling down on claims he can't back up. The largest ever inauguration crowd size claim, the 5 million illegal vote claim, the largest electoral college margin victory since Reagan claim, etc.
If education were more affordable no one would have to take out a loan to be educated. Subsidized loans decrease affordability by creating a pass through effect on the cost of tuition that is greater than other methods of financial aid such as grants.
> The individual states deciding is just as wrong as the fed deciding in my opinion\n\nI think in terms of actual consequences, it would be a lot better if states decided. Since we have guaranteed freedom of movement between the states, there is a natural incentive for people to move to states with better drug policies and for states to adopt better drug policies in order to remain competitive and attract skilled labor which might flee to states with better policies and quality of life. I believe this process will be sped up if it were legalized federally. A lot of 'law and order' types in conservative states are simply for marijuana remaining illegal because it is against the law and the people who use it are criminals, as circular as that sounds.\n\nIf we did not have freedom of movement between the federal states and were instead discussing sovereign nation states I would agree with you. However because the federal states cannot restrict freedom of movement between each other I think things play out a bit differently in practice. Although it is still completely up to the states to regulate alcohol, the systematic harm created by prohibitionist policies has been greatly reduced.
>  or even a "Commons Rent" to use a Geolibertarian term, is not a Tax\n\nA commons rent is certainly a tax if the overhead for administering its collection and distribution is taking out of the revenue collected, and it is administered by the central governing authority which is also responsible for providing courts and laws. The most popular variant, the 'land value tax', is called a tax for a reason.\n\n> You seem to be under the false impression that 100% of revenue collected by a government is a tax.\n\nIf its ability to collect a specific type of revenue is dependent upon its status as a central monopoly with the authority to provide laws and courts, then yes that revenue should be considered a tax.
> States rights are a dangerous concept\n\nI am explicitly advocating *against* the right of the states to assert permenant borders and ownership of land. Allowing counties to secede from the 50 regional states in order to allow residents to form new states within the US federal system would decrease rather than increases the ability of the existing 50 states to pass coercive laws against minorities.\n\n> I generally support "open borders" but be careful with the notion of full open borders. You do that and the notion of borders becomes meaningless and thus competition between states disappears\n\nFreedom of movement is a prerequisite for 'voting with feet'. If you can't move then you can't vote and you can't leave and you don't actually have a say. If you can't leave then your argument that taxation is voluntary because people 'can just leave' falls apart completely.\n\nWhile open borders between sovereign nation states whose members live under seperate legal systems may be impractical, open borders and completely free movement between the 50 states within the United States are an essential part of its governing structure. However, the ability to freely move within the United States also does not support your assertion that taxation is voluntary unless moving within the United States actually allowed people to be subjected to differing tax codes.\n\nI am not advocating for 'open' vs 'closed' borders, what I am advocating for is 'voluntary' vs 'coercive' borders. I am advocating for borders which  are continuously readjusted and refactored via an established legal process founded upon mutual consent, rather than static state borders which ruling authorities assert are permanent for all time until they fall apart during violent conflict.\n\n> I believe states have the right to vet and deny certain people.\n\nIf we are discussing the 50 states within the United States federal system, then no they do not.
> Well, it's technically neither taxation nor theft is someone steals property (not their property) from criminals to return it to the rightful owner.\n\nIf the recovering entity is a government and it takes a % cut from the property recovered to cover its operating cost, it's a tax.
> of private property claims: land\n\nI generally advocate for a geolibertarian system of property rights and view land and capital as distinct categories of property. I think private ownership of capital is legitimate as long as it is the product of someone's labor. Natural resources such as land, air, and water are not the products of anyone's labor because they are natural phenomena which pre-existed man. Claiming to have final ownership of movable capital and site improvements such as homes, offices, and factories is different to claiming to have final ownership of land, air, and water. The later category of goods are 'natural' in the sense that they were not the products of anyone's labor.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geolibertarianism\n\n> if we recognize final goods as private property, doesn't that statement include capital goods?\n\nSocialists, communists, left-libertarians and many anarchists draw an ethical distinction between the two even if capitalists, liberals, right-libertarians, and geolibertarians do not. Many variants of socialism allow for the possession of the former, which might include goods such as clothes and shoes, by referring to it as 'personal property'.\n\nWhile there are strict communitarians who don't believe people are allowed to own their own shoes, I think most variants of anarchism and socialism actually allow for private property here by calling it 'personal property'. I would argue that personal property which many socialists and left-anarchists support really is a form of 'private' property, or at least 'non-public' property, because the final owner of your shoes is an individual rather than the state or the community. FInal ownership means that you are the highest authority on access and use. For something like shoes it means it is ultimately up to you to determine who can wear them and others cannot wear them without your consent.\n\n> It seems to me that the only dispute at the present state of theory is to what extent people can own land.\n\nI think this dispute is between right-libertarians + conservatives who support permenant ownership of parcels of natural goods via the principle of original appropriation, and classical liberals + geolibertarians + socialists who believe that the extent to which people can own land is somewhat dependent upon how this affects others. The socialists and communists are still independently very concerned with the extent to which people can be said to privately own capital. Most anarchists seem to lean towards socialism and communism and are also concerned with private ownership of capital.\n\n

The image rivals far more expensive cameras but ergonomically it's terrible, like all DSLRs. You have to really kit it out to get something that isn't a pain to shoot on.\n\nThe only two things really holding back its image from being effectively equivalent to an Alexa in all circumstances is the color depth and the rolling shutter. If the A7s III has far reduced rolling shutter and can export 10-bit or even better 12-bit through HDMI then the difference between expensive cameras and cheap cameras will no longer be visual quality, but ergonomics.
> Like the camera you were renting from them...?\n\nYes. It was an SR III.\n\n>Cause not offering a dummy load at a prep seems... weird. \n\nI agree. They said they barely ever rent 16mm cameras anymore. They did have 35mm rolls. This was two years ago, btw, I imagine it's worse now.\n\n>I wouldn't feel comfortable renting a film camera having not run it,\n\nI wasn't either, but what can you do. We did wind up having a problem with one mag, too, that we might have found at prep if they had a dummy roll.\n\nAnother in a long list of reasons why I tell any director who suggests it not to use 16mm anymore for indy stuff. It's not remotely worth it when there are such great digital cameras available today.
> He is literally listening to the intelligence agencies that you all were yelling at him to listen to.\n\nCite?\n\nThere have been no fatal terror attacks in the U.S. by immigrants from the 7 banned countries.\n\nTrump and his supporters are simply wrong about the threat. There's no excuse as this information is readily available on the internet.
Critiquing the political opposition is an important thing for any ideological movement to do.\n\nIf you have proof liberals or conservatives or anybody is full of shit about something, we want to see it!
>when he started laying his horn on him for no reason, then got over to his right side and spat on his passenger window.\n\nSounds like your husband was driving slower than the flow of traffic in the passing/left lane, which is both dangerous and, in many states, illegal (regardless of the road's speed limit). Tell him to drive to the right unless currently passing a slower car.\n\n>Without sounding lame, is this really because he's driving a hybrid?\n\nWhat makes you think that?
The whole point of the House of Reps is to give localities representation in the federal legislature. Representatives represent specific areas of a state, not a state in general. That's why it's that chamber is so much bigger than the Senate.
There's a difference between "believing in global warming" and thinking the governments of the world can solve so we have to give them more of our money and liberty and if we don't it'll be the day after tomorrow 
I'll let you in on a secret! The reason people have trouble telling you what the key ingredients to the "film look" are is because there aren't any key ingredients, because there's no such thing as a "film look" in reality, and everyone has different ideas of what it might mean in their head.\n\nThere are only two things that visually separate _all_ film stocks from _all_ digital cameras today. They occur at the acquisition stage because of the nature of digital vs. chemical recording of light. The first is the use of subtractive color vs. additive color. Even the lowly A7s includes in-camera settings to replicate this, but any competent colorist can replicate the look with any camera because it only involves altering the relationship between luminance and saturation. The second is grain which is easily achieved with the many free samples of various film stock's grain available online that you can layer over your footage.\n\n100% of the time, when I hear the term "film look" the speaker is not talking about those things, which means their use of the term "film look" is referring to some idea in their head that can't necessarily be translated as "Kodak Vision3 500T" or "Fuji 8427 reversal." Those stocks look quite different, but both could be called "film looks."\n\nFWIW, my absolute favorite out-of-the-box look comes from the various reversal film stocks, which are very contrast and saturated and thus most people would not consider that a "film look" if I replicated it exactly on a digital camera which is stupid and shows how useless the term is.\n\nIn many circumstances, well-graded A7s footage and Alexa footage can be mistaken for each other even by experienced cinematographers very familiar with each camera. The A7s achieves superior resolution and noise performance with sufficient color detail to be effectively equivalent in many circumstances to the Alexa's color detail on most 8-bit displays when properly graded.

I think one major reason to expand and grow the business is to increase her ability to pay employees benefits. Business revenue:expenses doesn't scale perfectly with growth from 0. Often you need a certain economy of scale before you can easily do things like that. Never having run a business Sanders might not know this.

Union membership isn't (and shouldn't be) a protected class as it's voluntary. Besides, many libertarians, myself included, don't believe there should be such a thing as a protected class.

She needs 7 people to service the demand for her service.\n\n> If she got 10% decreased taxes, what would she do? Nothing.\n\nDepends on what her competition does. If she has no competition, that's true, and why monopolies are bad. If she does have competition, doing nothing would almost always put her out of business. Basic economics.
I don't think you read the whole CATO article. The results of the 1996 reform were merely one data point among many.\n\nYour study doesn't study the overall long-term fiscal impact. It just notes that immigrants tend to use welfare more, which was never in question.\n\nThe fact is immigration is good for the country fiscally and economically.\n\nBeing anti-immigration and pro-immigration can both be supported by the concept of freedom of association, so that's irrelevant.

Courts require the same infringements. Regulation, when done ethically, merely removes the need for the court to correct an error after-the-fact. It's raising your hand to actively block a blow instead of taking the punch and then punching back. I am not an AnCap and I don't think most people on /r/libertarian are. Why do you say "we"?\n\nMoreover, the NAP is not the end-all and be-all of ethics like AnCaps pretend it is. The NAP is a very useful framework for libertarian ethics, but it is not the only theory of ethics worth considering.
> I think this situation may be more dangerous than the cuban missile crisis.\n\nAs bad as the possibility of Trump colluding with Russia is, it's not as bad as the potential for Nuclear Armageddon that was the fear during the Cuban Missile Crisis.
That doesn't support the statement that Trump is merely following the intelligence community's recommendations.\n\nAnd it doesn't support the belief that those seven countries pose a unique threat that can be addressed by a temporary ban on visas.

> by every possible statistic there is an acute disparity in deaths by guns in countries where they are available willy nilly, than where it is restricted to police or regulated hunting.\n\nThere is no correlation between restrictive firearm laws and _homicide_. Gun control proponents always use the misleading term "gun deaths" in order to skip around this problem. I don't believe that most people are concerned with the particular _method_ somebody chooses for suicide. Suicide should be kept separate in these debates but never is by the gun control side, because they are dishonest.\n\nhttp://www.factcheck.org/2012/12/gun-rhetoric-vs-gun-facts/
I chose PRK over LASIK for military-flight-related reasons and in my own research didn't find any empirical data suggesting LASIK or PRK had consistently better outcomes.

Because corporations aren't people. They shouldn't be taxed at all. It doesn't make sense to tax a non-living entity, such as a corporation or a lamp.

>yes, urban areas. like everywhere else in this world.\n\nNo, specific urban areas. Remove 4-5 specific urban centers from the stats (though I forget now which ones they are), and our stats are identical to yours. We have dozens of major cities, only certain ones are a problem. The fix for our homicide rate lies in the obsolete and insane drug laws and sentencing practices of those areas.\n\n>like i said, our societies are not fundamentally different.\n\nYou have not sufficiently toured the U.S. if you think that. There are a huge number of variations in culture and law between cities in the same state, not to even mention between whole states. There are many places in the United States that are no more comparable to Western Europe than any other place in the world. Sure, the typical downtown urban centers in America really aren't all that different from any city in Western Europe, but they are not the sources of the higher homicide rate. Comparing them accomplishes nothing more than comparing Bangladesh and Warsaw. It's irrelevant. The areas that push our average up have nothing in common with Western Europe at all.\n\n> you can cherry-pick your information, but fundamentally you are trying to side-step the primary issue. with the availability of a gun, there is a much larger rate of violent crimes with death or injury, simply because you can shoot a guy.\n\nI guess anything that disagrees with your prejudice is "cherry-picked." One of us is basing his opinion on peer-reviewed academic studies from major organizations, and the other isn't.\n\n>you can call me a snob all day and that fact won't change\n\nThe fact that you have done nothing but say I'm wrong without ever engaging with the empirical data I've presented you, much less providing your own, is why I'm calling you a snob. You claimed American society is fundamentally more violent, I showed you data from the UN that stated otherwise, and you stick your fingers in your ear and say "lalalalala I can't hear you! You're wrong you're wrong you're wrong!" Like a child.
>Uh, I didn't argue for upending the world economy to support my pet spending program.\n\nUBI would be enormously expensive to function as its proponents want. It would absolutely involve upending the world economy.\n\nSure, it's possible that in the future, UBI will somehow become a logical path. Anything's possible.\n\nUBI is like religion for some people. Sure, it's _possible_ that the Christian god exists. Is it likely? No. There is no more reason to believe in that god than there is to believe in the existence of Zeus or Thor.\n\nUBI is something these people want _so badly_ that they forget to apply the same rational standards to it that they would for other "futurist" concepts. It's entirely possible that UBI will happen. It holds the same degree of likelihood that about a million other possibilities hold, but many people only want to talk about UBI.\n\nI'm not going to devote time to thinking about UBI any more than I would to thinking about what uploading my consciousness to a computer when I'm 50 would feel like. Both are pretty unlikely to happen, so it's a waste of time to think about them.

> But lately there are these hackey "liberals are wrong!" Articles being posted.\n\nThose are just as important as the "conservatives are wrong" articles.

I say that as someone who'd love to delete 50% of the current government.
> normalish cars now do 5.5 seconds.\n\nNormal cars do not do 0-60 in 5.5 seconds. The 2016 Honda Civic EX Sedan, perhaps the definition of normal, does 0-60 in 8.3.
Expanding on the other answers: this is actually a fantastic example of the difference between how computers work and how our brain works.\n\nIn order for a computer to throw a ball to a spot, it would need to do a bunch of math.\n\nOur brain needs trial and error but never has to do math.
> They're not poor because the relevant regulating authority demands that their factory needs a discombulator with a rated output of 12 units of x per y\n\nThey're poor because they don't have good jobs, and they don't have good jobs because unnecessary and expensive regulations that mostly hurt small businesses (not large corporations) stand in the way of those jobs being created.

You're angry at _me_, but I am only citing the conclusions of a very respected organization. See the above link.\n\n>makes yours a much more violent and unpredictable one.\n\nThis is simply a factually incorrect statement, assuming you're from a Western European country as your stereotypically snobby and uninformed attitude suggests (you guys really need to work on being less predictable).\n\nYou can read _Criminal Victimisation in\nInternational Perspective_ from the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime for a look at the relative "dangerousness" of many countries.\n\nhttp://www.unicri.it/services/library_documentation/publications/icvs/publications/ICVS2004_05report.pdf\n\n>Contrary to common perception, overall rates of volume crime – such as burglary, robbery and assault & threats – are not higher in the USA than in most parts of Western Europe. In fact USA rates are significantly lower than those of, for example, Ireland and England & Wales.\n\nWhat Europeans never understand about gun homicides in the U.S. is that they are overwhelmingly concentrated in a few geographic areas and almost entirely gang or drug related. The vast majority of the U.S., geographically and population speaking, experiences similar homicide rates to Western Europe.

Neither does a "corporation." The people who make up the corporation do, and they should pay the taxes.\n\nA corporate tax is just an indirect tax on the employees and consumers, anyway. Whatever money is taxed out of the fictional entity "the corporation" before it makes it's way to the employees is either less money the corporation has to pay employees or more money consumers have to pay for it's products. It isn't "free money" for the government. Somebody's paying it.

> The subject key is to his left side almost slightly from behind. It is definitely diffused, pretty soft actually.\n\nCamera-right, but it's not from behind him. It's about 45° away from the camera (aka a 3/4 key). The stronger light on the edge of his face and nose is a kicker, it's not the same source that is lighting most of his face, and it's not the same source that is rimming the camera-left side of his head (that is probably from the background). Look at the nose, that tells you everything.\n\n>To the right side of the subject is heavy negative fill.\n\nCamera-left.\n\nThe lighting is probably a large soft source camera-right, a large black solid camera-left, and a kicker in the background camera-right. That's probably it.\n\nThe key could be either a bounce from strong sunlight somewhere (probably not the background, but idk the set layout) or an HMI through large diffusion. I'd guess an M18 through 8x8 1/2 grid in that case.

> dropped on military installations to demonstrate our capacity\n\nThat's what we did: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_bombings_of_Hiroshima_and_Nagasaki#Choice_of_targets\n\n>Hiroshima, an embarkation port and industrial center that was the site of a major military headquarters. . . . At the time of its bombing, Hiroshima was a city of both industrial and military significance. A number of military units were located nearby, the most important of which was the headquarters of Field Marshal Shunroku Hata's Second General Army, which commanded the defense of all of southern Japan,[107] and was located in Hiroshima Castle. Hata's command consisted of some 400,000 men, most of whom were on Kyushu where an Allied invasion was correctly anticipated.[108] Also present in Hiroshima were the headquarters of the 59th Army, the 5th Division and the 224th Division, a recently formed mobile unit.[109] The city was defended by five batteries of 7-cm and 8-cm (2.8 and 3.1 inch) anti-aircraft guns of the 3rd Anti-Aircraft Division, including units from the 121st and 122nd Anti-Aircraft Regiments and the 22nd and 45th Separate Anti-Aircraft Battalions. In total, an estimated 40,000 Japanese military personnel were stationed in the city.[110] . . . . Hiroshima was a minor supply and logistics base for the Japanese military, but it also had large stockpiles of military supplies.[111] The city was also a communications center, a key port for shipping and an assembly area for troops.[76] It was a beehive of war industry, manufacturing parts for planes and boats, for bombs, rifles, and handguns; children were shown how to construct and hurl gasoline bombs and the wheelchair-bound and bedridden were assembling booby traps to be planted in the beaches of Kyushu.\n\nFrom Truman's diary:\n\n>This weapon is to be used against Japan between now and August 10th. I have told the Sec. of War, Mr. Stimson, to use it so that military objectives and soldiers and sailors are the target and not women and children. Even if the Japs are savages, ruthless, merciless and fanatic, we as the leader of the world for the common welfare cannot drop that terrible bomb on the old capital [Kyoto] or the new [Tokyo]. He and I are in accord. The target will be a purely military one.[81]

> Putting a temporary pause on immigration from certain regions until we can reign in and actually enforce and establish our current immigration laws\n\nExcept that is not what is happening.\n\nFirst, this is not a "temporary pause on immigration." It involves actually expelling people who _already immigrated_ and indefinitely suspends immigration from one country. The foreign nationals chosen for this treatment have _never shown themselves to be any danger to the U.S._\n\nSecond, if you think Trump's going to make any meaningful reforms that will do a better job of rooting out the (already non-existent) terrorists on visas, you're mad. We already enforce our current laws and we are already safe, you just don't like immigration.

Similarly, he could say that Popeyes must only sell chicken legs and nothing else, but nothing would happen except everyone thinking he's an idiot.\n\n>Well, if things work correctly, either Congress or the Supreme Court, or both, will put a stop to that.\n\nThey wouldn't need to, technically, because there wouldn't be anything to put a stop _to._\n\nThe President does not exercise any authority over elections, at all. For the obvious reason.\n\n>State law, not federal, regulates most aspects of the elections, including primaries, the eligibility of voters (beyond the basic constitutional definition), the running of each state's electoral college, and the running of state and local elections.

Most experts (actual economists) think UBI is a dumb idea, because not only is it an inefficient welfare system, there is no evidence to support the idea that automation _this time_ will eliminate jobs on the aggregate.

The actual answer was FDR was economically retarded, introduced price controls on labor and companies used healthcare as an extra incentive to get people to work for them since they couldn't raise wages.

Libertarians would like to eliminate the welfare state. Tuckers argument was there is no way we are eliminating the welfare state in our current state, securing the border is easier. \n\nEliminating the Welfare State should definitely be done. The migrants went all the way to Sweden because of the welfare benefits not for safety.  Eliminate public schools privatize or decentralize everything, when he had immigrants by the millions we had 0 in the welfare State. 
I'm concerned about the liberals in this sub calling Trump aides and Russian conversations "treason" and are not more concerned about The Deep State tapping and listing to all conversations between U.S. citizens and foreigners and then leaking that information because they feel they are under threat.

On the contrary, they led the more modern fight to recognize it and ensure that Americans don't forget. \n\nO please its the last thing on their mind when bringing him up and slavery is the first thing when talking about the Founders.\n\n>They just are able to separate it from the things they liked about FDR, namely the New Deal\n\nWhich they only like thanks to public school aka liberal nationalism indoctrination centers. \n\nThe New Deal extended the Great Depression and was horrible in every way. \n\n>This is the same as libertarians and conservatives separating the things they like from Jefferson (liberty, free market) from the stuff they are mortified by (having slaves and raping them).\n\nSee above. \n\n

Crimea was always part of Russia, it was given to Ukraine when they were part of Russia in a drunken act the leader of the USSR at the time gave it to Ukraine because they were apart of Russia. After they split the Crimean people have wanted to leave Ukraine and have resolutions to do it for decades. Then a CIA and State dept backed coup overthrew the elected government in Ukraine and installed a puppet government picked by the State Department (audio between State department and ambassador of Ukraine is on YouTube discussing this media didn't care)

>Ron was a regular rubber stamp while on his various committee assignments\n\nSource on this utter bs?
If you want the actual answer it's the Unelected bureaucracy of the CIA FBI State Department that doesn't change from one administration to the next. They are the ones really controlling our government. Ron Paul has talked about this extensively, it's nothing new and has been around for decades. The new leaks are coming from those sources as they would be the only ones with access to these transcripts and the names in these transcripts. They want wars, nation building, and a host of other things that drain the wealth of the American people and transfer it to the military industrial complex.

the difference is Trump is the elected leader, the CIA is part of the CIA, Trump can bash the CIA all he wants and that gives the CIA no authority to release phone calls of private citizens. 
A bill is an itemized list stating services used with cost. The government just demands a portion of my income without my consent or itiemized list. More closer to Mob extortion than a bill
Okay replace CIA with NSA and it's the same point, unless that PDF says it's okay for them to tap private citizens phones then leak the content to the press.
But muh State Department said we had no involvement in the Ukrainian coup, what that audio tape that shows we clearly did? RUSSIANS LEAKED IT REEEEEEEEEEEEEEE. 
hes wrong on one thing its not Obama's shadow government, Obama served the shadow government. 
>Well said. This obsession with the liberal bogeyman, who has no ideals and just loves the government, is ridiculous. \n\nLeftist are people who love the government and want to give it more power, so long as "their guy" is in charge. They were all praising Sanders as the next FDR, so excuse us on the anniversary of FDR locking innocent Americans in camps for their race we criticize the group that praises him and wants the State to have more power for free shit. 
This has been explained countless times, his constituents get their money stolen through Federal Income tax. He rather the government not spend that money and always offers up budgets that don't. He could not use any earmarks, in that case his constituents money still gets stolen and they get nothing in return. Instead he puts in the earmarks, votes against the bill with them in it, but when the government does decided to spend needlessly his constituents still get something out of it. \n\nSo do you have any specifics or are you just repeating 10 year old criticisms of Dr. Paul with no basis. 
GOP and convince the DNC to come on a helicopter ride with me in celebration. 
He also changed the rules last minute in 2012 to complete Fuck over Ron Paul not letting him speak and letting some of his delegations in. Not to mention helping rig some of the States for Romney, dude is not trustable

Except no libertarian advocates for only using Gold as money which is a key difference, Ron and others argue for competing currencies, but Ron prefers Gold. He could be wrong but that's not for governments to decide its for the market to decide.

The most painful decision:\n\nWhen you are about to finish a neutral camp but you see your team about to engage in a fight.
Got any specifics? Not to mention most require an explanation from Dr. Paul for context, such as when he voted against a resolution to never tax the internet because he felt the government didn't have the authority to tax the internet and it would establish they did. 
If they actually cared they'd spend 10 minutes on YouTube 
Yea Fuck enforcing voluntary contracts and protecting private property.

Net Neutrality entrenches ISP monopolies so they can continue enriching themselves and keeping out competition.\n\nWithout government assistance, ISP's would have competition. They would be forced to provide a good service.\n\nRomania is a poor country and they have had a free market in internet providers. The result? They now have some of the fastests speeds on the planet.\n\nSimilar to how tax evasion is done, Netflix used an ISP to duck out of paying their fair share for internet infrastructure. Streaming high definition videos takes a lot of bandwidth and they set up a system whereby they did not pay their part.\n\nThere are initiatives to provide free wikipedia in Africa. This is a violation of net neutrality.

I dislike Trump for various stances like supporting stop and frisk and civil asset forfeiture.\n\nHowever with Trump you know what you are getting. He actually wrote a 2 page 100 day plan.

I am not.  But when that craptastic show appears on my television, I'm going to rate it to the bottom.
that's because insulting minorities is racist and insulting white people is "deserved" somehow.  I don't get it either...

It is great. \n\nThe range is a cooperation between the state, and a private club.  The public (free) range is separate from the 1,000yd range and has backstops at various distances out to 100yds.\n\nThe 600yd range is open during operating hours to all members.  The 1,000yd range is by appointment only in the mornings because shooters on it actually shoot over the public range and the 600yd line. \n\nThe one downside is that the whole place shuts down in the winter. 
Fuck yeah. \n\nI want some sombrero action.

I'm sure most people have a box of the crappy cable/trigger locks that come with many guns, or just throw them out (that's what I do). \n\nThe CMP could spend several dollars and include a lock with each rifle, or they could spend a few cents on a card for the people that actually want one.  I'd rather see them spend their money on their main mission of promoting marksmanship. \n\nI vaguely remember sending it in just because, and it was a generic cable lock. 
I've got a 7.5" SBR, and it is a really fun and handy rifle.  The downside is that that fucker is loud and puts out one hell of a concussion.  It is miserable if you shoot it in any kind of enclosed space.  \n\nI wouldn't use it on anything outside of 100yds or so.

I never expect to be in and out quickly when buying a gun at Cabela's, especially in PA since they're special snowflakes with PICS.  My last experience in PA was about five hours.  \n\nOne thing to be mindful of is that Cabela's has an obscene amount of checks during the transfer process to protect each store from any mistakes that could cost them their FFL. 
Are we just all going to forget about the second episode?\n\nBecause I'm in favor of that.

High demand, low supply. 
Yes.  Depending on the rail, you'll either completely remove the current barrel nut (and delta ring assembly with it) and use the proprietary nut that comes with the rail, or you'll remove just the delta ring assembly and bolt on the rail to the standard barrel nut.

I'm in WV right along the border.  The closest range is a SGL range in Garards Fort, PA.  My preferred one is a WV public range, but the drive is three times as long. \n\nMy SO's brother got fined for having too many rounds in a rifle, and he was the only one there. \n\nI can understand the rules for if the range is crowded like they usually are before deer season, but if you're all alone, that is some stupid BS.

You can privately sell it online at a site like GunBroker. This can get you the most money, but will be the most work for you. \n\nYou can sell it directly to a gun shop.  This will probably get you the least amount of money, but it will be the least amount of work for you. \n\nA third option is to find a gun shop that will sell it on consignment. They'll hold on to it, you'll get your money when (and if) they sell it, and they'll probably take a percentage.  This is the compromise option where there isn't much work on your end, but you're still waiting on someone to decide to buy.  
This is why you call the police and be a good witness unless the trouble comes to you.

Honestly I think the lack of competition is just the nature of trying to run an ISP in the US due to the massive area and sparse populations across the states while the barrier to entry for the ISP "industry" is incredibly high since it comes down to running physical lines everywhere (or piggybacking off of the bigger ISPs' lines). The return on start-up costs and, in my opinion, inability for newcomers to offer potentially better alternatives to some consumers makes the decision to enter the ISP marketplace a very irrational one with seemingly no payoff. Newcomers can't offer better speeds because of physical/financial limitations, so the appeal could either be better customer service, even lower prices for more basic services, or just by having another company available that isn't Comcast/Verizon/etc.\n\nI do feel some empathy for the big ISPs since they've legitimately invested their time and money (along with a lot of gov't money) into creating all of the infrastructure in the first place, and I don't think anything would be accomplished by breaking them up as they are now or anything. However, their current agenda (data caps and "fast lanes" come to mind) is purely a cash grab and to the detriment of consumers with no free-market alternative to discourage such an agenda. They also lobby incredibly hard (and successfully) against initiatives for municipal internet managed by local governments when those initiatives are backed by local residents, so that's a pain in the ass.
One problem, though: this woman was not married to the doctor that injected her with HIV. She was having an affair with said doctor. Her actual husband's only involvement is testing negative for HIV. The title shouldn't be using spouse and husband to refer to the convicted doctor.
I think the biggest issue with Norway being bad (and to a lesser extent Japan and England) is the coastal starting preference along with sea resources being much worse relative to other land tiles (like Hill Forests or Bananas) in VI compared to how sea resources stacked up to land tiles in V. Also, I think the map generally doesn't worry as much about making sure there are sources of fresh water along the coast compared to the interiors of continents, which also hurts.
I agree with goodbye. Civ VI so far feels like a more fluid, interesting Civ V. There were too few optimal builds almost regardless of overall victory condition or direction, and that's largely due to the happiness restriction limiting cities to the typical 3 to 4 while making sure your National College comes out on time.\n\nIt's been a bit over a day so it's too soon to say there won't be static build orders like in Civ V. I do think that the eureka mechanic which is very map dependent will tend to prevent every playthrough from handling the same on difficulty 7+.
After a couple of hours on Survival, I just changed my playstyle to be pretty much like Dark Souls where beds and sleeping bags are treated like bonfires. If you don't take Endurance perks early, then anyone with a shotgun can easily one-shot you. Personally I prefer it though because the non-survival master difficulty (or Legendary?) has enemies with health that is tediously high, even if you're also tougher as well.
You're totally right about calling these "wizard augments" out as goreshit. The Lore of Wild and Lore of Vampires augments (extra speed and vigor loss, and extra healing respectively) aren't awful, but they are definitely not worth the army resource cost in multiplayer since no spell has a cast time beyond 3 or 4 seconds (I think summons have 5 seconds but they are one-time spells).\n\nHowever I disagree on taking the same passive augments while casting and making them permanent augments b/c it'd be too extreme and would make having one caster more of a requirement than it already is. I believe Wurzzag has an ability which gives about a 20 second buff to all allied units in a big area (or mapwide), and that sort of post-casting buff would be reasonable to give to hero casters.
There's actually fine print betwen AmEx and businesses that is meant to prevent businesses from encouraging customers to use other non-AmEx credit cards. The US Justice Department sued AmEx, and recent updates from the courts uphold the fine print which is technically called a Non-Discrimination Provision. Here is [an article about it](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/27/business/american-express-can-stop-merchants-from-steering-clients-to-other-cards.html?_r=0) for those curious.
If South Park is willing to directly put Pewdiepie on their show, I certainly wouldn't put this past them. This also has easy potential to be a lot better than that Youtube parody was.
[This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1o6-bi3jlxk) is a better source for what Richard Spencer's speech was like. I'll admit I've been skeptical of reportedly racist elements in the alt-right, but the video speaks for itself. This isn't some random Nazi-wannabe group saluting together and incorrectly calling themselves alt-right. [Breitbart itself](http://www.breitbart.com/tech/2016/03/29/an-establishment-conservatives-guide-to-the-alt-right/) states that Spencer founded the site that "would become a center of alt-right thought."\n\nI've been very annoyed by the media implication that a vote for Trump is a vote for racism or misogyny and nothing else, so I've been assuming that the accusations of the alt-right being primarily focused on white supremacy were false. Now having directly heard what they cheer for from the horse's mouth, looks like I was wrong to assume.
You could always play against Venice with zero city-states! :D\n\nIf you want a single opponent, I'd go with some sort of military-based civ like Genghis or Monty since an all-out slugfest seems inevitable.
You can hover over the icons under the stats for units and it gives full details. I think Frenzy in most cases gives +8 weapon strength, +12% weapon damage, +10% charge bonus and immunity to psychology (numbers are close to those) as long as leadership is above 50%.

I think the real question to the ultimate morality of his actions in business and in humanitarian aid is whether all of his wealth, focused on himself, was more helpful than that wealth would be spread out over a large portion of society.\n\nPersonally, I think having a massive portion of wealth focused on an individual can lead to much more organized efforts of humanitarian aid instead of all of it being absorbed into a massively widescale effort like American Cancer Society or Red Cross.
I rationalize net neutrality as a legitimate gov't function as the protection of individuals from behemoth ISPs to go about their business without unnecessary fees/hindrances/drawbacks that **cannot be naturally corrected by competition in the marketplace** (because there's so little and merges with itself often). ISPs are basically a medium to transfer data, and it's wrong for them to impose extra fees, throttle, and/or double dip based on whatever you choose to interact with. The main example that comes to mind is ISPs potentially charging you (the consumer) extra for Netflix access while also charging Netflix extra just b/c. The analogy I like to use is a company that owns private roads around town and charges higher tolls depending on where you choose to go. The other concern for me is the potential for ISPs to restrict or censor content on their own accord, but that's not what they are after right now (they want money) so it's not really an issue with net neutrality but is important to keep in mind.

That's one hell of an exaggerated title to use for an article about one restaurant giving a 5% discount to parents who keep their kids in check. I didn't realize the government regulated prices at restaurants to improve child behavior.
This is what I understand rubberbanding to mean for racing games. It's the same as a "come-back mechanic" like giving blue shells and bullet bills to Mario Kart players in the back.\n\nEDIT: In this case, that might mean slightly increased stats for cars in the back, or the use of a drafting game mechanic to get a speed advantage.
OP likely caught on because this list is sorted by total income, which has Aragon doubling the income of #2 Ottomans.
I agree mostly but disagree with corporations having customer satisfaction as their #1 goal. The drive for profit only encourages companies to improve themselves if the companies have competition from others that risks potential profit. Industries with very little to no competition don't need to try as hard to appease consumers since the consumers have no alternatives (cable industry being a prime example) so they focus on their bottom line at the expense of customers. The same thing can be said of the federal government though. With it being the only government involved in nationwide policymaking and enforcement, there's basically no accountability for them to meet which leads to inefficiency and waste. That's a big part for me preferring 50 states trying 50 things (although entirely state-managed education in the Bible belt concerns me).\n\nGenerally a company has more incentive to please customers than the government (since the government gets money no matter how badly they do) but that increased incentive depends on competition. Just because something is private doesn't automatically make it good or altrustic.
| 25% map wide speed bonus\n\nIf you're talking about Bestial Surge, I've always been under the impression that this ability is garbage. Its cost is 174, and it's active only during casting which is typically 3 seconds at a time (5 for the Cygor summon). I also tend to see players take the Cygor summon as the only spell for Malagor, so it ends up being a useless ability for them after summoning.
> I don't understand your question. In my simplified scenario Johnson got no initial votes.\n\nAfter the first round of voting, Johnson is out as a potential choice since he had the least amount (in this case being no votes). This also means that the vote percentages do not change after eliminating Johnson since there's no votes to reallocate.\n\nIf Johnson is out on the first round, and then Hillary is eliminated, then all of the Hillary voters who had Johnson as #2 would not apply to Johnson. He's already out. Instead those Hillary voters with Johnson as #2 would vote in the third round using their #3 pick, which would likely be Stein. Therefore, Stein wins.\n\nThis falls apart because you're thinking that Johnson can come back after elimination and get votes counted toward him in later rounds of voting, and that is not the case.
Again, this is from what I've gathered online so some things may not be correct or are speculative.\n\nThere's two parts to a charge: impact and the charge effect. When a charging unit collides with its target, it causes a knockback effect and deals impact damage to the target units that get trampled. The amount of impact damage is dependent I think on speed and mass of the charging unit, and it seems to be mostly but not entirely AP. [This post suggests the damage is 70% AP and 30% normal](https://www.reddit.com/r/totalwar/comments/4m9sdw/how_melee_attack_and_defense_armor_and_damage/). Impact damage is straightforward, and I don't believe it's affected by a unit's own weapon damage, melee attack, or charge bonus. The bigger a unit is and the faster it's moving, then the more damage (and knockback I think) it will deal on a charge. This means downhill charges are much more effective than uphill charges, naturally.\n\nAfter the initial impact, the charging unit will be in a "Charging" state which you can see by hovering over the unit. During this time, the charging unit will get a bonus to its melee attack and weapon damage, and I've heard that this bonus decreases over time, but I haven't been able to confirm that. I would say that this bonus seems to last on average about 10 seconds, so generally it's a good idea to stick around for a short time in melee with your charging units to take advantage of the bonus. There are times where you would rather leave immediately of course, like if you charged against units with an anti-large ability or you are being surrounded. Also, a decent rule of thumb for cavalry variants is that units with higher charge bonus should more often be used for cycle charging to take advantage of the bonus more often. Another reason to favor cycle charging with high charge bonus cavalry (typically shock cavalry) is that their melee attack and defense stats can sometimes be worse than their non-shock counterparts, so they don't do well in prolonged combat. Black Knights vs Black Knights with Lances are a good example of this difference in prolonged combat.\n\nThe way this would apply to melee attack and damage is pretty simple. Basically a good charge will temporarily increase your chance of landing a hit shortly after the charge, along with the damage you deal on each hit. Getting a charge on an enemy unit that doesn't charge back can really swing the outcome of a fight, and it's one of the better uses for fast fodder like wolf riders or bats. Hold enemy cavalry in place to break their charge while you send yours into the enemy cavalry.
Crowd Control.\n\nBasically anything that disables or interferes with enemies. Stuns/slows/freezes/knockbacks/etc...
This was a very deceptive amendment that passed the FL Supreme Court on a 4-3 ruling, but it has been known about for months from media sources.

Well I think this is really two questions:\n\n* How do you trim a string?\n\n* How do you trim user input, which is handled as a string?\n\nTrimming whitespace off of a string is fairly straightforward. You just have to call the string's Trim() method, and that will return the string with whitespace knocked off of the beginning and end of the string.\n\nFor trimming whitespace off of user input, just remember that the output of "nextLine()" IS a string, and then you can just call "nextLine().Trim()". So a Java method that trims user input could be like:\n\n    public String getTrimmedTicketCode() {\n        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);\n        System.out.print("Enter your ticket code: ");\n        return scanner.nextLine().Trim();\n    }
Nice write-up.\n\nWhat would you max first, Q or E? Normally I would assume E max for most damage, but I'm not sure if that's changed with the scaling stun duration on Q. Also I assume that starting skill order is mostly Q -> E -> Q/E -> W -> Q/E?
487 up votes for this bullshit? WTF am i missing cause i feel way out of touch.
I think Wurrzag has always been viable (more than the other Greenskin caster lords imo) but I haven't tried him much. He does have Big Waaagh spells, like you mentioned, and he also has the Waaagh ability for the big melee attack bonus along with a global debuff that gives enemy casters an extra 40% chance to miscast.\n\nI think Greenskin archers can definitely be good, but I just like the feel of all melee Greenskin armies vs Brettonia. Also I think it's been mentioned by someone else, but the Night Goblin RoR (Da Warlord's Boyz) apply armor-sundering and can be incredibly strong against Brettonian infantry when paired up with Big Uns or even just regular Gobbos.
I experienced this same thing against Gandhi. He declared early war on me (no idea why, I think it was because of forward expansion toward him), and I fought him back and tried to white peace with him. It's strange though since there doesn't seem to be a clear "Propose" button, so he changed it from white peace to giving me a bunch of gold and peacing out.\n\nDefinitely something that needs smoothing out, probably along with generally keeping leaders more in-line with their agendas.
This is really nitpicky and isn't needed on r/Libertarian (or the other conservative subreddits you put this on). This is you being upset at getting apparently wrongly banned on r/science. You don't even make any attempt to tie this into censorship or Libertarian views on the environment and its protection or anything.\n\nOf the scientific literature that takes a stance on human involvement in global warming, 97% take the stance that humans contribute to global warming to some degree, with 1.6% of the overall actually claiming that humans are the primary cause of global warming. That's a fair distinction to make, and one this study should have made clear. Overall, though, this study still correctly suggests that no more than 3% (I'd say 1.9% specifically) believe humanity has no effect on global warming, which is the main takeaway.
Guess he'll need an archer UU as well.
Considering her view on the dangers of wi-fi, I wouldn't put any value into her opinion on hacked voting machines.\n\nHonestly I think it's a two birds, one stone situation. All of the fired-up people pissed at Trump winning will be able to look to Stein as someone still working to make things "right" so she might get some  more support for a 2020 run if she's planning one. Also her campaign has already exceeded the amount needed for recounts in several states, let alone three. This is from the [funding page](https://jillstein.nationbuilder.com/recount) for this recount effort: "If we raise more than what's needed, the surplus will also go toward election integrity efforts and to promote voting system reform."\n\nBy "promoting voting system reform", I'm guessing that sounds like funding the Green Party so they can campaign their issues, which include voting reform. It may have started only as an attempt to pander to people pissed at the election results, but it's definitely become a cash grab.

If you have the Waaagh ability with a Warboss or something ready then they should be able to take out a lot of Demigryph health, but their leadership and defense stats aren't great and they'll likely route even if they do take out most Demigryph. Also they are susceptible to terror which can get annoying, but for 900 they are very cost-effective cav imo.\n\nAlso, if you can break a Demigryph charge with Wolf Riders and get a charge in with Boar Big Uns, then that can be enough to at least make it an even fight.
Yeah they definitely increased the cost maybe 7 or 8 patches ago, it feels like. It's been a while since I played because of other strategy games that came out this year, but I'd definitely go for the trade negotiation route nowadays, especially if playing as a European power with the final trade nodes.\n\nI'd rather spend the ducats on soldiers than spend military power on purging.
Pretty sure that Talon W doesn't return after death.
I like the article linked to in this one where the defense tries to exclude the main video from the trial because it's "highly prejudicial, inflammatory, and **factually deficient**."\n\nYeah... because video is way more deficient of facts than the word of a police officer vs a dead man.
I don't think hybrid marks are a good idea. All of Akali's abilities are magic damage, and the changes to Lethality seem to make armor pen and hybrid pen marks worse early on. Compare that to decent AD scaling on her passive and her E, along with the fact that she'll be doing a lot of auto-attacking for proccing Qs and passive like always, and AD marks have a clear advantage over all of the pen runes imo.
I wouldn't worry too much about the Lore of Life spells not resurrecting units. I think the big effect of including Lore of Life on Empire will be in being able to fortify a frontline for ranged units to shoot behind. Currently most Empire armies in multiplayer are some combination of Spearmen and Greatswords with RoR thrown in for being exceptional (and unbreakable). Being able to heal those units from the start will give a major resilience to the frontline of a faction which basically has the best ranged units (until Wood Elves come around).\n\nEDIT: Keep in mind that Sigmar's Sons and Flagellants will be the first instance of Unbreakable units (w/o crumbling) that can be healed. I think that's a massive advantage that will potentially be imbalanced.\n\nDespite all of that, you do raise a great point about siege engine healing, but I think the nature of how the code treats healing could play a big difference. Say 30 Swordsmen are wounded from combat but not dead (so they are like at 50 from 110 HP or something). A cast on them would heal some number of HP (called X) per model for X times 30 healing. But it may also heal the same "per model" amount for a swordsmen unit as it does for the Steam tank.
Marbozir comes to mind as a single-player deity Youtuber. Quill18 also has some Civ VI videos, but I don't think he plays as much or as extensively as Marbozir.

You can bring 50 mL bottles of liquor on planes in your quart-sized bag of liquids no problem for US/Canada flights.

I don't think it matters. If there weren't discrimination laws and businesses here and there legally refused service to black people, gay people, Muslims, or anyone else, then I'd expect a massive portion of the market and consumers as a whole to pretty much shit on said business and put them in a much worse spot from backlash. Laws may not technically be needed, but American society isn't going to let serious discrimination slide whether it's legal or not so it's a moot point whether they should exist or not.\n\nEDIT: On a similar note, I think that being libertarian and being okay with the definition of hate crimes and how they increase the severity of crimes would be a much better example of a hypocritical view.
I just started with the same two! I've only dabbled for a couple hours so far but am loving it, especially the Arcade chord progression. If I were to add more, which I'll almost definitely do, I'll probably pick up the Sub and then the Rhythm. They seem to offer more unique sounds than the others. I'm also not sold on the Office just yet, but it's obviously the outlier with very specific sounds.
Excellent video! Also I have to say that "Manlius" may be the best Roman name I've ever heard of.
I agree with Monogame. Monogame is a solid alternative to Unity, but it's a much different approach. I'm using Monogame right now on my own project. It's fairly easy to get started and dive right in, but it's basically entirely code-based and honestly requires more knowledge of C# than the game library itself. Monogame basically provides a game loop and a fairly easy way of rendering sprites, but it's up to you to fill in the gaps and create all of the functionality (UI, characters with stats, etc).\n\nUnity may be better for newer people to game development, but I'm biased toward Monogame because I chose XNA books as my first exposure to programming and I find Monogame to be a lot more customizable. If you're both comfortable with C#, then Monogame may be worth looking into. There are many Monogame tutorials out there (which are really XNA tutorials, they're effectively the same), and it only takes about maybe an hour to delve through a tutorial and have a moving sprite on your screen.
I disagree, and I don't think any single instance will change anything (although I do think enough of them will). It will stir up the public for maybe a couple of weeks, but all of these get largely forgotten until the police involved have investigations on themselves completed or go to trial. It also won't necessarily require a police response or shift in mentality since they can rationalize it however the evidence goes.\n\nThe evidence for the Philando Castile shooting is going to potentially be four things: the testimony of the girlfriend, the testimony of the officer, the video that was livestreamed, and body/dash cam footage. If we assume the testimonies offset each other, then the video taken after the shooting and body cam footage are what remain, and only the body cam footage could show evidence of intent or recklessness by the officer. Either there is no clear body or dash cam footage, so that police supporters can claim lack of evidence for any wrongdoing leading to the shooting, or there is clear evidence of wrongdoing on the cams, in which case police supporters can hang him out to dry and distance themselves by calling him a "bad apple".\n\nI'm afraid it's going to take more than what's happened for police dept's to shift away from what I would call a "pre-emptive shooting" mentality. That's especially true now after the Dallas attack on police.
Hmmmm this is a tricky one. A few of the questions that come to mind are:\n\n* Could a private entity be capable of identifying, confirming, and acting on cases of child abuse without infringing on rights like privacy? How would they maintain accountability, and what would the recourse be for potential false positives?\n\n* How far can a private entity or the government reasonably be allowed to go to identify, confirm, and act on cases of child abuse?\n\n* Are there parts of the whole child services system that could be privatized, i.e. maintain a state department for child and family services but privatize group homes, or use private investigators to look into claims of child abuse and take their findings to gov't?\n\n* Could more charities emerge around this issue to support kids taken from homes for any amount of time? Who would account for these charities?\n\nI think that some elements of the current system could be privatized, and the current system definitely could use a clean-up to avoid false positives and false negatives. Ultimately though, I think there are situations where a child needs to be removed from his or her parents, and the gov't seems like the only entity that should ever be permitted to do so.\n\nEDIT: There is also a flip-side of the gov't potentially forcing teenagers to remain at home with potentially abusive parents. That needs a fix in the system that causes the problem, though. That doesn't require burning the system down.
I assume you mean the tendency of Beastmen or the Savage orc faction to spawn in a campaign, and from my experience, the campaign won't let more than about 3 turns go by without spawning a new instance of Beastmen (under Khazrak) or the Savage Orc tribe (I totally forget the name of the faction but it's teal w/ blue).\n\nI think it's a random occurrence, but I also think they are factions where if the game realizes a faction isn't present, it will immediately re-include the faction into the game somewhere. It may be better to leave a weakened Khazrak or Savage Orc army lingering than to wipe it out and have the game spawn another.
> didn't even kill anyone\n\nI guess we should wait for another 9/11 then before we do something? Hey, let's just open the fucking liberal gates and let whoever the fuck in, right? I'm sure OSU would agree with you on that.
I've only heard confirmations of a Vampire hero getting Lore of Shadows. I scanned some Warhammer wikis about Beastmen and saw that they seem to only get access to Lores of Death, Beasts, and Wild (please correct me if I'm wrong. I hope I am. Also I couldn't get clear info on Chaos b/c there's just too much unstructured info about Warhammer on the internet). They already have access to all three lores mentioned, so I doubt they will receive any more magic than they have currently. It's a shame as well, but I guess Beastmen in Warhammer are just a more exaggerated version of Greenskin where they just depend on super-amplified offensive stats to kill enemies before their lack of defenses result in a weakness.
I haven't seen Wurrzag mentioned yet. He has an ability that can lock down an enemy for a long time while all of your units can kill the target. Basically you can try bringing him along with lots of Big Uns or Boar Big Uns and wait until Louen lands. Then you can use the ability and surround him. Poison units also help keep them from getting away as easily.\n\nPersonally I switch between a mass infantry with wolf riders and a more balanced army with boar big 'uns. I don't know if I would call one strictly better, but I prefer to try and just ignore them and not field a good target for flyers to single out and charge. Bringing Rusy Arrers and other archers to try and deal with them doesn't seem as effective imo.
Thanks for the correction! It looks like you're right. When looking into it, I would find posts saying how it applies to damage, and I took that to mean it applied ONLY to damage. I never thought to look and see if it applied to melee attack as well since the number for bonus vs large appears in the damage breakdown on the unit card.\n\nEDIT: Actually I'm not sure. I've been looking at [this guide which contains more information](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=719168880) and it doesn't seem to mention the bonus vs large/infantry regarding melee attack (although it doesn't mention it for damage either). The tooltips in-game also make it seem like it applies to damage only. I found older forum posts from other TW games saying it applies to both, but I'm not totally sure bonus vs large/infantry applies to both in this game.
I think it depends on what they are stalling with. I see in your picture that it's the Everwatcher, in which case there's basically nothing you can do to keep him from running away. Other situations like Chaos running away with a Hellcannon crew or something are a bit more feasible since there should be enough time to get a surround on enemy units near the edge of the map.
I think the best way to use Savage Orcs would be like how Chaos uses Forsaken. They'll rip apart any low-armor units and are faster than the rest of the Greenskin infantry (and VC infantry as well aside from Crypt Ghouls and Cairn Wraiths), so treating them like the hammer to an anvil of Black Orcs and other infantry might be the most effective way. I will say though that VC infantry tend to have pretty bad melee attack scores, so I personally lean toward the armor and higher melee defense that regular Big Uns get. I suppose you could easily try some of both, using regular Big Uns for more defensive purposes or to hold a frontline while trying to get the Savage ones into an ideal spot to charge from or something.\n\nI did some simple testing right now, and 1v1 a Savage Orc Big Un and a regular Big Un will each beat a Crypt Horror (of course no Invocation of Nehek was used which will change things), and the outcomes were pretty similar. Also I added a Mortis Engine and after the Savage Big Uns start to waver, they do get affected by the fear and terror.
Not that I'm defending the TSA, but did they tell you it was because of something in your pocket which ended up being lint? Or did they just pull you aside and you think it was because of lint? I've had a handful of friends say they've gone through TSA with single pills and things that they've forgotten about.\n\nI had five flights last month, and three times going through security the detector went off. I had nothing on me, but the detector went off anyway for a random search (at least that's what the Canadian TSA told me). Funny enough the CA TSA asked me if I'd be okay with the full body scanner, as if that's more invasive than a patdown. Makes me wonder if they still use the full body scanners that take images instead of superimposing stuff.
I agree with this. Soulblight and Spirit Leech are both good spells, and Aspect of Dreadknight and Doom & Darkness offer good options for messing with morale like was mentioned. I think the only useful spell in the Lore of Metal is Transmutation of Lead, which is actually just a longer-lasting but more expensive Itchy Nuisance. The Metal damage spells are just undertuned, and the spells that affect armor aren't necessarily bad, but they feel really bad to use since it's hard to appreciate the effects and requires units to take advantage of them.
Thanks for checking Cait E and Ori ult. That sounded strange to me that those wouldn't work. After getting knocked into the air, there's no more interruptions to break the channels, and I would assume that in-game "vertical" movement wouldn't count as movement for breaking channels.
It seems that chariots have a better charge and toss units around better, but they don't do as well in prolonged combat, especially if they get caught out by cavalry. I think the big thing is that the boar chariots have a charge bonus of 80 while boar boy big 'uns have a bonus of 46. I think the way charge bonus works is that it applies to the trample as damage as well as some extra melee attack for a few seconds after charging, so chariot charges seem like they do more.\n\nMainly I just like using them when I'm not expecting a lot of faster units and when I can rely on big 'uns instead of boar big 'uns for anti-large. Chariots can be a lot more useful against infantry than either boar boy units. Having said that, I haven't really tried the savage boar boy units. I'm personally not a fan of the lower defenses but they'd be immune to psychology with their Frenzy ability which could be nice against Brettonia for dealing with Louen.\n\nEDIT: Also I think the RoR unit is fine, especially if you have a non-mounted lord and no big bosses. They're definitely good, but do cost 1300, and I personally rather spend an extra 100 to get a Big Boss on a spider and a regular Boar Big 'Un than the RoR.
Message from the President. Moving up in the world eh? That's all for now.

> ...the media only covered it in the last two weeks of the election, so anyone who didn't leave it until the last minute and was proactive early on about researching the bill wouldn't have had access to that.\n\nNot true. Many Floridians knew of the true implications of Amendment 1 for months. Most just don't care about state politics until it gets to be a few weeks out from the general election. Plenty of information was known and reported regarding both of the solar amendments. We voted in favor for Amendment 4 back in August which provided tax exemptions for owning solar equipment.\n\nhttp://www.tampabay.com/opinion/editorials/editorial-one-good-one-bad-solar-amendment/2271572\n\nhttp://www.orlandosentinel.com/opinion/os-solar-amendment-beth-kassab-20160718-column.html
360 and PS3 imo. I grew up with Playstation and PS2, and generally I remember PS2 games being around $40 or $50, while many PC games would be $30 or $40 depending on production quality.\n\nAnother thing to mention, the first PC game I personally saw priced at $60 was Starcraft 2: WoL, released in 2010.
Archers generally might be tricky to pull off successfully against VC now with their new Raise Dead spell. One or two units of zombies can hold up your archers for quite a while. I've been toying around with using an Orc Arrer Boy with Rusty Arrers since the Orc Arrer Boys should do better against the Raise Dead fodder, but so far I'm not sure since you can also just leave a Big Un next to your archers to deal with summons.\n\nIt's all a matter of trade-offs, and VC definitely tend to have good targets for missile units. I'd personally prefer to spend the 1500 on trying to get another Giant. They're not as armored as an Arachnarok, but Giants seem to never route until they're basically dead, and the same can't be said of Arachnaroks.
From the Update 4 patch notes:\n\n> The Warriors of Chaos roster has been expanded. Aspiring Champions, Marauder Horsemasters, and Feral Manticores have been added.\nManticore mounts have also been added for all Chaos Sorcerer Heroes as part of this update.
| anti-biology rhetoric\n\nI'm not sure I understand what you mean by that. Are you getting at Marxism trying to overcome "survival of the fittest" or something? Fair enough if that's the case, but I've never used Darwinism to justify Libertarianism. It's not necessary, and it's too easy of a point to twist up and bring a whole argument down.
~~Bonus vs large applies only to damage dealt that gets reduced by armor and resistances. It does not contribute to melee attack or melee defense.~~\n\nBonus vs large/infantry and charge bonus apply to both melee attack and damage, with the charge bonus lasting for only a short time after a charge. I don't know for sure if the bonus vs large or other modifiers get added as AP damage, normal damage, or some ratio based on unit.
I'm pretty sure that silver weapons in Elder Scrolls do a lot more damage to ghosts, although it may not be listed in Skyrim (outside of some in-game book anyway). I'm not sure if it also does more damage to other undead.
Would tutorials and guides for assembly kits of previous games still apply to the TW:Warhammer assembly kit?
Civ starts and runs on whatever monitor is set as your main monitor (at least on Windows, idk other OSs). Just go into the display settings and switch monitors so that your secondary monitor is the main one. None of the other stuff you do should care about not being on the main monitor, and there's ways to duplicate your taskbar so it's not hidden.
By that logic, then regular employees are often pretty shitty. I hope that the non-shitty managers can get some sort of recourse whenever they happen to unfortunately hire a shitty employee.
I agree with you, and I called the vote switching idea silly. ~~I just don't really care.~~ EDIT: Actually I do care. Getting 5% of the popular vote mattered a lot more than preventing either Clinton or Trump.\n\nHis Clinton vote has ~~no effect~~ slightly slightly decreased my view of Penn Gillette. Still, he has been and will continue to be one of the biggest sources of spreading libertarian ideas to Americans who likely wouldn't hear about them otherwise (case in point: this West Wing video).
It makes no sense to force someone to turn up and submit a potentially blank ballot just so they don't have to be forced to pay money.
I wish I knew this before making three of them. For a while I was under the impression that they could only enter enemy territory during wartime. That'll make the religious victory more challenging, considering the religious spread is already incredibly vague.
Yes he did, although he justifies it by saying he got about a dozen people in solid blue states to vote for Johnson. I think the vote switching idea is silly since there's no accountability, but he was on Celebrity Apprentice and has a personal perspective of Trump, so it's fairly understandable.
Ninjahund is a streamer who plays a ton of multiplayer. Lately he's been saying his tier list is like:\n\nTier 1 - Empire, Vampire Counts, Greenskins\n\nTier 2 - Dwarves, Beastmen, Chaos, Wood Elves, Brettonia\n\nThe reasoning I think has to do with Empire, Vampire Counts and Greenskins all having a lot of flexibility and good lores of magic. Tier 2 factions are all still good, and I'd say the balance hasn't ever been closer for this game in multiplayer. There will be an update later on in February which will nerf flying units by keeping them on the ground longer when they land, and there will also be new Brettonian units added, so that may change things.
TL:DR\n\n* Melee Attack and melee defense are relative to each other. They are used to determine an attacker's chance to hit a defender. Minimum chance to hit is 10% and maximum chance to hit is 90%. If an attacking unit has same MA as a defending units MD, then there is a 40% chance to hit (aka that's the baseline).\n\nI've tried researching forums for this a lot, so here's the best summary I can give regarding how attacking works. I'm going to use Grimgor vs Franz for this example, and I'm also ignoring charging and the charge bonus for now.\n\n**Grimgor:**\n\nArmor - 110\n\nMA - 70\n\nMD - 35\n\nDamage - 160/290 (normal/AP)\n\n**Karl Franz:**\n\nArmor - 95\n\nMA - 65\n\nMD - 30\n\nDamage - 160/290 (normal/AP)\n\nThe formula for calculcating an attacker's percent chance to hit a defender is:\n\n% chance = 40 + (MA of attacker - MD of defender)\n\nThere is a minimum chance to hit of 10%, and a maximum chance to hit of 90%. With that being the case, the chance for Grimgor and Karl to hit is:\n\n% chance for Grimgor to hit = 40 + (70 - 30) = 80%\n\n% chance for Franz to hit = 40 + (65 - 35) = 70%\n\nSpells and abilities that raise or lower MA or MD will affect the chance that units land their attacks in combat. So if Franz receives +30 MD from a spell, then Grimgor's chance to hit becomes 50% instead of 80%. There are limits to how much you can improve the numbers, though. If Grimgor attacks Franz using Waaagh, which adds I think 53 MA, then Grimgor's chance to hit increases but caps at 90%, which is the maximum chance to hit. This means using Waaagh to help only Grimgor is a waste since his MA is already so high relative to everyone else's MD. Basically an attacker's MA is relative to a defender's MD.\n\nI'm not 100% sure that this is the formula for damage, but after some testing I'm almost certain it's close to this. It also gets kind of tricky to explain but an example should help it make more sense:\n\ndamage dealt = AP damage + (normal damage - (normal damage * (X / 100))) where X is a random number between half of the defender's armor value and the defender's full armor value\n\nIt looks messy, but basically the normal damage is reduced by a random percentage and is added to the AP damage, and then all of that is applied. Also, magic/fire/missile resistances apply to the total damage dealt after armor is factored in.\n\nLet's say Grimgor lands a hit on Franz. To calculate the damage we first need to know what Franz rolls for armor for this hit (the X in the equation). X can be anywhere from half of Franz' armor to his full armor, which means in this case it can be anything between 43 and 95 (idk how TW does rounding). Whatever number X ends up being is the percent that the normal damage is reduced by. This means that every attack against Franz will have its normal damage reduced by anywhere from 43% to 95%. We will say Franz got 75, meaning 75% of the normal damage will be reduced. This makes the damage calculation for this hit:\n\ndamage dealt = 290 + (160 - (160 * 0.75) = 290 + (160 - 120) = 290 + 40 = 330\n\nBasically, a more armored unit will on average reduce more normal damage per attack. However, the largest percentage of normal damage that can be blocked is 100% Despite having 110 armor, Grimgor can never block 110% of an attack. This may make it seem like going over 100 armor is not helpful, but it still definitely is. Let's say Franz lands a hit on Grimgor. Grimgor's armor is 110, so the minimum and maximum amount of damage that Grimgor can take is:\n\nmaximum damage taken = 290 + (160 - (160 * 0.55) = 290 + 72 = 360\n\nminimum damage taken = 290 + (160 - (160 * 1.00) = 290\n\nThe best armor roll that Franz can make is 95, meaning he can block at most 95% of damage. With Grimgor, however, there's multiple opportunities to roll over 100, meaning 100% of damage gets blocked. Basically on average, Grimgor can block 100% of the damage dealt roughly 18% of the time, since any armor roll between 100 and 110 counts as 100. For a unit with 120 armor like Dwarf Lords, they have a 33% chance to block all of the normal damage since they can roll anywhere between 60 and 120, and their minimum damage reduction is 60%. For a unit with 150 armor like Arachnarok Spiders (I think), they have a 66% chance to block all normal damage with a minimum reduction of 75% normal damage.\n\nCharging and charge bonus is a whole other thing which I can still try to explain, but it's definitely easier to ignore it for now to get a clear picture of how MA/MD and damage works.
You can choose any DLC background (assuming you own DLC) or the original blank one. I have all DLC and use King and Warlord background
Trump seems to have backed off on the anti-wind rhetoric. In last night's debate, one of the last questions was regarding energy policy and went like this:\n\nQUESTION: What steps will your energy policy take to meet our energy needs, while at the same time remaining environmentally friendly and minimizing job loss for fossil power plant workers?\n\nTRUMP: "Absolutely. I think it’s such a great question, because energy is under siege by the Obama administration. Under absolutely siege. The EPA, Environmental Protection Agency, is killing these energy companies. And foreign companies are now coming in buying our — buying so many of our different plants and then re-jiggering the plant so that they can take care of their oil.\n\nWe are killing — absolutely killing our energy business in this country. **Now, I’m all for alternative forms of energy, including wind, including solar, et cetera.** But we need much more than wind and solar."\n\nHe then went on to talk all about the need for more fossil fuels to make money. Is it a sincere opinion of his that he's really for wind? Probably not, but still it's what he said last night and is basically an afterthought for him compared to his focus on revitalizing fossil fuels.
I think there needs to be a difference between discussing cost-effectiveness in campaign vs multiplayer. A lot of high-end units can get a lot more bang for their buck against the AI, but other players won't fall as easily for the strengths of the same unit. Mostly this means that ranged units are more cost-effective in campaign than against other players.\n\nFor multiplayer cost-effectiveness, I'd say Goblin Wolf Riders might be the best. 300 for a fast, disposable unit that can take out almost any undefended missile infantry unit and provide helpful scouting is a great deal. Their worst-case scenario isn't awful since they're so cheap, and their best-case scenarios has wolf riders taking out artillery that is at least 3-4 times more expensive. I also think the Night Goblin Shaman deserves a mention, being able to bring Sneaky Stabbin'/Itchy Nuisance for around 400 (depends on the abilities you take). I think it's the cheapest wizard you can get in multiplayer, and Little Waaagh has useful stuff so spending 400 to be able to access it is well worth it.
Millennials supported Bernie largely because he best represented the biggest threat to the cronyism that Hillary basically symbolizes. Their dislike for Hillary obviously rose as the campaign went on, but it's not what drew them to Bernie in the first place.
Happily voted for Johnson in FL for the second time! If Democrats are leaving to the Libertarian candidate for President, maybe they should've rethought their presidential pick.
It's at least important to deal enough damage to get them to waver, then terror and fear would kick in again. I need to do testing to see how they fare against different cavalry units, but my main gripe is the complete lack of armor the savage units have (compared to 50 or 55 for Boar Big 'Uns). Even with the physical damage reduction savage units get, I think they get too hurt too quickly so that there isn't as much of an opportunity for them to deal damage.
That's a nice $1 bundle there. I've gotten some of these before in a "hacking" humble bundle (was looking into Python and it was mostly a Python bundle), and they're a good value, but I do think that the $15 bundle isn't worth it overall. Granted I haven't read any of them, but judging by the titles alone, I would certainly wager that one could find better, more focused material on whatever they're looking to learn for much less. I've also become skeptical of books written around doing a bunch of game projects, like the Lisp programming book.
Since you're talking about campaign judging by mentioning the training perk, why do you need a mount when you can vanguard deploy on top of the enemy? I think that ability of his coupled with his regen, which I think potentially surpasses the regen of all of the other lords, is enough to where a mount as well would make him completely better than all the others. Needs to have some tradeoffs.
https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/829836231802515457\n\nThe only thing that could make this more amusing would be to see Gorsuch also rule against Trump's ban from the SC.
That last bullet is pro-marijuana. It's a restriction on the DoJ's ability to interfere with a state's right to legalize medical marijuana.
FWIW this is just a blog post on Reason belonging to the writer of the Forbes article, so it's all one thing.
I believe the game tries to be balanced around the Large unit size, which is 75% of the number of units on the Ultra unit size setting. Also larger unit size settings increase the amount of health that individual units have, so that they also scale with unit size. However, spell damage does NOT scale with unit size. I don't know if this leads to differences in spell damage against units with multiple models on small or large size, but for spells that target individual units like Spirit Leech or missile spells, they are FAR more powerful on smaller unit settings and are very weak on ultra.\n\nQuick battle matches use the Large setting with a budget of 12,400 (I think).
They are free to do so. I think they're basically burning money using it for a likely fruitless recount, but it's not my money.
Agreed. It's barely been 24 hours since this call, and Trump isn't yet the leader of the US. Honestly I think the potential flipside of articles of Trump potentially blowing off a call from Taiwain would cause an angrier reaction from his critics than what's happened. By that, I mean whatever news networks have come out w/ about the Taiwan call seems like bitter backlash that would just be more bitter were he anti-Taiwan.
You're asking someone on Reddit to be non-partisan. Good luck. This article is all leftist propaganda and to the comment section will be the same.
Must be nice
| Again, there is no incarceration, just fines...\n\nMy thought is what happens if you choose not to pay those fines. It appears that for Australia, there is at least $20 fine for not voting (I think this is a federal fine, but other states have their own fines which seem higher overall). The follow-up for not paying that fine is below, as described on their site [here](http://www.aec.gov.au/faqs/voting_australia.htm).\n\n| If you do not either reply to the notice or pay the penalty by the due date, the matter may be referred to a court. There is a maximum fine of $180 (plus court costs) if the matter is dealt with by the court, and a criminal conviction may be recorded against your name.\n\nOn top of this, it seems that at least some of the states have rules in place so that failing to vote and pay the fine could lead to one's driver license being suspended (according to [Western Australia](https://www.elections.wa.gov.au/vote/failure-vote) and [NSW](http://www.elections.nsw.gov.au/voting/penalties_for_not_voting) ). All of this bureaucracy and fines just to force people to enter a voting booth is ridiculous.
I JUST finished watching this entire show, and it made me laugh out loud a lot more than most shows. Can't wait to go through Mitchell and Webb next!\n\nIf there's one thing I've learned from this show, it's to never bring a lover to the Quantocks.
Totally agreed. Ungor combat stats from the red line are nice to have since it's pretty much all one gets for quite some time, but getting early bonuses for the Upkeep/Recruitment reductions into Horde Growth is too good to pass up.\n\nI will say that for Beatmen grand campaign, I found myself putting all forces into one army and getting that army's lord the 3 Ungor combat bonuses. Meanwhile the second lord with an empty army* can invest fully into the blue tree to get horde growth as quickly as possible.
He's free to say what he wants or print what he wanted to in Breitbart, but I think his demeanor and rhetoric offers nothing but divisive drama which doesn't help the country at all. Bannon is a huge contributor to this fucking ongoing back-and-forth between right and left where one side gets outraged at the outrage of the other side, and so on, all while nothing gets addressed regarding the budget and military intervention and other issues.\n\nHe solves problems by creating new problems through the media so the initial problems get ignored. It's nothing new for Washington, but it seems to be his expertise and all he has to offer.
> I find it odd two former republican govs would get more support from the left over the right.\n\nIt's important to note that those Republican governors were elected in more left-leaning states. Aside from Reagan, MA has gone with every Democratic candidate since Kennedy onward in the electoral college, and Johnson was voted in during the time when NM had gone with Clinton and eventually Gore in the electoral college.\n\nMaybe it's just odd, or maybe it's reflective of how reasonable and rational Johnson and Weld appear.
This doesn't make sense and you need to remember the third choice. You're just eliminating Clinton voters that have Johnson as #2 from the equation. The numbers of voters in your first and second count is 21,200 but then it becomes 17,600 in the third count.\n\nAll of the people who voted for Clinton with Johnson as #2 would not lose their vote. Their #3 choice would be used and they would still be included in the election.
I always bring Boar Boy Big 'Uns if I bring any boar cavalry. For a difference of 150, they just seem a lot more effective against other cavalry and are the same if not slightly better against infantry. Lately though against Chaos and Dwarves, I've been trying bringing Boar Chariots with lots of infantry instead instead and I've had quite a bit of success.
Here is the study from the article: http://www.amjmed.com/article/S0002-9343(15)01030-X/fulltext\n\nThe main takeaways are that the US overall has a substantially higher homicide rate than the other 22 OECD countries included in the study, largely caused by a much higher gun homicide rate. I'm comfortable with how gun ownership laws currently function, and I think there's currently a reasonable balance between the rights of gun ownership (in FL anyway) and the background checks and restrictions currently in place.\n\nHowever, I do think it's naive to believe that gun violence throughout a country isn't proportional to the amount of gun ownership. This study states that the gun homicide rate in the US in 2010 was 3.6/100k. Is that homicide rate reasonably low enough to continue with our current gun laws? If the gun homicide rate increases, then at what rate does it become too much to accept where changes need to be made? Or is there no limit to how high of a homicide rate we can accept because gun ownership can't be questioned no matter how much guns have evolved since the 2nd amendment?\n\nBelow is the summarized result of the data from the study:\n\n> US homicide rates were 7.0 times higher than in other high-income countries, driven by a gun homicide rate that was 25.2 times higher. For 15- to 24-year-olds, the gun homicide rate in the United States was 49.0 times higher. Firearm-related suicide rates were 8.0 times higher in the United States, but the overall suicide rates were average. Unintentional firearm deaths were 6.2 times higher in the United States. The overall firearm death rate in the United States from all causes was 10.0 times higher. Ninety percent of women, 91% of children aged 0 to 14 years, 92% of youth aged 15 to 24 years, and 82% of all people killed by firearms were from the United States.\n\n
Grow up. If you promise something you deliver on it. These promotions as of late are very Carrier moves.
agreed.
This guy parties
It's hard to do that when you get called every *ist under the sun just for being a Republican or conservative. We tried being better and that didn't work so this is your fault. You made your bed now lay in it.
Do you honestly believe that people post in the same way that they post in the Donald on the rest of Reddit?
How did this get upvoted? Donald Trump is very much anti-alcohol. Stop swinging your political crap in here before it gets submitted to the moderators. 
You got a little something brown on your nose there. Actually come to think of it I see it on your lips as well.
Enjoy your ban
I heard the admins on Reddit are going to add that feature.

Oh fuck right off with the passive aggressive shit. If you're going to promote COOL FREE STUFF, then it should be COOL FREE STUFF, not shit tier coupons like John said multiple times it wouldn't be.
At least at that point your eyes would be as blind as the comments you make.
I would love to know how far downvoted these posts are
No one seems to be picking up on this in this thread. Everyone just automatically assumes that CNN tells the truth 100% of the time... This election should have taught them otherwise but I guess it doesn't meet their narrative
Liberal logic 
That's certainly what the piss-pants liberals would like.
Donald Trump proposed removing protections on the news media for making irresponsible stories and everyone shit on him for it. It's ironic now that Reddit is supporting a similar idea.
About that... 
Yet again you're missing the point. The point is you're dragging politics into somewhere that doesn't require it. Keep that crap to /r/politics. 
I love how to correct the record came in and down voted this into Oblivion
Hey man don't attach this to all Republicans. The majority of us don't like the guy either.
Can you provide some documentation as to how Trump "feels" about minorities? Preferably some without stretching out the rhetoric or using a absurd amount of hyperbole? I will wait. 
So you were saying we don't have a problem with terrorism from refugees, no? I'll wait for your excuse filled response while the victims of OSU are in the hospital. Scumbag.

(Side note - Whoever programmed the bot to auto-flair this post did an AWESOME job!)
Please go. The less liberals that we have here making everything so black and white the better everyone will be long term. When you said Trump-merica you lost 100% credibility. Can't even go into a Harry Potter subreddit without you people spilling your vitriol and hyperbole filled rhetoric against conservatives.  
So it is Fanatics all over again.

Nice work fucko
Did you allahu akbar to those too?
To play at devil's advocate for a moment, I would say that having those statistics is valuable for an employee perspective as well. Allow me to explain. When the budget is drawn up for a department it is typically based on the need for x amount of employees or work hours, calculated by current and historical usage data. Having the result of everyone's stuff working is great and all but if there is nothing to measure it by then you might find yourself at the short end of the stick being understaffed or worse, fired. Necessary evil. Skip a pointless ticket here and there, sure, but don't make it a habit.
Trump has already stated that the pre-existing condition protection of Obamacare will remain.

Jesus. 
We love the Jaguars though
In before down votes from brown nosers not remembering what John said about this promotion
Stop with the weak "xenophobic" rhetoric. Enforcing the law and keeping ILLEGAL LAW BREAKING ALIENS out of our country and keeping Potential RADICAL ISLAMIC TERRORISTS out until we can figure out how to best vet them is in our best interest for national security. Take the fucking liberal arts book out of your ass. 
GOT EM
From what I heard of another thread, there is talk of a new set of promotions coming soon and since the last one was Samsung this one might be apple
Just remember the millions of us little people that are trapped between Comcast and AT&T
That is a really poor fallacy that you are using. You are essentially using semantics to defend an emotion based statement that holds no water. There is a reason why that people don't like semantics. It derails the true meaning of a statement. You hide behind the semantics because you people got caught using hyperbole. Just admit it. You people think that all Trump supporters are racist. I'll even cut you a break. You think that 90% of trump supporters are racist old white people.  
How did that election taste
The problem is that John said it wasn't going to be coupons and now it is. John said that these were going to be awesome freebies and they are becoming less awesome after the pizza Fiasco.
Funny how all the leftist media sites seem to forget about that point.
I mean, what are they going to do, fire him? 
Why don't you go ask the folks at OSU how they feel about these refugees now

John said that these promotions would not be coupons and they are becoming coupons more and more every week. Do what you say you were going to do or don't do anything at all. Simple as that. Go fuck yourself.
"Forced..." Bernie endorsed Hillary. He sold out.

The argument was based on the lack of proof. If calling someone by their political label is an ad hominem attack then I guess the entire internet is guilty of it. Get a life.

So anyone that disagrees with you is uneducated? Glad those liberal schools are teaching such open-mindedness.
You're making a lot of assumptions that are false. You know nothing about me or what I support.
Lolno
Thanks a lot! Excited to upgrade but I'll wait if the new promos help any. Do you happen to know if we'd hear of anything soon outside of Monday's event? Or is it likely that new promos would be announced then along with whatever the new Uncarrier move is? 
Oy think I fixed it now mate. 
For group of people that tout themselves as being open-minded that statement is incredibly narrow.
Mods, /r/politics is leaking. 
A few of those could be interpreted as Isis influenced attacks. Another is misinterpreted retaliation for terrorism that unfortunately was targeted at the wrong party. And really, you are justifying the attack at OSU because he didn't kill anyone? Well I guess since they were only seriously injured it's okay, right? Fucking moron. 
You're right. I spun it that way in an attempt to avoid the liberal down vote police. As you can see that attempt was a failure

Is being anti-femenist that bad? Last feminists I had the pleasure of interacting with told me that not only should I neutered for being male but also killed for being gay because I am not participating in bringing more females into the world. Not to mention the overall anti-trans idealology of femenism.
As long as you also support commie punching(i mean they are responsiblr for deathsof over 200 million people, not to mention the systematic rape and cultural destruction of several nations), im game.

Individualism is the best argument agaisnt globalism, especially from an LGBT perspective. We frame ourselves on Individualism and being able to be seperate from others, globalism pushes a norm hard, reproduce, merge, combine, be the same. We dont want that.

Again, spoken like a true Cirrus operator.\n\nAll comes down to technique.  If your technique is good, propping a little 172 is no problem.  If your technique is faulty, well, propping a Cubbie or T-Crate will kill you just as fast.
Define "decent"... there aren't any that pay too well.  Flying skydivers and banners is the meat and potatoes of the sub-500 hour crowd.  Good news is you should only have to do a season or so of that kind of work before you're at minimums.
They're simple-minded creatures the size and weight of a small car.  Certainly not what I would consider 100% safe either.
The E170/E175 models in the 80-seat range are the smaller in the EJet family. They are powered with General Electric CF34-8E engines of 14,200 pounds thrust each. The E170 and E175 directly compete with the Bombardier CRJ-700 and Bombardier CRJ-900, respectively, and loosely compete with the turboprop Bombardier Q400. They also seek to replace the market segment occupied by earlier competing designs such as the BAe 146 and Fokker 70.\n\nThe Embraer 170 was the first version produced. The prototype 170-001, registration PP-XJE, was rolled out on 29 October 2001, with first flight 119 days later on 19 February 2002. The aircraft was displayed to the public in May 2002 at the Regional Airline Association convention. After a positive response from the airline community, Embraer launched the E175. First flight of the stretched E175 was on June 2003. The launch U.S. customer for the E170 was US Airways, after FAA certification, the aircraft entered into revenue service on April 4, 2004 operated by the MidAtlantic division of US Airways, Inc. The first E175 was delivered to Air Canada and entered service in July 2005. The 170-001 prototype performed its last flight on April 11, 2012. Its destiny was disassembly in the US for spare parts.\n\nFucking millennials.  It's a damn jet.  Thousands of people fly on that exact serial every year and survive without visiting an emergency room.  Get your free Coke and pretzels and lose a few more brain cells to your iPhone to pass the time.
Are flight schools the only operators that should fly safe aircraft?  Seals are cheap.  25 freedom bucks a side.  No excuse not to fix it.

...should not care about dumping *water* on the ground.  ;-)
Valid.  Text sucks.
Masterful?\n\nGood video though.
Granted.  But it really seems that regs and even airframe-specific rules get tightened due to systemic problems, not one-off idiots behaving irresponsibly.  But for the speed, this could have been a hotshot Boy Wonder pilot in a Cirrus.  He broke existing rules that every PPL has to rattle off on their check ride, so I cannot believe that a fleet-wide change is justified.  I wouldn't expect him to fly again though.
You spin me round right round right round...
Not really.  It's a really long exposure.  In the vicinity of departure and destination airports, airliners will fly according to prescribed procedures that basically consist of flying between points in the sky, but could stretch a hundred or more miles from the actual airport.  This looks like the beginning of an arrival procedure.
On any other sub, I'd say don't use Alexa.\n\nThis one... I couldn't tell you where to start.  Open source really has its limits when it comes to speech recognition.

I wouldn't go *that* far for an M-class.
Pretty much.  dropzone.com is a good place to start.  Or fire up your EFB of choice and look for their airspaces.\n\nThe smaller the better, in your case.  I see you have your HP already so you should be good to go in a C182 jumpship.
The rest of us would love to hear how *you* plan to pack for any meaningful amount of travel in your Lambo.
My girlfriend says my gifts feel better unwrapped.
Thus prompting the "customer" to seek another shop that will provide the "service" he is "paying for".\n\nYou're technically right though.
>perhaps precise is a better word\n\nNo, an ASI is accurate, not precise.  Precise would be the correct word if you had your airspeed down to the thousandth of a knot.  Precise, yes, but probably not accurate.\n\n>Makes me think that there is a mechanism that keeps it dead below a certain speed instead of it being an inability to detect any difference in ram pressure\n\nThere isn't.  You're just bad at reading comprehension.
Moment of inertia ought to be comparatively easy, if time-intensive... get the parts manual and model everything up.\n\nStability derivatives... can't help you there.  Test flying it might be your best bet.

Oh, it's a big, pretty white plane with red stripes, curtains in the windows, and wheels; why, it looks like a big Tylenol!
>**radio station license**\n\nFAR on that please!  You also left off registration (FAR 91.205(a)(2)).
Quaintly suggesting the person OP describes is sane...
Okay, but in first-world countries it's illegal.
You're probably not American, but this is found in one of our founding documents, the Declaration of Independence:\n\n>We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are **endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights**, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness. — That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed
"Club" type ownership is a great way to go.  Split all those fixed costs 3-4 ways and get a little free camaraderie to boot.\n\nI suggest hanging up flyers on any bulletin board you can find at the airport.  If there's a bathroom near the hangars that's a great place to look, actually.  Ask CFI's too, they interact with a lot of folks.
So synthetic marijuana is chemically made, ie "spice" and not natural, like Kush? Hmmmm where does Wax or Crumble fall into the spectrum?
Think of the flare as a process, not a single action.  Try to fly the plane at idle power a foot off the runway by applying successively greater aft stick.  No more ballooning for you.
Seriously.  What a clueless moron.
Nono, just the regressive public policy.\n\nPlease try not to be so racist in the future.  Makes you look pretty stupid!
Run that past me again after you sober up.
Correct.  I would not consider a 1500 pound creature that spooks easily, safe.  You probably have spent a lot more time around horses than I have, though.  So your assessment may be a little different.
For a VFR Cherokee?  $1000 in a good year, $20k in a bad year.  Good strategy is to budget $5k and stash the change for the bad year.
Yay, another way to waste your time that isn't looking at pictures of kittens on the internet.\n\nHonestly?  The kitten pics have a better return on investment.

*shrug* apparently.  People kept calling it "biannual", which would be twice a year.
If you have the money to build that, feel free to call up the boneyard and make some offers.\n\nOh, and do post pics.

Feel the Johnson (bar).
He golfed, yes.  But not until [four months](http://www.politico.com/story/2017/02/trump-first-visit-golf-course-234729) into his presidency.\n\nI am not saying people don't deserve a little vacation every now and again.  But every weekend is wildly inappropriate.
>This person needs a BFR and to get failed\n\nYou can't fail a BFR for two reasons: 1) it's not a pass/fail, 2) it's not even called that anymore.\n\nBut they do need a come to Jesus talk.  And some come to Jesus dual.
Yes.

If the regs got tightened every time a lone moron bent them, we would all be grounded by now.  I would not worry.

Maybe it's just wishful thinking on my part.

Knowledge of other person is not really required if you are using chocks or a tail tie down.  See previous remarks vis a vis technique.  Yours could get you killed.\n\nI don't think anyone "prefers" to hand prop.  If my starter is broken at my home field, where my mechanic is a short phone call away, I agree: no reason to prop it just to go flying.  If it's a trip, I'll drive it.  Fine by me.\n\nStill, I maintain it's a good tool to have practiced if you plan on being around single engine piston aircraft for a while.  Your starter shits the bed on a fuel stop at Nowheresville, Bumfuckistan, are you really going to wait for a mechanic to drive all the way out to you, to perform a task that takes one part and maybe an hour of shop time?\n\nParenthetically, yes, it does have everything to do with learning in a Cirrus.  When you have available the kind of service apparatus typical of a Cirrus training environment, you refuse airplane A, fly airplane B, and when you see airplane A again, it's fixed.  No personal involvement required.  Only rarely do you land away from a place where your service department can reach.  Just like the airlines, where many of those folks eventually go.\n\nSo at the end of the day, good, you are self aware enough to know you probably aren't the right person to hand prop.  I would not let that dissuade you from accepting assistance from "some poor schmuck" who actually knows how to do it safely, though.
TBO is a recommendation, not a requirement.  OP is not a Part 135 operator.\n\nThere is no way to tell how many hours until an overhaul.  Very few owners end up overhauling exactly at TBO.  It's a waste of money if you're *at* TBO and not making metal and have good compression.  And it's foolish to run a low-time engine that's spent 20 years abandoned on a ramp in North Dakota to TBO.\n\nThus my skepticism at the supernatural knowledge OP claims to have!
SR-10: only half as good as SR-20, very poor imitation of SR-71.
Interesting way to look at it.\n\nSo your position is essentially that you could log your taxi time if you actually end up going flying, but you couldn't log your taxi time if you find an issue on the runup pad and end up taxiing back?  That does seem to be the letter of the reg... food for thought.
Same in the US.
Yes there are.\n\nShould adjust with the screen backlight.
Yep.  That'll keep out those non-aircraft-owning lower-class riffraff!
>quite a drive\n\nGoogle gives me an hour for that drive.  In the Midwest, we call that "going for groceries"!
Depends on how IFR you want to go.  Price a GPS database subscription lately?
> 1500 hours until a major overhaul\n\nHow do you know?!
Here we see the wild 737 reaching its spawning ground.  Once they have laid their eggs (known as "Cessnas") they will swim downstream to receive their paint and wings.
For what, though?  From a second read through, I don't know that he really busted any FAR's.  There's plenty of room to be scary as shit and still legal.

Doesn't seem like the kind of person to bother with things like flight reviews, does he...
Looks like the bottom left of the FO's 8-pack is a CDI with glide slope. The captain would have at least one more.  A CDI tells you how far off your selected radial you are (in degrees).  They probably have DME (distance measure equipment), so with some trivial math you can figure out how far off course you are in miles.\n\nPaper charts tell you what frequencies and radials to tune, and how far to take them.  It is not hard once you get your head around it.
In this fantasy land (where you can also start a tail number with a zero), I'd buy a trainer-type aircraft and do a leaseback.\n\nTail number: N00B.
That's a secondary role though.  It was developed as a trainer.\n\nI mean, by that logic a [Thrush](http://www.iomax.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/plane_exterior_2015-03-24.jpg) and a [Caravan](https://i2.wp.com/fightersweep.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/AC208B-Cessna-Caravan-AGM114-shot.jpg?ssl=1) can be called light attack airplanes.  Ridiculous, no?
You don't have the money to store it, you don't have the money to fly it.  No big deal.  So you take off the wings and put the whole thing in your garage, right?\n\nThis was just an ego trip.  With a C152, of all things.
Never seen a language that uses "==" to test equality and "=" to assign, huh?
ಠ‿ಠ
Very confusing.  Was it a fighter jet, as the headline claims, or an L-39, as the article claims?  Poor journalism.
Right?\n\n"At this very moment, in a neighborhood near you, there are hungry pilots that need airplanes.  Make a difference, donate yours today!"
Good writeup.  Thanks.
If it makes you feel better, if you fly enough, the ability to file Direct will probably even out the cost of subscription.\n\nedit: Oh, you're out on the east coast.  Disregard!
I think the recent survey someone posted showed only 1/3 of us are airplane owners.  For a one-size-fits-all solution, I'd make the change on your pre-taxi checklist.  I think it's on most of them anyway.
Double-dog dare you to.\n\n(and take your electoral votes with you ;-))
That exact phrase, no.  A phrase one synonym different, yes.  FAR 1.1:\n\n>Flight time means:  \n(1) Pilot time that commences when an aircraft moves under its own power **for the purpose of flight** and ends when the aircraft comes to rest after landing; or [...]
> dumb enough to hand prop it\n\nSpoken like a true Cirrus operator.
Ok. I feel like I'm setting myself up here, but is there a thing called separation of church and state? I feel like I'm really stupid right now, and maybe I should read about it instead of asking on reddit. Am I just an ass and my thinking is way off?
They don't need 4 to do that.
Nice, and huge gym. At first i thought it was just cardio machines, a cage, & that's it. But they had 2 whole other areas. There is a UFC gym right down the road from me, and i never once have been. So are these not MMA gyms, with legit coaches teaching you mma? 
Yes it sure did. Well I stopped by the comic store and bought the PHB for 5e. I am excited! They have a D&D league ever wed. Starting at 7. Plus every Sunday they have a Pathfinder league. The guy who helped me was very knowledgeable and helped me out. He also brought up Volvo Monster guide that covers even more hybrid classes. Like a lizard man. I didn't want to drop a hundy on just 2 books so I got the PHB for now. And I think I may just go up there and experience my first ever D&D experience. 
I am very curious as to how Libertarians feel a out this, in regards to libertarianism. Leaving "morality" out of the discussion. I am a libertarian myself, juts not well versed in how this directly relates to it. Except that the president should not have this power, I believe.

Another stateist, nationalist propaganda, pro military movie to tell us about how great our country is & how the military can do no wrong. Uhhh no thank you. Filed into the "full of bullshit" category along with other greats, like American Sniper.
Am i disputing that? No, so i dont get what you are trying to say.
Ya, i hear what you are saying, but I just have to disagree. People do care about others, and they do care about them selves. People still speed even though they know they will get a ticket for it. So the idea of them stopping a text b/c of some fee seems very doubtful to work. Maybe it would, if the fine was some amount that would just take a way an average pay check. But do we really want to fine people that much just so it would work? I for sure don't. We already have laws in place for your example of BEFORE, its called murder. It's not as if a person gets in a wreck, a person dies, and nothing happens. They have to pay the bills, the fees, charged with murder in an extreme case. The laws are there already, i don't think more is the answer.
Bliss finisher is a ddt? This time and age? Hmmmmmm not sure i like that.
From what I have read about Gorsuch, this is a rather good choice. He is very skeptical on executive power, prefers state power to federal, strong view on  the 4th Amendment limiting the government's power to intrude on privacy. I actually don't object to this decision at all. Solid choice honestly, not sure what all the hoopla is all about.
Ah ok, that helps clear things up. So what happens when someone points to a regulation that has done more harm than good, or hasnt done any good at all? Is there just not any that do that so they dont have to worry those instances? 
I hate that Bailey won already. And to what, just lose it at Fast Lane, and have Charlotte be 6 time champion. There is a lot of praise going around here about womans wrestling, and it needs to stop. This is just absolute shit and is making them look like a joke.
Too late. I already committed. Maybe im jaded? Maybe i expect quality? But ya, this stuff is why i stopped watching for 4 years straight and If AJ wasn't around with Nakamura waiting in the wings i'd stop again.
But how do I get something that has them all? What's that called? If the PHB only has 3 put of 12, im afraid it may be overwhelming if I need to buy 4-5 different books just to read about the different classes, much less the races and combinations. I do love reading the lore of it though. 
Really enjoyed the movie. Did not for q second even think about KKC. I still don't see a good reference after it being brought up. I think if you enjoy good movies, then you should watch it.

I agree. Not sure how much it swayed some of my more casual friends. But We had a group of 8 people watching it & EVERYONE "felt" Kovalev won, since we didnt actually score round by round. Kind of felt like a robbery to me, not sure why either. Cause clearly Ward was running away with it. I think the damage is what made it feel like Kovalev had won. It was just incredibly one sided...although those body shots were brutal from Ward. There can only be one thing to do now...rematch! or maybe Ward will move up to Heavy and fight Deontay Wilder!
Ok. Good reply. So I guess my question would be then, what should be the Libertarians party stance if they adhered to libertarianism on the issue? My assumotion is It would have to be against it based on one of the main philosophy of libertarianism is individual freedom and that nobody should be denied their pursuit of happiness as long as it doesn't harm others. In which case doesn't matter if they are a citizen or not. This is for anyone. Would i be correct in this thinking? 
If i was salty about something, sure. But since im not, kinda doesnt make sense.
Young Kvothe? About what I envisioned \nOlder Kvothe? Not even close to what I envisioned. I always saw bar owner Kvothe as a beardless, cleaned up version of Tormund Giantsbane.
Is Shaman not a playable class? If no, has it ever been?
Haha genuine laugh here. Have a great commit genocide on the American Indiams errrrrrrrr Thanksgiving today. 
I too am curious how others imagined this scene but didn't imagine it like this. This is pretty much exactly how I envisioned it. Sitting on top of a Stonehenge like structure while a giant salamander/dragon like creature approached. 
Ummmmm i guess i am? I am looking for reasoning that is reasonable . If not from them, then hopefully from someone here who could give clearer context.
No need to switch. I honestly have my doubts about global warming and I dont trust the gov in any capacity to do solve any issues. I absolutely disagree with the idea that we need gov to combat global warming. And I'm not impressed at all by you driving a "fuel efficient" vehicle when you can go electric. The solar panels are impressive & if you can afford those then not sure why you wouldn't drive a tesla. And well the average person can EASILY grow their own vegetables and make their own compost. Far easier and cheaper than installing solar panels and actually does a lot more for the environment you so claim to so care about.
How many spots have been left open? 
Damn that's generic.
So which school do you like more?
What's a down door?
I heard a lot of cheering actually.
How is this beneficial to the top fighters? They aren't gaining anything by more money going to lesser known fighters. If anything this probably hurts them. I see what you & /u/Xmaspast are asking for, but there has to be value in it for these top fighters to want to form a Union. And nobody really has come up with anything. All i keep hearing is "form a union" but with no actual sound reasoning for the top fighters to do this. And if they did, what do you think will happen? Id still wager the UFC would just find other elite fighters, like a Michael Venom Page & bring them in.
I think making $8million a year guaranteed for 5 years qualifies as setting himself up for life. 
Seen people post a bit about this movie. Sat down to watch it...lasted 30 minutes.  Oh look, more post, maybe I wasn't in the right state of mind.  Sit down and basically force myself to watch to finish the movie.  I know people have different opinions and my opinion s that this movie is absolute shit. And I'm actually surprised anyone could consider this movie as a top comedy. It's not on the level of Dumb and Dumber, Tropic Thunder, There's Something about Mary, Superbad,  40 year old Virginia. It just isn't, im sorry.  Even with different opinions and feelings about a movie you have to still be able to recognize quality. I just can't fathom how this movie holds up to one's that I stated, which most common sidereal top comedies even if it wasnt there flavor of tea.
That's nothing how I envisioned her at all. I like my vision much more. 
Do you really not know that a phone number has nothing to do with messages on twitter?
Oh, well thank you. I had no idea this was a thing. I'm shocked so many people are being rude about it so I appreciate this.
It isn't. It's just a bunch of "patriotic" blow hards making an ordeal out of nothing. Because they have some brainwashed fetish about "nationalism" and being "patriotic" like America is fucking special or something and we have to respect her and our troops for all the "freedom" they give us.
Same rule here in Houston. NO, not the same rule. It is just odd to me that 2am seems like the national cut off. Why? I have no idea whatsoever. Kind of mind boggling. And then with just the sing of a paper, the mayor allows bars to be open till 2:30. Seems like it should be left up to the owner of the establishment. 
Very nice! Good hard ass sparring there, with good technique, the leg kicks ending the combos looked brutal. Who the fuck is Mike? lol
I assume you didn't answer the question because you honestly don't know. Or maybe it doesn't fit your narrative. But since you won't answer it, I will. Kelly Brook & he was champ at Welterweight, which is 148lbs. Good job at ignoring his question though because it shuts down your argument completely.
Goldberg. I think both Taker and Goldberg get inducted in New Orleans.
What's a fighters union going to do that the fighters themselves can't already do? If the union holds out, would you like to  guess what will happen? The UFC will just use fighters not in the union.
Just in time for FFXV!
No replay? Wow, thanks for that huge pile of shit. 
Quality. 
Could i be enlightened on what an "art" film entails? 
Florida State won't be going up by 7. With 8 defenders in the box all 60 minutes, you guys are going to be shut down.
Oh come on now. Nothing idiotic about what I'm saying. Don't act like your offense is this great anomaly. It isn't. And let's not pretend Michigan doesn't have one of the better defenses in the nation. 
I cant tell if you guys are serious or not. What was the harm?
Why are the people over at r/politics having absolute shit storm over this? I read maybe 1 comment in a positive light about this. What is the fear about not having so many regulations such a negative concept to the vast majority of people?
Honest question, are you one of the many hypocrits that preach about global warming but don't actually do anything themselves about it? Instead just want gov  to pass stricter regulations and laws? 
If Phillips is just the "host" then why does he sit at the announce table? 
My favorite fighter of all time, Kostya Tszyu. 
Because it is a UFC PR machine. To some people, like myself, that is enough alone to make me never want to listen to another episode. Others, like yourself, don't mind it. Most things that have a hidden agenda tend to be pretty "gross" in my book. This being one of them.
When you say stacked, what do you mean? Cause i see 1 good fighter in that group and she fights at 115. Please explain.
Why can't bars stay open till 2:30 already?
Nope, not even Ali.
See you're one of those girls that like romance. Lost it hahahahahaahaha First time to see this glorious promo.
This entire match was lame. From the beginning to not having the cell down,even though all the previous matches it was, to the weak ass ending that had Sasha lose in her hometown. That match sucked. 
I was in New Orleans this past weekend and on Saturday there was a womans march. I am a male, and I joined them along with my best friend. Neither of us had any clue it was planned or going to happen and just happened across it. Everyone was really nice too. One thing i thought was curious, no black woman at all. 
My understanding is that Holloway wins the title once Pettis couldnt make weight. This is now confusing me. He could still lose the fight, but he wont the interim because Pettis failed to make weight. What am i missing here?
A fighter at 135. Can she make 125? Probably. But then we are getting into all these 115ers and 135ers switching weights. And /r/clbranche I cant even comment cause you are hyping up WMMA that it's leaving you blind to their actual skill levels. Lets just pump the breaks and see wmma for what it is. Vastly unskilled competitors with legit competitors scattered far and in few between. Opening another division is just going to water it down even more.
Kind of looking for legitimate reasoning, not just "they dont like him regardless" Cause that isn't legitimate reasoning. 
I understand morality in libertarianism. Bad wording I suppose, I meant more in aspects of the law and constitution and if this over steps the boundaries of gov. In a libertarian view. I understand that Republican view of law for the most part is ok with this while dems don't believe this as something lawful. Even though both party's have granted the president the power to do so. Also you said that you oppose the idea of restricting people's movement who are peaceful. I think that was the word. But "peaceful" is objective and some may see them as peaceful while others don't. Which seems to be clearly what is happening with the dems and Republicans. That's what I meant as leaving out "morality" Hope this expands on what I was trying to say.
Fedor doesnt have to fight for the belt.
Just people like you who think cheating and breaking a rule are the same. 
I overhyped  the shit out of this game, & i still love it.
Damn she is so sexy.
Not being over turned by Gorsuch. I'm not sure what you are you trying to say, sorry.
Clearly must be global warming. I mean over the past 100 years the temp in November has fluctuated anywhere from a brutal 0 degree change ALL THE WAY UP to a 3.4 degree change! My god this global warming thing must be stopped b/c 500 years from now it might actually reach 100 degrees for 1 day in November. -rolls eyes- This is clearly b/c of man & not b/c of naturally occuring hot/cold cycles the earth has. Then again I don't study this so I'm sure the scientist who blacklist and ruin the careers of anyone with credentials who disagrees are to be trusted.
The single most racist commercial I have seen. I am still shocked it was aired. But as long as you aren't racist towards Americans, then its ok. I know that commercial for sure guaranteed me that I will never buy anything from GF.
I sure wish Dolph would go down to NXT. Cause he is just hot garbage on the main roster.
Do we really need more laws to tell people how they should drive based on the concept of "its safer". At least not with actual evidence that the number of incidents is reduced enough to warrant ticketing individuals and fining them. Once this becomes law, it isn't going away, rather or not it actually does what it is intended to do. Ultimately it is up to you, to drive in a manner not to harm others, and if you don't then you are held accountable. 
I must not understand how this salty business work then. Oh well, fuck it. Hopefully Ronda gets knocked back into retirement.
But no Shaman. Let sigh. There are so many classes too I feel so overwhelmed. I love reading about them so maybe I'll stop by the comic store and pick up a book that covers the races and classes ? That is the PHB, correct?
Not at all. It just means i don't like her at all and hope she gets ktfo lol. Salty would be if she beat one of my fav opponents and I wanted whoever she fought next to KO her, because of her previous fight(beating the fighter i do like). That isnt the case. It's definitely ill will though, just not the salty kind. I think shes a cunt, & just want to see her get blasted. 
I would like to know why the ref did not walk to the other side of the choke to have a better view of the actual choke. 
Arrogance won't, but my utter disbelief in the team will. I, along with many other fans have given up on Michigan until they can actually beat Ohio. 
Top 15 at best. Jericho has some really bad matches that are just duds especially when compared to the Brets, HBK's, Austin, Rock, etc. He has one good feud, with HBK, in a time when wrestling was super down. You have to look at the whole picture and he just fails to really impress. 
Then what is the point of having the belt if Pettis can't win it?
I always got it, from the very beginning i got it. Doesn't mean his point isnt valid though. Doesn't mean your point isnt bad either. I just liked that he was able to kinda shut down your original argument with 1 perfect example. Maybe GGG could meet Ward at Super Middle for a mega fight? 
Ok. I am new to the D&D world, and getting interested. We have a good local comic book shop that has a D&D league they host weekly that I have been tempted to check out. 
Nobody should be ok with the ending to that rumble. Replays have always been a thing in rumbles. Always. To just let wwe slide on this huge botch is utter bs. AJ clearly hit first, just roll with it. Don't treat your fans like clowns, it's a smack in the face. Crap like this really makes it hard to stay a fan. 
So what's going to happen to Joe Mixon when the video is released?
Probably referring to civil rights laws on discrimination, which would be a private property issue. I like the choice, for good reason i believe so we will just have to agree to disagree then.  
Blatant cheating? Hitting someone after the bell isn't cheating, it's breaking a rule. Just like a low blow or fence grabbing. She wasn't greased up or lacing her gloves with some type of chemicals. Too many people in this thread saying she cheated when it isnt. Oh, and yay! Another woman's division the UFC doesn't need. Hope everyone's happy. 
You definitely misinterpreted my statement. I think it's gross b/c they are extremely bias, not because they dont shit on the UFC. You are implying i dont like it because they dont bash the UFC, which isnt true. It's the bias towards the UFC that i dont like. Bashing has nothing to do with it.
What a shitty game to lose. At home, for the division,  3 cb's injured,  and the Lions defense can't make a stop. This season feels like a wash. Yay, made the playoffs to just get blown out on the road to Seattle.  Id be much happier with a division title and a loss at home. Guess Lions will just let Rodgers shit on them forever. This feels exactly like Michigan/Ohio right now.  Sick to my stomach.

I saw it, I remember all my former friends being so opposed to the Iraq war and our overall involvement in the problems of the middle east, then Obama became president and silence. I was still pissed at all the continued policies. But overall the left disintegrated.

I have a complete disdain for the media and main stream democrats with their manufactured outrage.

You think a SEAL team is just going to let people move about freely? That whole area was probably on lock down while the SEAL team did their thing looking for data and such. Depending on how bad her wound was applying pressure may not have cut it. Also the fact that a SEAL team member died ain't no way anyone was coming or going for a good couple hours most likely.

God, I remember as a child being taken by my father-in-law to a bull fight in Tijuana. You can imagine how that went.\n\nHe was a disgusting man, and was attracted to disgusting events.
It evidently went to shit. One of them died, which means there was an active fight going on even with the drone strike before or during. Then they searched the area looking for documents/computers/data. One of them dies which means medical aid had to be rendered. I'm betting it took a lot longer then they intended.

I don't like Trump so far but I if the left wants me to actually oppose him like they do they need to be better than him. They keep pushing bullshit like this where they take him saying one thing claim he claimed something else and then say look he lied.\n\nThey are proving themselves to be just as bad if not worse because of the hypocrisy. 
You do know that coca cola is a leader in  distributing medications in remote locations? \n\n
It's actually low overhead as a percentage but higher per patient in absolute dollars.
No he didn't. He used the last released figures which don't include 2016 because they haven't been released.\n\nThere was an increase in the last year on record and he exaggerated that significance.\n\nThat is not a lie that is not fake news that is just standard politics.\n\nI'm sick and tired of propaganda against trump. Articles like this where they use unofficial numbers and then clam he lied empower trump top get away with real lies.\n\nStop sharing bullshit propaganda suck him on actual issues and facts. Don't lie to try and make him look worse it makes him look better.
When my generation complains that they don't have pensions I tell them they have part of pensions just like their parents.\n\nThe only problem is that the last generation got top get paid by pensions and the children have to fund them.

Banks don't grade investments.\n\nThe government both required ratings to sell on the secondary market and only a few ratings agencies are allowed to grade investments.\n\nSo banks told the ratings agencies to grade to AAA or well go to your competitors.\n\nThe government was all for it up until the crash because it meant a ton of people got into homes.
Yes when it's most convenient to them they will.
Regulation especially regulation to promote housing was one of the primary pillars of liberal beliefs for 30-40 years until their unfuckingbelievable amount of increase regulation and subsidies was at the heart of the crash not deregulation which never actually happened.
When you confuse wealth and income you make yourself look stupid.
The budget that had been floating around was apparently close to the heritage foundations plan which cut about 10t over a decade.\n\nWho knows what will actually happen.
If that's the case Trump might have adequate reason to declare martial law. If citizens get murdered in riots and local law enforcement is told not to help  It gives him everything he wants.
No its not this law is the one where if you ask for help to navigate irs and ss billing and payments you lose a constitutional right.\n\nLiberals pushing this kind of bullshit push rational people to trump. 
Trump and pence to get to Paul Ryan.
They started out partisan. They often would use either percentage or absolute numbers whichever one was showing what the fact checker wanted.
Awesome good to have at least one market to show all hell doesn't break loose. \n\nI knew it was being debated in a few states but I hadn't seen it was passed. That makes me happy thanks.
Yet there is no actual evidence being released. I hope there is some and he gets impeached but too much like the rash of fake hate crimes and other shit that makes me doubt.\n\nThe Steele Dossier was floating around since June and not a single piece has a single piece of evidence. It's all circumstantial. 
He can appoint multiple supreme court justices and he can easily claim that they were working with ISIS.\n\nIf they can do it to one person they can do it to another. 
Cap and trade is not tax and rebate. Cap and trade often has massive overhead and leads to scams which is why I personally don't like it.\n\nTax and rebate especially with a border adjustment is a really simple system harder to exploit and leaving the us doesn't protect you from it like it dis with cap and trade.
CNN  shot them selves I the got multiple times this election cycle.\n\nThey had a moderator with an agenda against trump. Even if you don't like him a hostile moderator isn't good. \n\nThey had people feed control questions\n\nThey interviewed their own cameraman showing the scary trump won.\n\nThey declared loudly and proudly to everyone that they were pro Clinton and willing to break rules to help get.\n\nIn the end this only made people distrust them more.
Yeah if you design crazy as asking for help with taxes and social security.\n\nThat's literally what this law was. If you asked for legal help with taxes and social security you lose a constitutional right.
They aren't that is bull. They are using percentage instead of absolute dollar increase and they put the first year massive increases that happened on the pre aca side even though it went up a huge amount in 2009 because the aca passed.\n\nIt's how to low with statistics 101.
The biggest thing would be teaching people math and statistics so that they can see that it doesn't exist.\n\nIt's choices that make the difference. Women and men make different choices which lead top the difference.\n\nThe next would be educating children about the effects those choices will have so people can make educated choices about their future.
Because hes afraid that Russia and Trump will be too friendly. These action force Trump to either do a 180 and remove the escalations and admit hes going to be with Russia. \n\nIts to make it hard on Trump to not follow the same choices as Obama wanted. 
I don't know about that. The republicans just witnessed and inflicted a hard line opposition against the democrats. They are now voting overwhelmingly with Trump so far. \n\nI believe that they are simply going to vote within the republican ranks and then allow those in the weakest states to vote against him on key issues as long as things pass.\n\nThis allows them to simply ignore democrats entirely and lead with a republican agenda decided only by republicans. 
But his import tax bullshit can cause a massive issue.\n\nMany people are hoping hes just posturing on that stuff for better trade deals but it would be a massive problem for a lot of companies.
We can only hope so. Might get the wet dream of both sides losing.
I haven't been to a doctor in 2 years I just stay sick now.  In the two years before I went to the doctor 3-4 times a random test wouldn't be covered and it would cost me $500.\n\nDidn't happen before happened repeatedly after. 
It costs 100 million to build a pipeline and expected return is 200 million at current prices you spend 95 million building it.\n\nAt this point oil drops and the expected value is 50 million down from 200.\n\nIt costs you 5 million to complete a project that will earn 45 million net profit to complete or a loss of 55 million total.\n\nIf you stop you just lose 95 million.\n\nThese are random numbers but show how they would want to complete a project.
Sayings its ok to punch a group that is known for fierce protection of self defense and the 2nd is the sure sign of a moron.
I do know that my wife went through the entire process. It's very easy. \n\nThere are two basic types of hormonal drugs. They try one then the other if there are issues.  It's something a pharmacist is easily capable of administrating. \n\nIn fact in many countries they successfully do.
So if your mom never paid bills like many older woman and their children take care of them they should lose a constitutional right with zero oversight.\n\nNext up posting things critical of the trump regimen is a sign of mental illness and they will take your first amendment away.
Honest people don't include undecided in either camp because undecided isn't taking a stance.
Because elephants are the biggest land mammal known to the majority of people.
Yeah I hope so but some people currently on government assistance might lose out. Who knows how many or how bad or what.
And all evidence shows that after the great society push the middle class stopped getting any benefits from increasing productivity, Small business creation started going down, blacks stopped catching up to whites in wealth.\n\nAll the data shows that passing for the safety net kills the middle class and keeps people in a poverty trap.
And vouchers would fix that problem. 
Any fact check that doesn't say true on this is revealing that they are partisan.\n\nReport should be he accurately cited statistics but cherry picked the time frame to make a point. Same way all politicians do. \n\nBy calling a truth even a cherry picked one a lie theses "fact check" cites show they are partisan shills and should be ignored.
Bernie in the debate was scary. He had no idea what was going on. I saw him wind up a massive haymaker on the woman that owned 5 hair salons and wiff when she said she herself could no longer afford  her own insurance.\n\nHe kinda embarrassed himself.
It's because your getting pressure from the middle who look at the behavior of the left and the left declaring your with us or we will use violence is forcing people to trump.\n\nIf you say someone is evil that's ok but if you are evil yourself I won't join you. I don't like trump but looking at the lies and violence on the left it makes me pick between two evils.\n\nI want to join the left but they are actively forcing me away by supporting domestic terrorism.
I think this woman is a hero but she shouldn't have said how she spotted him. Should have said something else so the other trafficer scum could get caught from the same mistake.
This is the thing that gets me. Putin can leak or say whatever he wants about Trump and the Media will take it and run with it. He has basically direct control over our news media. It wouldn't surprise me to find out the entire buzzfeed document was Putin feeding stories to weaken Trump. \n\nBut Trump may also be completely and totally corrupted but the lack of hard evidence and the fact that so many news outlets just run stories now without any fact checking makes me feel like I have to give the orange turd the benefit of the doubt all too often. 
Ron had said that his son only differs in a few things. Rand prioritizes his votes and only fights when he thinks he will win or lose but make a point without burning bridges.
He used the most recent available FBI statistics in this case which is a lie why?
Don't refer top them as riot our protest refer to them as domestic terrorists it is the most accurate way to describe them.
And what happened to the average black family wealth before and after the great society push?
Thank fucking god. I was pissed at liberals for not hammering this issue harder and talking about crowd sizes and other bullshit. 
Ok I don't like what trump is doing is stupid it's a waste of resources and his bar is too low for someone who I'd a threat.\n\nBut identify theft doesn't take a trip to the IRS office to clear up. It can take years cost you a job, a house or anything else that a background check is required.\n\nIt's horrible to go thought. This woman was put in a hard place and I want a path to citizenship that allows anyone who wants to come and live and be in America to come here.\n\nBut she made a choice when put in a hard place that can destroy someone who is an actual citizen.  It's unfortunate there wasn't a valid choice for her to be legal but choices have consequences.
Support of teachers unions should be classified as a religion and they are already stealing your money.
\nAnd liberals could fund planned parenthood but they believe the government should do it.\n\nBoth sides do things the other hate and think it's fine.
Warner Brothers has the best way to deal with these things. Attempting to white wash history instead of explaining things is a bad decision IMO. \n\nhttps://ethicsalarms.files.wordpress.com/2015/08/warner-brothers-warning.jpg
Trump beat Hilary 2 to 1 military vote. You are deluded to think liberal states would win.
Yes but that drives the cost up significantly. Most people don't care if their birth control pill costs $200 a month exactly because its covered by insurance. \n\nBirth control pills were created in the 70s and are very easy to mass produce cheaply and would be if it were allowed to be sold OTC. They could easily be made for cents a piece as they are in many parts of the world already. 
 Cheap generic birth control could easily be sold otc with no added cost. It would be nearly as cheap as aspirin.\n\nPeople could easily then donate to planned parenthood to fund those that really couldn't afford it.
I showed you two ways trump could easily get 4% gdp and your breakdown doesn't even mention repeal of regulations which is a massive part of conservative economics and a massive part of trump and the republican plans.\n\nSo yes it's not non partisan site.
The Clinton email dumps revealed that the strategy was to promote trump and Cruz because they were extreme/crazy.\n\nThen voters would have to vote Clinton to avoid trump. Didn't work out that way.\n
But I thought Japan had finally embraced Keynesian economics and they were going to do so well. Krugman save them.
They don't want ANY new regulations. That's the point. They want to shrink government. They want the EPA to be powerless.
Bullshit. Pure and simple. They are looking at to rates and not effective rates which means it's bullshit.
BLM has acted like a terrorist organization multiple times and on those occasions them getting shot would be acceptable.\n\nIn the current climate every sow thinks the worst of each side represents the entire other side is easy to see why people would give their side the benefit of the doubt.\n\nThe same way people believed all the fake hate crimes that have populated the news recently.\n\nNo one stops and thinks anymore. At least not those that are taking up the news cycle right now.
They are forbidden from owning our purchasing a gun and the government was supposed to confiscate any guns they did own.\n\nThis is not a fight liberals should be making. It divides them from the middle. Liberals can no oppose trump they need to fight the battles the middle will join them in otherwise the coasts will protest and be unable to resist him because the coasts don't have enough power.
This is one of the best things republicans are currently doing for the country. Almost every single country has a similar tax plan and it allows for you to hire and manufacture locally and not get taxed when you export. \n\nIts one of the primary reasons we lose jobs to offshoring.
I know. That's why my solution didn't require any government spending.
No its because they have made it so expensive that no one can afford it.\n\nHe thought she was getting insurance because she was a rich fat cat business owner. She showed him that she can't afford to take care of herself let alone offer it to get employees.
They can in the short term. The cost might be high but they can if they try even if it blows up in 4 years.
At least one person here is informed. This kind of bullshit article is why I can't support the left.\n\nHe's doing bad things stop lying about it just report the truth for fucks sake stop being just as bad.
He didn't in this case 2015 the last year with official numbers saw a 50% rise in murder in dc. \n\nIt's a cherry picked number but it's accurate and true just used as an example when it's actually an outlier.
The question is how many lives are saved by requiring extra testing vs how many die because they can't get the drug they need because the FDA is blocking it.\n\nEvery study I've ever read shows we let hundreds die from delayed medication to save very few.
Incorrect. Founded fathers only wanted those that owned land to vote to weed out people who would just vote to enrich themselves.
Some of them definitely are some aren't. But the flood of false news against Trump forces people to him. \n\nThis for example is not evidence this is a random Russian official saying something that damages Trump. If they had Trump in their pocket they would be smart to not screw him over with stories like this. \n\nI don't doubt that Trump is a sleezebag I don't like him I hope we end up with president Paul Ryan. But this isn't a real story. 
I'd have to take a second look at him. I believe my feelings on him are compromised by MSM. I believe he was viciously attacked a while back.
The first thing about 4% growth sends completely partisan and not correct.\n\nIf you removed all regulation the economy would explode especially in the short term easily granting 4% growth.\n\nStimulus is also easy. Raise spending by 700 billion and bam 4% growth. Easy to do but not the best idea.\n\nSeems like a liberals idea of non partisan which it's still highly partisan.
He can murder any US citizen without review and with no repercussions.
I know you are closed minded but when you can't even understand half the country maybe you're the stupid one?
When poor people are stuck with whatever shitty public school they happen to be assigned to it creates a poverty cycle that is almost impossible escape. \n\nThe poor are the most likely to be trapped in horrible schools. They are also the ones who can not afford to send their children to private schools to escape the failures of public school system.\n\nAllowing parents to vote with their own tax dollars on their own children's education would be the best thing to happen to the poor in a long time.
Detroit closed schools because their population collapsed. They fought it for a long time and bankrupted themselves doing it.\n\nInstead of losing half their population and funding half as many schools they kept all schools open.  Was a horrible and corrupt way to keep public union jobs.
And this is what it was really about. Any attacks now and he'll be the one who tried to stop them and his opponents enabled it.
Democrats redefined it when they realized they didn't have to actually help anyone but could just tax other people and buy votes. 
Yeah no way someone who wants to redefine the second amendment gets into the supreme court. Garland was unpalatable to a huge number of people solely on his second amendment stand.
This article claims that white benefit from ACA.\n\nWhen someone says buy this hugely overpriced bullshit plan that you can't use or you get taxed you aren't really benefiting from the law. You are getting reamed by it.
Why are you talking about new rules? You are clearly not following the fact that they want to weaken the EPA not get any new regulations.\n\nRepublicans don't want any new regulations they want to remove them. You are acting like trump is giving executive orders and republicans are fighting.\n\nThe showing down and hampering the epa is what they want. With your math they just allowed the epa to 1/3rd the amount of work.
And republicans control that process. They are going to try and repeal the aca, lower taxes, cut Medicare Medicaid and then impeach him and be the hero's.
Fox wasn't in my comment for a reason.\n\nCNN was because they were clearly biased. Fox was also biased but Fox is supposed to be and is known to be biased.
You prefer to trap as many kids as possible into horrendous public schools?
All taxes are passed onto the consumer in one way or another. Not advocating tariffs but they are similar to corporate taxes which most people support.
I'm not arguing for or against anything in just pointing out that it gets much more complex when the protestor s start shooting which is also likely.
Banks were specifically required and subsidized to give sub prime loans. \n\nConsumer banks sms instrument banks had nothing to do with the crash. In fact banks that did both did better then those that were either just consumer or just investment.\n\nThe quality of investments meet the standards for Fanny and Freddie to buy their loans. These were governmental organisations that set the bar low in order to make banks lend to riskier people.\n\nCDOs were not a primary cause. There is nothing wrong with them. They did exaggerate the crash in some ways buy they also popped the bubble faster before more bad loans were given.\n\nYou are citing bull that even liberals like Elizabeth Warren have said aren't true.
Just having a ssn stolen can get you in trouble. It's a total pain and if it happens when you go for a loan out get audited its brutal.
Trump is not a good person and likely will be a bad president in many ways but hes right on this one... Even if its impossible to admit we are just as bad in this regard.\n\nOur hands are covered in blood on the international scale. We continue to do evil under republicans and democrats.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination_attempts_on_Fidel_Castro
Every time the left get outraged I just can't help but think "Why weren't you mad when this was happening over the last 8 years"
It's really hard to detect any satire about the left right now.\n\nThere are a ton of legitimate reasons what trump does is bad but they often just cite propaganda instead.
And he's the hero the left thinks we need and the villain that makes trump look good.
This reads like crap lots of name calling and conspiracy sounding stuff and no facts.
I don't know whats going to happen. We will find out. I expect there will be some winners and some losers and I hope no one loses too bad. 
Yeah I have. Factories were the biggest deciding factor. Specifically those that make weapons and war materials.\n\nI'll let you decide which side weapons manufacturers would land on. The legitimate government that controls the dollar or people attempting an armed revolution.
An accurate number using the latest official report?\n\nSee they didn't lie here they used an outlier as an example. It's not a lie.

Definitely not normal. My GF and I voted for different people, but we're not mean about it. Just occasional teasing ;)

They probably did it to protect animal researchers from death threats. These reports would seem to tell groups like ALF exactly where the animals are and who is inspecting the labs, making them easy to target.\n\nI'm surprised the reports aren't digital. Seems like it would be easy to redact PII in that case.
I like this sub, because its the only place both sides can go without getting banned.\n\nMaybe we could talk about issues without framing questions negatively, as that sets the conversation off to a bad start.
Long term, a degree would be best. I didn't have a degree for the first 15 years of my career, but in the 90s/early 2000's it was much easier to find jobs. Having a degree will make it easier to find high end work. Many jobs, especially government, require degrees to get past the door.\n\nMy approach was to work for 2-3 years at a time, save money, and attend college intermittently. Eventually I graduated debt free.\n\nThe best advice for being a dev with no degree is BE GOOD.

We're fighting the Russians by proxy over oil in the middle east. In the process people have died, we've rubblized the land, and created terrorists. It would be better if we made some business agreements with them.
Everything should mesh with your design philosophy. This is why SCVs auto-balance and 21:9 in Overwatch sucks.
I don't disagree.
Syria is about oil. We want a pipeline to Syria to send oil to Europe via the Mediterranean. Russia wants it through several Baltic states terminating in Turkey.\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/5wXYS6A.jpg
I think Trump will be more aggressive than Hilary in hopes to end the war. I think he's less likely to expand it to neighbors. With Hilary things would pretty much be in the same state in 2020 with more counties involved. Possibly extremely bad relations with Russia.
Is this the program where [the FBI sent informant into a mosque who pretended to be a radical](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/03/04/fbi-informant-craig-monteilh_n_6800126.html) and he creeped everyone out?\n\nI'd get rid of the program all together. These programs where you have to find terrorists lead to enticement, where they get some dumbass to set off a fake cell phone bomb, etc.\n

It's complete BS. There are plenty of US IT workers.\n\nI've worked with maybe 1-2 dozen Indian H1-B workers. Out of those 1 or 2 stood out. Most were completely average and some were truly terrible, to the point where we didn't want to let them work on anything.\n\nThe GoDaddy guy made a statement last week:\n\n> "You can't take an 18-month training program and produce a machine-learning scientist."\n\nThis is true, but it's also total BS. A PhD "machine learning scientist" is going to earn over $100k and will be exempt from the H1-B ban. The only H1-Bs he won't be able to hire are average programmers who are totally replaceable by US citizens.\n\n

maybe, but i found him to be genuine. i'll put him in my tariq ali category.
I'm hoping he won't act unilaterally to create "safe zones" in Syria. I'm pretty nervous about foreign policy right now.
He's acting quickly perhaps to avoid repeating the mistake Obama made in squandering the house and senate majority. There may never be a better time for Trump to get things done.
Try sous vide. You can get really good medium done pork and chicken. I cook it at 140F for a couple of hours.
IT worker in the University of California system. About 100 jobs at UCSF have been farmed out to India. Trump's H1-B policies could potentially affect me.
I don't think either of us knows what "incredibly strict" entails.
I think he probably met him. I have high hopes that he'll improve relations with Russia, but they are diminishing. Seems like he'll continue down the Ukraine path.
Definitely a violation.
Every President since George Washington has issued executive orders. Seems like they've been overused since the mid-late 19th century.

i'd print another space station, go there, and lock the airlock behind me.

This was one of my main reservations of voting for Trump. I think he will continue our involvement in the middle East. I think there is more hope he will end it than Hilary.

That article seemed incoherent
I'd like to see those requiring medical treatment to be excepted from the ban.\n\n> The term moral obligation has a number of meanings in moral philosophy, in religion, and in layman's terms. Generally speaking, when someone says of an act that it is a "moral obligation," they refer to a belief that the act is one prescribed by their set of values.\n\nAllowing foreigners to use our hospitals is an American value.
Idk, but it makes it so your class rank is everything.
They're nice because they come in shade/base/highlight. And they're more matte than vallejo (that can be fixed with matte varnish though).
Never the less, I think he'll do it to create safe zones. Hopefully he won't do it unilaterally.
I don't even know the current process.
Yeah. I think he'll officially go into Syria. Obama was trying to get them to kill themselves. Now we have to deal with well armed rebel\n\nDo I want this? Not really. IMO a Ron Paul foreign policy is the way to go, but neither candidate offered that.

Well, if the shit hits the fan you want some evidence that you made the right people aware of the problem, namely your direct supervisor. Perhaps even go over his head, but you have to tread carefully because people can get mad about this kind of thing. But it seems pretty important, so perhaps its OK to piss some people off. Maybe call a meeting with supervisor and QA, and demonstrate the bug.\n\nIf the CEO shows up and asks why your incompetent team didn't fix the bug you want to be able to say "well, we knew about it and escalated it, but this guy wouldn't give us the go ahead."\n\nI don't think it's a bad idea to create a patch in your "spare time" and submit it, either.\n\nDefinitely don't exploit the bug or show people how to exploit it. That might be considered criminal.
what happened?
It's a fact that more people voted for Hilary. I think the remark is based on the count of we removed California. Even if the Republics had campaigned hard in California I still don't think it would erase 3M votes or whatever it is.

The only one that bothered be is the "so-called judge" statement.

Probably an exaggeration to call it failing. Same with NYT. They recently declared a loss (-$14M 2016Q1), but their digital sales are growing. We'll see if they can pull it together.\n\nThe people in the media fired the first shot. I suppose its Presidential to shutup and take it?

The way he said it was Unpresidential, but that's Trump for ya.\n\nI'll be concerned if judges are dismissed for not ruling the "right way". I don't think the President can do this though, can he?\n\n> Do you Trump supporters appreciate and respect the separation of powers, or do you prefer an Imperial Presidency?\n\nReally? lol
I disapprove. It's just throwing shit to see if it sticks, like the old Glenn Beck meme.\n\n> Why haven’t we had an official response to the rumor that Glenn Beck raped and murdered a girl in 1990?
Naw, from everything I've seen Obama was a good father.
The community would be better without the incentive to speed run in the cheesiest way possible. You could power up your weapons with drops from Stormvermin and specials.
It kind of fits with his "drain the swamp" philosophy. Maybe it's Unpresidential, but it's also transparent.

Do not be surprised if your school suspends you or expels you for this when they find you out. I support what you're doing, but they do not fuck around when it comes to stuff like this, especially when there is a competing information campaign.

For the record, the police chief is *legally* incorrect. If you read the list of crimes which the law corresponds to, you'll find resisting arrest isn't there.\n\nOf course they probably don't give a fuck what the law actually says, but eventually a judge will.
I'd like to think he's usually the one who does it right. Do you remember bitch better have my money turned future house? Dope shit
Regardless of whether or not we sympathize a bit with the downtrodden racists, it's a matter of what is more effective in combatting them.\n\nAlso, and maybe this is naive, but I think followers of Milo are more easily persuaded to our side. Klansmen have a deep, visceral race-hatred. It's not something that can be fixed with a pamphlet and good arguments.
"Comes along"\n\nYou act like the wheels of history will magically turn and give us ultra luxury space communism. You have to fight for it.
I think this is the crux of the 'I miss old FOB' feeling. The songs Pete used to write (and Andy's drumming and Joe's guitar) had more clever twists and turns to them than the newer stuff.
Literally the best description I've ever heard of RR
The court determines all of those things on a case by case basis. If there is an issue with the amount of money, it can be raised there. If they don't agree, they can appeal the decision.\n\nIf the mother is taking care of the child (as in actually raising the damn thing, not throwing money at it like it's a leaky boat) and the father is absent then she's usualky foregoing time she could be working. It makes sense for the absent parent to compensate the one who is giving up their time for the kid.\n\nAn absent parent concerned about the money can fix all of these issues you raised by actually spending some time with the kid, y'know, maybe STEP THE FUCK UP AND TAKE RESPONSIBILITY.
Lol probably not. Bernie had big money donors too, just not nearly as many as other candidates.
Wow you *are* pretentious
"warrants" gave it away. Also pedagogy of the oppressed is a staple for any K hack
I mean, you have literally no evidence to base your assumptions about the judicial system on other than shit you've read on the internet. I think the judge would adjudicate the necessary amount to raise the child and nothing else.
I get the "yo, I want what you're on" all the time. I usually tell them willpower and sleep lol

This is the best advice here. Ignore the people who are saying 2 year age difference is weird, it's perfectly normal once you're like... older than 20.\n\nI'll say, don't fall too hard for him. I know plenty of guys who used to do this because they knew younger chicks were more naive/easy. If he really likes you he will be willing to do more than invite you to his dorm. Maybe suggest a date where there's no chance of anything sexual happening and see how he responds and how well y'all work together (picnic, movie, museum, hike, etc.).
He's 15, cut the kid some slack. Also the key to self-restraint is not facing the things that tempt you in the first place. That's why you delete all your dealers #s if you're trying to get clean.

Know that (if you live in US anyway) you have essentially ZERO free speech rights. Any literature you want to pass out or whatever else is subject to the purview of the administration. Because of this, you should not try to rock the boat until you have a sizeable presence.
I can't refute anything you're saying, since I don't know anything about that specific situation.\n\nI think the majority of cases of child support are justified. Obviously any system will have issues, but I think the current safeguards we have in place are good enough (at least where I'm from).
You should stop admitting to crimes on the internet now. 
I would change my view if the numbers showed it. My point in asking for the numbers is that I've never seen them. I've asked for them so many times I believe they don't exist at this point.
All of my opinions apply only to the US legal system and its child support. Idgaf about how japan handles it.
OP should definitely consider this. Super cheap prices.
I found him a long ass time ago and I've always wondered why he never put out any more music.\n\nRIP
Okay, I will not do the research. You've spent so much time arguing with me and posting throughout this thread if you are actually at work you're a terrible worker. If you give a shit about me changing my opinion link me the studies.
Subs don't usually like to peg in my experience. Get you some velvet rope and a ball gag. Should be a good time.

I would've loved them to get into a policy discussion actually. HRC loves to talk policy so he could really beat her on her own turf.
Do you have a court order establishing custody?
Don't get me wrong, I love the whole tape. There were a lot of songs on there that were better than Choppin Blades though.
I'd agree with you much of the newer stuff is less focused on one-liners. I'd be lying if I said that's not why I love FOB so much in the first place. Different strokes for different blokes/ladyblokes though.
I have never has a single issue with my VModa cord in the 3 years I've had them. It came with two, both kevlar braided. I chew on the damn things when I'm nervous.
You sound like you know what you're talking about. Are you an attorney who specializes in these matters?
No problem man, keep it up
Evidence of these claims?
Oh we're talking about the lesbians here? shit I thought we were talking about other bullshit. I'm arguing with so many people in this thread sorry dude
90% of people who can't handle their drugs at a show are 18 and under. If you drop to the ground next to me because you're overheating after rolling too hard, guess who has to worry about that for the next 10 minutes? Also if 21+ a lot of bartenders won't bother checking id.
Kid got PTSD from getting teabagged by dad
The guy gave up that right when he fucked around and got the chick pregnant. Both parties need to step up. You're assuming everyone involved here are rational actors making intentional decisions.
You're conflating legality with morality.
I asked a guy somewhere else, where are these numbers?
LSL and Loud Lord are my favorite purveyors of this sound.

But THAT's just speculation, unless you are literally an attorney who deals in these lawsuits. If so, can I send you my resume?
I''m struggling to understand your critique. His flow mirrors the beats perfectly on nearly every track. Can you elaborate?
but his voice and the beats on XXX do mesh? that's odd. you're totally right that it's subjective, just wanted to see if there was something else behind it.
Most of his ambassadors are donors, his Commerce secretary, others.
You talking about the Dragon's Den? That's the only solid scene I know of here. Maybe i'm just really out of the loop
That's fine, I just like to understand opposing perspectives. 
Glenn Beck (heads theblaze.com) has, on more than one occasion, said Trump is horrible for the country. He used to be a conservative libertarian. I don't know what the fuck he is now, but I'm glad he has enough sense to fuck over Milo.
There are more and more ISDS cases every year.
I know nothing about you, how could I possibly direct that toward you? \n\nIt's not ridiculous to expect assistance when the majority of the child rearing falls on one party. I don't know why you don't think that raising a child constitutes giving up time, but it absolutely does. Any single parent can tell you.\n\nAgain, not attcking you personally.
It's not ANOTHER person's decision. It's literally his decision. If you don't want to have to take care of a kid, don't get a chick pregnant. It's REALLY simple.
Right, but short of the government literally raising the child itself that's the best way we have of getting money to the child.
Called my dad. I'm really glad we can talk more, I used to be a little shit.
Did you do national circuit high school debate?
I knew you had a reddit account, I just couldn't remember the name. Keep it up and get your ass to new orleans sometime soon.
His songs are too "busy" for any kind of mainstream audience imo. I'd love to see a more minimalistic track out of him.
That can come off as irritating depending on the way you approach it. You have to be carefil to not be so aggressive.
Your set in Baton Rouge was awesome, man. Keep it up.
You don't have to engage with the worst parts of buzzfeed. Let everybody else do it, just like the worst parts of reddit. The difference is, the new york times will be bankrupt within 20 years.
Yeah I think I misread what that guy said. My point was, if one party has abdicated responsibility and the other needs assistance to raise the kid, the absent party needs to step up regardless of any contract in place. Those contracts suck if they prevent children from getting the care they need to grow up as not shitty people. 
Where'd you get those numbers? I'd love to read the report since those numbers are next to impossible to aggregate.
I would advocate not putting these up in school or even sharing them on social media where your peers can see them. There is a very real risk of getting suspended or expelled. In this sub we (myself included) lover harm-reduction and myth-debunkimg, but to the outside world it will inevitably come off as you promoting drug use.\n\nLiterally the only way I could see this being even conceivably okay is if you okayed it with the school admin first.
I know you're just turning up cause it's christmas break but try to keep a handle on that shit man.
Why can I imagine Ho Ho in his voice perfectly?
As long as it has to be extremely pissed off.
Listening to the redditor in the thread, but this sounds really close to what OP did and the lyrics he mentioned are in it and the remix, and my cat like that all the time and he loves it.

Don't vote for him.
What are you talking about?  Your dick is right up there claiming a rhetorical question isn't a rhetorical question.
So...you used coercion to make him stop seeing someone that was seeing him of her own free will?\n\nYou, sir or madame, are a true paragon of libertarianism. /s
Wow. I **loved** *Neverwhere*.  I, especially, liked Mr. Croup and Mr. Vandemar. 
It's all good.  I tend to ramble, and my point tends to get lost.  I'm cognizant of this.
No, I don't give a shit how they treat Republicans. You're the one that brought that shit up. It's how they treat Democrats that I was bitching about.  \n\nNice try, though. 
Bad analogy. I apologize. I'm exhausted and clearly thinking like an idiot. I wanted to use a body builder (those guys are frequently heavily tested). I temporarily forgot that Mr Olympia only drug tested once.   \n\nEDIT: Damnit, a COMPETITIVE body builder. 
I do imagine it's tough to top Darrow.
It is encrypted, it's just an encryption that the companies all share. 
You know what bothers me about it?  Not a single rule was broken.  Memes are welcome, here.  Stupid memes (and image macros, and political cartoons) frequently spawn great discussions.  Yet, people like Vineyard00 pop up and try to shoehorn every meme (image macro or political cartoon) off to a sub that has less than 10% of the subscribers this sub does.\n\nFuck them.  If I want to post a meme, image macro, or political cartoon in /r/libertarian, I will.
Wow.  TtH is my favorite book in the entire series.
>ANY TOWERS OUT THERE?\n\nAnd a Stingray isn't a tower.  I can stand on a street corner and scream for Bill.  That doesn't give the government the right to pretend to be Bill, and steal every bit of information I have in my pockets from me.
I usually like the hyper-realistic drawings best, but that third one took my breath away!
Because I didn't outright admit we've been invaded. \n\nYour original statement lumped me (and people like me, that have been on this sub for years) in with those idiots. THAT is what I take umbrage with.  \n\nEdit: in fact, your comment seems to imply that WE are the ones excusing this shit, since we are the ones that talked the game, then we got invaded. 
You can start him on Barsoom around the age of 6 or 7 depending on his cognition.  They really do work well as YA books or adult books.
It definitely took longer than I hoped, but that's OK.  He learned the lessons he needed to learn, and he looks to have learned them well.
>They felt it touched on the notion that the media was somehow traitorous\n\nGiven the way the media (sans FOX, who I'm not convinced can actually be called the media) served as a propaganda arm for Obama's presidency, I'd say they are traitorous.  They've forgotten what it is they are supposed to do.  If any 1 good thing comes of the Trump presidency, I hope it will be that the media stops just parroting whatever the White House wants them to parrot.
I get the feeling that you're leading up to using "a lot" like the ["Chewbacca Defense"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwdba9C2G14)...
Price with defense is a straight-up scary thought.
Based on having met Hilary in social settings more than once (before Bill was POTUS). 
Read your comment. You're bitching about us preaching 1 thing, then not following through. We bitched, Trump won, we got invaded, they upvote bullshit. It's not the same people upvoting that were doing the bitching. Your comment completely ignores that, and assumes it's all the same people. 
Somewhere around arc 25, I think.
Are there any xianxia reader apps for the translations? Something similar to a manga app, maybe? 
Just make sure you point it down range.
Nope.  Entirely based on her and her personality.  I wouldn't put a single thing past that woman.  She's fucking *scary*.
Damn, after wishing for one for over 20 years, in not sure I can wait for Cyberpunk... Time to hack in so I can play the game early and accidentally set off WW3. 
You're kidding, right? Reddit has the absolute worst search function I've seen since the 1990s. It's laughable to expect it to return results. 
Maybe I should have put my post here... Please forgive me for the copy/paste. \n\nWhat's the name of the series Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon is from? Heavenly Sword, or something like that? I want to read those books. 
Funny you should mention...I'm in the middle of a re-listen to Red Rising, and am thinking about moving on to Ryria, next.  A TGR-athon, if you will.
Yeah, I got the fishies part.  It's the walking part that throws me all out of whack.
Yes, because the last time I directly responded to the shit you're flinging around, you tried making the responses look like I'm a Republican that is upset with the Republican treatment from the press. Strawman me once, shame on you, strawman me twice, shame on me. \n\nIf you wanted to have a real conversation about this, you would have stuck to what I said and left out what you wanted me to say. 
>That 'specialized equipment' is a radio receiver, which is to say it isn't terribly specialized.\n\nYou would receive the signal, but it would be garbled.  You *do* have to have specialized equipment to read the signal.  I apologize that I wasn't more specific.  The Constitution doesn't draw any sort of a line about specialized equipment, but it's pretty obvious that if they can't go into my house and read my journal without a warrant, then spying on me using specialized high-tech equipment isn't cool, either.  i.e. I brought up specialized equipment to show that they have to go out of their way to receive and make sense of these signals, that they aren't just there to be read the way you make it sound.
>Having a device that essentially listens to signals that you yourself are shouting out loud doesn't invade your privacy or search you in any way.\n\nAbsolutely not.  The Constitution clearly limits the government's ability to go into my personal effects (just because it's electronic doesn't make it not my effects).\n\n>Think of it this way, if you went around yelling your phone number out loud, you certainly wouldn't claim that a cop standing nearby illegally searched you when he linked your phone number to other information about you.\n\nThis isn't even close to correct.  This is nowhere near the same thing as shouting your phone number for the world to hear.  Since you need specialized equipment to get my phone number, or to accept those signals, this is more akin to writing my phone number on a piece of paper, and having you steal it from my pocket.\n\n>You're re-writing the Constitution to say what you think the Constitution ought to say because you want extra rights.\n\nYou, clearly, don't understand how rights work.  The Constitution doesn't give us rights.  It just enshrined a number of rights, and makes clear concession that the rights enumerated aren't all of them.  The Constitution doesn't give anything to the citizens.  It takes power away from the government by clearly defining what it is allowed to do.
Hey, Fuck You. \n\nI despise the man, and fully expect him to be impeached (and to deserve it). He's done some things that have surprised me (in a good way), but I don't give him a pass for killing the little girl. I think he deserves a supermax cell next to Obama and Bush for her murder alone. \n\nBecause this sub has been invaded is absolutely no excuse for your bullshit blanket statement that lumps everyone that disagrees with this shit in with the people excusing the Idiot in Chief. \n\nSo, you can just fuck right off with your bullshit idiocy. 
Oh, I already own and have listened to all of the Ryiria books and Gentleman Bastards. I'm re-listening. 
God forbid you be against rocks and live in Phoenix.
Same for me.  My dad got me into reading with The Hobbit.  He had all of Edgar Rice Burrough's Tarzan books, and I found all of the Barsoom books.  We would trade off every-so-often, to re-read the series we didn't have sitting on the shelf in our room (because walking the 5 feet to his room was too much of a task, I guess).  Lastly, I turned him on to Harry Potter just before Order of the Phoenix came out.  When my dad finally passes, I think I'm going to have to give Tolkein, Burroughs, and Rowling another read; just to remember the good times.
Apparently...I REALLY need to read the short stories...
It doesn't have a thing to do with the fact that she is a woman. 
Homer glasses.  No, Nick never did this kind of thing, but Stevie was fucking FIERCE on the ice.  He used his stick liberally.
*THIS* meme, sure.  Plenty of other memes don't add anything new, but spark really great conversation.\n\nAlso, the fact that there's a sub dedicated to memes doesn't mean shit.  There's barely anyone there compared to this sub.
Context?\n\nFor instance, are you the baby?
>Also she called a gay dude a homophobe.\n\nShe also said he was a platform to call for the genocide of blacks.  He's a homophobe that says he's almost exclusively attracted to black men that wants black men eradicated.  That's some real self-loathing there, isn't it?
You are a moron.  There is a very clear definition of treason:\n\n>Treason against the United States, shall consist only in levying War against them, or in adhering to their Enemies, giving them Aid and Comfort.\n\nThe Founders thought treason was so serious an issue that it is, literally, the only crime mentioned in the Constitution.  I'm sick of listening to people throw around "That's treason!" like they have a fucking clue.  Snowden and Manning didn't commit treason.  Neither did Assange, who isn't even American.  The media can lie about the President until the entire nation is blue in the face, and IT ISN'T TREASON.\n\nGet a fucking clue, you moron.
What the US has done to the AlAwlaki family is inexcusable. 
Wouldn't a Devils fan go up in flames with Rangers flair? 
I couldn't handle the first book, because of Jalan. I tried the Audiobook, and it was a different story. Something about the tone of Tim Gerard Reynolds' voice actually made Jalan enjoyable. 
Thanks.  I've wondered about this for a long time, now.  Now that I know the name of the series, I can try to find it.
I think it's mostly the opening 1/4 of the book that causes people to say this.  That said, as much as I absolutely despised Karsa Orlong at the beginning of the book, he was one of my favorite characters by the end of his section.  That was probably the single best instance of character development I've ever read.
Actually, that's a really good point. They certainly were cheerleaders during all of that. 
That's your own bias leaking through.  Women in power don't scare me in the slightest.  *People* with no apparent sense of right and wrong beyond what's good for their careers are frightening.  *People* in positions of power with no sense of right and wrong beyond what's good for their careers are nightmare inducing.  These *people* include the likes of Donald Trump, Barack Obama, Hilary Clinton, and Dick Cheney.\n\nSo keep your bullshit knee-jerk assumptions to yourself, and just fuck right off.\n\nEDIT:  It just so happens that I've met Hilary more than once, and I know what kind of person she is even in a casual environment.  The fact that she's a woman didn't enter this conversation until your completely unfounded accusation with no factual basis whatsoever.
Don't forget all the times they say he hates black people, but he's self-professed to be almost exclusively attracted to black guys.
Holy Shit!!!  What the fuck are those things?!?
I'm not crying. This video just has that new technology where they put onions in. 
I don't typically use gaming subreddits, so I had no idea the search function would actually work for a change.  Thanks for the tip.  That can save me from having to post in the future.  I appreciate it.\n\nAs far as looking through the sub before I posted, I did.  I saw nothing about the Midgar stuff for 2 pages.  If I'd been on PC, it might have been different, I get results from the two for some reason that I've never figured out.
I would have absolutely no issues with that.\n\nFun Fact:  Shanny holds the record for most Gordie Howe Hat Tricks with 17 (Howe only has 2).
How about what an [Emmy Award winning journalist had to say about it](http://nypost.com/2014/10/25/former-cbs-reporter-explains-how-the-liberal-media-protects-obama/)?\n\nOf course, they supported the Tea Party.  They saw it as the death of the Republican party.  I refer you back to Sharyl Atkisson about Benghazi.  They only talked about the birther nonsense, because it was such utter nonsense it would never be taken seriously by sane people.\n\nI don't understand how you can't look at their track record and *not* see how they're Obama's cheerleaders.
Yet, you're still using what we said BEFORE the invasion to make us look like hypocrites. 
The intent was clarification. The actual wording came across like they caught Ilitch in a lie. They give the obligatory 1 statement to say he was a generous guy, then continue on in a tone that read like he was trying to hype himself and they were out to prove the lie. \n\nIt was just WAY too smug. Especially with that opening sentence. 
Of course...the answer is in the 1 place I did not look... The news page inside the game. Now, I feel stupid. \n\nThanks for the link. 
See, proof you don't want a real conversation. You are the one that brought up Republicans. That makes you the Duck. 
He was better than Bush?  Sure, if you like blowing up brown people because they decided to go to the wrong wedding, or if you like 200+ percent increases on your now mandatory health insurance.  He did like 3 good things in 8 years, none of which was worth all of the bad he did.\n\nYeah, he was better than Bush.  Better the same way [Phil Heath's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phil_Heath) muscles would be better if he took steroids.
I don't want to do 2 immediate edits in a row, so here's another post (I keep accidentally submitting, because I'm on mobile). \n\nNo, Trump would have to fundamentally change his character before I would jump on his bandwagon. That said, I can give him props for doing something I agree with. Like his SCOTUS nomination. \n\nI still think every president that has given the OK for a strike on foreign soil with a country we're not at war with is guilty of war crimes. Most especially if it ends in the death of a civilian. 
Don't you love the way he sounds so outraged?  He sounds like someone just kicked in his front door and stole shit from his house...
Honestly, with the tools at his disposal, Mantha has everything it takes to be a real nightmare for opposing teams.  He's starting to use his size to his advantage, which is good.  The more comfortable he gets with that style of play, the more promising he becomes.
Threaten?   \nNo\n\nActually do it?   \nWithout a doubt 
Each of the three LotR books is divided into 2 books. Book 4 is the 2nd half of The Two Towers. The part with Sam and Frodo getting through the marsh. It is exceedingly boring. 
Yeah, sorry.  SE is Steven Erikson, and ICE is Ian Cameron Esselmont.
I'm not sure, but I think that makes you Satan's Avatar. 
Don't forget that they kept the civilian number down by classifying all males from around 14 to 65 as enemy combatants. I'm not sure when that started. It wouldn't surprise me if Bush's regime started it. \n\nBoth of them deserve supermax cells for the rest of their lives for war crimes. \n\nShit Trump has been in office for about 5 minutes, and he's already managed to have a member of the AlAwlaki family killed. He deserves a cell, too. 
This is someone trying to be "edgy" and post something "relevant" to the current hot button issue of the press.\n\nThis is also someone failing to be "edgy" with their post.
I take it you haven't heard about Anwar AlAwlaki's daughter? 
Anarcho Capitalists are anarchists, and they fall under the libertarian umbrella.
If only I had thought to use Google. \n\nI did. \n\nThere was nothing for 5 pages except articles about the event and walk throughs on how to start it. 
That's pretty fucking awesome. :)
Be careful what you wish for. I once considered that I would like some time in Philip K Dick's head. Then, I remembered all the mental issues he struggled with. Needless to say, I changed my mind. 
/u/the_ancient1 will take on anyone. 
>The rights granted by The Bill of Rights\n\nMight I recommend you change the wording to say "The rights enshrined" or "The rights protected" or "The rights enumerated"?  All 3 of those uses are accurate.  The usage you used is not.  Like /u/the_ancient1 pointed out, you have those rights without the Constitution.  The Framers just felt they were important enough to list.
You can, but I don't recommend it on a first read.  The difference in the authorial voice between ICE and SE is so different that it's going to be very jarring.\n\nIn addition, some things in ICE's books are spoiled by SE and some things in SE books are spoiled by ICE.  ICE's books were written later, therefore with the expectation that the stuff SE spoiled would already be spoiled.  Not the other way around.\n\nAll that is leaving out the fact that you would need to read *Midnight Tides* 3 or 4 books earlier than it is in the main series order if you were doing a chronological read.
>A free press is critical to a tyrannical government.\n\nHuh?\n\nAlso, our press isn't free.  They've been the lapdogs and propaganda machines for the White House for about 8 years, now.  (Not counting Fox, which I'm not sure you can count as press to begin with.)
A bottle of motrin and 2 weeks of light duty. \n\nMy ACL got shredded in an accident at PT. I was given a bottle of motrin and 2 weeks of light duty over and over again for a year and a half. Finally, after transferring to a new duty station, I met a doctor willing to send me to orthopedics. 5 minutes into my first appointment, the doctor knew what was wrong. \n\nGotta love that military medicine. 
What's the name of the series Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon is from? Heavenly Sword, or something like that? I want to read those books. 
I haven't seen 2, yet.  I probably won't get to while it's in theaters, because I don't have the slightest clue when I'm getting another day off.  I will say this about the 1st installment.  I wanted to jump into the screen and kill those sons of bitches myself when they [John Wick spoiler](#s "offed the dog").  The follow-up scene [further spoiler](#s "where the dog had dragged itself across the floor to die next to John")...my nephew took 1 look at me, and suggested we pause the movie and go outside to smoke a cigarette.
Most times, a plea bargain is not any kind of bargain at all.  They charge you with everything they can even tenuously logic their way through.  The old spaghetti method.  Now, you're facing 350 years in jail because someone sent you a text.  Then, they throw you a lifeline.   One you would turn down in a heartbeat if you weren't staring down the barrel of 350 years in prison.  You grab that lifeline, because a man falling off a cliff will grab at a spiderweb to try to stop the fall.\n\nIt's simple coercion.  There's no other way around it.
Thank you! 
Except these people pop up every single time a meme gets posted, and they can (and have) gotten nasty about it.  The only thing I projected onto this guy's post was the past history of people bitching about memes in this sub.
>The bill of rights does not grant you rights, nor does it enumerate your rights.\n\nBy that, I assume you mean it doesn't enumerate *all* of our rights?  Because it does, in fact, enumerate some of them.
No, I'm baffled by everyone overlooking the fact that the kid actually didn't *DO* anything.  He received texts.  To not receive the texts, the would have had to foretell the future.
At least some of Bush's body count actually wore uniforms and toted assault rifles. A ridiculous percentage of Obama's body count is women, children, and teenage men that have done nothing wrong except going to the wrong Yemeni wedding. 
Thomas Jefferson: "When a law is unjust then man is not only Right to disobey it, he is obligated to do so."
I said they've been Obama's cheerleaders. That's my claim. It doesn't matter how they treat Republicans, unless they're cheerleading for them, too. \n\nThat's the whole POINT of my post. The only twisted thinking is yours. If they are big meanies to Republicans, that's a good thing. Where is them being big meanies to Democrats (more specifically to Obama)? They are supposed to report what's going on with a healthy dose of skepticism. They haven't for 8 years. If you can't understand that point, then you are beyond help. 
I can't think of any company I would rather have doing this game. 
It's mind-boggling. That's what it is. 
This is such a piss-poor straw man that it isn't even worth a real response. 
The single best storyline in that book.
I'm not sure about ICE publication dates.  My recommendation to all first reads is to read the main 10 book series in order, then to mix and match the Kharkanas trilogy and the ICE books in whatever order you want after that.
The point /u/ChinchillaRaptor was making is that the 5th provides protection from deprivation of property without due process of law.  When they take your property and charge it with a crime, they are still depriving you of your property without due process.\n\nIt is a procedure with absolutely no footing found anywhere in the Constitution.
Thanks, man.
I'm baffled.  This article, one of the psychologists in the article, and even comments in this thread are all ignoring the biggest point of all.  This boy did absolutely nothing wrong.  He was sent 5 texts.  Was he supposed to tell the future, and know she was going to send these texts, so he could block her from sending them?  That is, literally, the only way he could have stopped himself from receiving these pictures.  If anyone should get in trouble, it's the girl that sent him the pictures.\n\nAlso, I thought the US didn't follow Sharia Law?  I mean, to consider this pornography...it's no different than her going out in a bathing suit.  The only place I'm aware of that clothing covering privates is considered indecent is places that live under Sharia Law.
If Mr Olympia takes steroids, his muscles get bigger. 
Except I'm more than twice that old, and I hold none of the views he's attributing to me. Please show where I brought up the media's treatment of Republicans as negative. You can't, because I didn't. They're supposed to be skeptical of the government, and they haven't been. That's my claim. He's danced around that claim, throwing up dirt and shit, hoping my point will get lost in the noise. \n\nPlease, oh world weary Sage...show me where the media (sans the sycophants at FOX) have been skeptical of or hostile to Obama. 
Guy trying to jump the Yield on Green during a yellow light, Cop trying to rush the Yellow to avoid the Red and speeding quite excessively without light or siren...\n\nI find both at fault.\n\nGlad no one was seriously injured.\n\nSide note: Sadly, most police deaths happen because of Car accidents than anything else... mostly because they seem to steadfastly refuse to wear their seatbelts.\n\nIf they have ever issued a ticket for not wearing a belt, and refuse to wear one themselves, I can't find sympathy for them when they get injured in an accident.
Worse than that... scientists last year discovered a way to quickly and cheaply recreate DNA. They can take a DNA chart that tells them what your (or anyone's) DNA is and convert organic material to recreate YOUR DNA. So it's not just going to pass a basic DNA test, it IS your DNA. \n\nBasically cloning the DNA structure at it's most basic.
Big bore... too loose, wouldn't enjoy.
In my mind I reckon the pirates as Reavers, then it starts to make sense.
Related info: Any automated speeding/red light ticket you receive in the mail is not considered to be legally binding. In VA it must be hand delivered by an agent of the court (cop or process server for example) in order for it to be legally considered to be served to you.\n\nAs such, any tickets mailed to you can be ignored without (lawful) repercussion. I say 'lawful' because a court may try to over extend their authority unlawfully, but that's another story for another time.\n\nJust like with many Rights that the gov't tramples... if EVERYONE were to exercise their Rights to the fullest extent it would bring the system to a halt. They have no where near the manpower required to hand deliver hundred and hundreds of tickets by hand. The automated ticket system would disapear in a few short years by the sheer cost of doing business.\n\nAt the moment it relies heavily on people just paying the ticket by mail without fighting it. I mean HEAVILY. If suddenly they have to pay hundreds an hundreds of people to hand deliver tickets day in and day out... it would not last long.
There is a saying in the motorcycle community: *Never* outride your headlights.\n\nThis is a prime example of the saying. Do not go faster than you can see AND be able to stop in time to avoid an accident.
Fun note: Slavery is still legal in the US.\n\nJust not legal for you or I, but legal for the govt. Go read the 13th Amendment: you can still be enslaved if you are convicted of a crime...
They have been involved in gun cases before, but it's a regional thing. I agree that most of the places would not.
Exactly why optimization is needed in games... even with very similar PC's people can get vastly different performance.
"The voice of God speaks!"
Oh man, I was distracted at that point and missed his reaction. That was golden! And he immediately jumps on the attack to demand Phillips ID as a defense against his humiliation.
In the US fire code states that to LEAVE a building (in case of fire) should require no secondary access device. no keys, no badges, no personnel buzzing you through, no locks that come unlocked when the fire alarm rings (because it might not ring and then you'd be stuck). Deadbolts must have a bar handle for egress: no double keyed deadbolts... a person leaving must be able to turn the handle to escape a fire, period.\n\nTHAT is the purpose of those signs telling you where to go in case of fire... it shows the nearest exit that requires ZERO restrictions on getting out.\n\nSo yes, that building the guy was in would be a field day for the Fire Marshal.\n\nThere are minor and specific exceptions like a bank vault or Decontamination chamber, jails etc etc... but a regular business or residential building is covered under the above rules, and more, with very few exceptions.
Not against simply wearing masks... but wearing a mask *for the purpose of concealing ones identity* with the supposed undertone of "during the commission of a crime" but sadly I have seen but one such law in the US actual outright say that second part.\n\nOtherwise Halloween would be illegal, ski masks and Balaclava would be outright illegal, face scarves and Muslim Hijab and Burqa's would be illegal, children school plays would be illegal if anyone wears a mask for character simply because they covered the face. Hollywood films where anyone gets makeup that severely alters their looks as well...
He really should have demanded their ID as well... for the lawsuit.
Exactly. Not committing any offense means this was an illegal stop. Unlawfully detained under the 4th amendment. Doesn't matter how magnanimous their stated intentions are. They are pulling people over under threat of arrest or even death... what do you think would happen if they try to pull someone over and that person refuses to stop? Now they will forcefully pull you over and arrest you for resisting arrest and failure to obey... and they won't have any RAS/PC to justify the initial stop.\n\nJust plain illegal practice and should NOT be condoned.
Sadly the police have 'contracts' with may of the giant corporations and strong arm smaller mom and pops into signing such so that they have authority to enforce vehicle code on the premises (and other non criminal code as they see fit). Otherwise you would be correct, they would have no authority to enforce such non criminal laws on private property.
There is a difference in law between a fine, a fee and a tax (though courts many times consider a fine and a tax to be nearly the same).\n\nA fee pays for a specific service for the person paying for that service, a tax is a collection of money to pay for many services for many people (regardless of the intended purpose of a particular tax, all taxes go into a general fund THEN get divvied out).
I've seen court officials argue that traffic tickets are both criminal and civil, because they don't even know themselves.
Best to run through the videos and articles archived within and you'll find plenty of people you can contact that perfectly fit the persona you are looking for. Put on that good ole Journalist hat of ole (ala Woodward and Bernstein era) and hunt down those who can answer your questions in a more interview style for your story.\n\nAre you looking for raw stats or actual accounts of events?
I was hoping the article would actually explain HOW due process was removed. How exactly were they implemented that didn't allow the citizen the proper way to fight them?\n\nHere in VA any ticket you receive in the mail is not considered a binding legal document. You can safely ignore it. An agent of the court (a cop, processor etc etc) has to physically and in person hand you the ticket for it to count.\n\nIf only people actually new this rule... all red light camera's and speed cameras would get shut down quick as there is not enough manpower to hand out all those tickets in person one by one.
Why? If they cannot make the right decisions so that they consistently get overturned (hello 9th circuit...) then why should they be allowed to keep their job if they are 'wrong' so often... when being wrong puts citizens through more trials and ordeals and costs them tons more money for their mistake of law?\n\nThis isn't a hollywood movie where a judge goes in the back and comes out with a decision 20 minutes later... a judge can adjourn/recess the court while he does his own research into the relevant law for weeks to make sure he comes to the Right decision.\n\nIf their decisions are no better (or worse) than a flip of the coin... then they have failed at their job.
Normally I see tons of cops going up and down my street all day since I live a couple miles down the same road from them... on Sunday I didn't see a single one.\n\nEntire communities abandoned so they can run their checkpoints...
Worse... cops freak out when you attempt to make them reach even an inch into the vehicle to retrieve your papers... and this cop just shoves his arm inside.
Maybe he's just attracted to power...
They cannot flat out deny access but delaying access has been upheld before... and the courts haven't set a hard time limit yet.\n\nSo technically they can 'delay' you access and hold you in a solitary cell for days while they 'investigate'.
With how most courts seem to be... even IF you get him to admit it and got it on tape you're still fucked.

>The officer has been suspended and fired from the department prior to this incident but was recently reinstated. \n\nWonder of Wonders...\n\nWho's surprised?
The slow motion of the action coupled with the text from the officers report is a good example of how (assuming it's not outright lies) the cop can view things one way but reality is completely different. Video is THE expert witness.
Gotta remember though, every thing they did was perfectly legal and does not fit the legal definition of brandishing.\n\nNot necessarily defending them, but I think the point is to show how cops completely over react to a completely legal activity.
Obligatory response: http://imgur.com/lIThL4Z
I try to keep about 2/3 my forward thrust at least. I like a little drift in my flight path.
They can move the suspect a short distance for safety,  but cannot be removed from the immediate vicinity. They could argue that the cop car was close enough to count... I would argue that the cop is dragging him hundreds of feet onto private property against his will.
An arbitrary list... like being a felon? or the growing number of misdemeanors now eligible to remove your 2A rights? Or having someone do your finances for you while on Social Security? Or any number of excuses to make people register their guns with the gov't or apply for permits/licenses? 
I have two state issued driver's licenses... I technically could do this and still have one uncontaminated.
He's my favorite speaker at Def Con, always love him.
Honestly, it would have been awesome if episode 1 of the Permadeath was the into with a scorpion and then death... then 10 minutes of him playing RCT mobile instead.\n\nThen part two is the real start.

It's not a ski mask, is a balaclava.\n\nAlso, it's Michigan in Feb... average temp in Feb is 15-25 degrees. Add wind and it feels like -14 sometimes.
Hey, I think I know where he is. Not too far from a set of lava caves I went exploring this morning. There are some interesting things in those caves I think he'd enjoy seeing... just not until he gets some better gear.
Accurate to real life.
I've tried searching around... exactly what does the command -sm4 do?
Yup. Doesn't matter if they are an asshole or not... a Right is a Right and I will defend those Rights no matter how much of an idiot they are.
Probably something he learned in class that is not normal nomenclature outside of the learning environment... but isn't smart enough to realize it.
The easiest way to completely curb aggressive policing in one single day: fire all your police.\n\nBoom instantly zero aggressive policing.\n\nThe town has 3500 people... they can survive policing themselves if the people wake up and stop expecting the gov't to prop them up with balsa wood.
He's damn close with how much he bitches about sex and the lack thereof.
The only people who need your SSN are people who are required to report your income to the IRS.
No, the impossible would be a general carry license (or not needing a license in the first place). Yours was merely highly unlikely and a wish on a hope.
Paid vacation and OT for court appearences. It's rare that any meaningful punisher occurs. Even if fired, many times the Unions will cover costs until they get their jobs back for them.
> Or to put it another way, if I drive the speed limit in every county in VA, my chances or getting a speeding ticket are the same ... ZERO.\n\nFalse. That assumes that the number of corrupt cops are also zero, which is a bold claim to make.
Which I personally think is bullshit... the Constitution instructs the gov't in ow it acts... doesn't matter if it's US soil or not, on the border or not... or even a US citizen or not. The constitution should apply to the GOVERNMENT directly regardless of circumstances.
They frequent this sub it seems. Make a post, they'd probably see it ( I do believe the dev's are also moderators for the sub as well).\n\nOtherwise you can go to the official forums, I think there was a section for Suggestions and Ideas somewhere.
Most jaywalking laws say that if you enter the intersection at any time that there is a red or red/orange blinker then it's illegal to cross unless already in the crosswalk. Said another way, the only lawful way to cross is during the White Crossing signal, once it changes to any indicator of 'do not cross' then you cannot enter the crosswalk even if the timer says you have 15 seconds or 15 years to cross. I'd be interested in seeing the JW code for where you were that day...﻿
When I get home I am going to build a spear that goes super fast and aim at a large ship... then hop out into my tiny drone just before impact. Ahould be fun to test, even if it doesn't kill the guy.
I just "tested" this while building my new ship... paid attention to costs whenever I was about to press the Undo button. Lost 80k Xanion during the course of building my ship because the Undo button COSTS me the ore and credits instead of refunding them.\n\nSo a mistake costs TWICE as much using the undo button. But selecting the item and deleting seemed to work.\n\nEvery damn time I used the Undo button it cost me ore and credits and refunded nothing.\n\nI seriously hope this is broken an not intended...
Unfortunately most companies see IT as a necessary evil... and so they try to starve the evil with low budgets and denying requisition requests and attempts to upgrade systems to keep security up to date... Because it all costs money and they don't see IT as a part of the company that MAKES money for them, only costing money and hurting their bottom line.\n\nIf you spend any time over at /r/talesfromtechsupport you'll find post after post of an idiot executive that does things or gives orders based on his own sense of urgency and self worth. Repeatedly ignoring all attempts to inform them of the dangers of said decisions/orders.\n\nIn a situation like this an executive (or family/friends thereof) probably bought his own equipment because he felt he (being as important as he is) didn't need to follow the internal IT process to get new equipment. Then later calls IT to complain about his devices not connecting to the system and he needs all the same access his previous devices had.\n\nSo now you have an unregistered device that isn't encrypted and running basic windows that is connected to their internal network with probably only the most basic of firewalls to protect it. \n\nOh... and the password is 1234 if they even put on one.
LOL, butt hurt security guard realized he couldn't intimidate the guy so he called a real cop over 'to help this individual'... the individual who is merely telling him to mind his own business and leave him alone. Last ditch effort to 'put him in his place' backfired as even the cops backed off when the guy wouldn't bend over.\n\nWell done.
Dear God I hope they optimize it at least partially before a full release date is announced. It will do them no good to advertise a finished product and people come to forums like this and see people STILL complaining about poor performance on high end machines right up to launch. will stunt their sales more than it is now I think.
If I recall it was that he was initially.suspected of a violent felony and the suspect was armed and dangerous. But the K9 officer oly heard the call for backup for such a suspect and never heard any call clearing the scene. So when he arrived he was user the assumption that the guy was in a standoff with cops while armed... so he instantly deployed the dog without assessing the situation at all.\n\nHe of course blamed the officers that were already on scene for not warning g him... when he gave them no ability/time to warn.
> State legislatures keep hacking income taxes for rich people\n\nHate to burst your bubble, but the tax code has ALWAYS been designed for 'rich people'... aka business owners. It was never designed to be in favor of the general worker/employee.
Last time I did that (probably ten years ago) I got contacted for MONTHS in emails and calls and letters about that type of product/service by all manners of companies.\n\nNever again will I give out contact info when just doing basic market research.
They expect to ~~be stopped~~ have police stop by. That is fine, and lawful depending... What shouldn't happen is exactly what we saw in this video: cops pointing guns and yelling and screaming for a completely lawful activity.\n\nThere was one I saw recently where the cops almost came to a screeching stop in their patrol cars and did just this, yelling and screaming, giving orders while pointing their guns at the OC activists and threatening to kill them. The OC guys asked if they were being detained and the cop said No, so the group turned and walked away and left the cops scratching their heads in confusion at being foiled by the Constitution. They had no authority to detain them, let alone point guns and give orders... so all their actions against the OCer's were unlawful and they had no leg to stand on, and got called on it.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/2O9hyNHt10k?t=122
I don't disagree... but it will probably be another 100 years or so till the hysteria about the image wears off.
Expect a PINAC article in the coming week. They are looking into it.
The last optimization they did is the only reason I could play at all. When I first bough the game I got about 5 fps, fiddled with the settings and managed 15 fps... didn't play it for over a year because of this.\n\nThen they did one pass and I can now play at an average of 45, sometimes dips to 30 when I can see far distances and solid 60 in caves or buildings.
One way to ensure a single player game doesn't get bogged down by too many active systems is make a Station part that keeps the sector alive while the player is gone.\n\nMinecraft (and other games) did this to keep chunks the player selected loaded and active while the player went off. The part was late in the game and expensive (to greatly discourage spamming) but very useful for keeping machine running and plants growing.\n\nI can see a similar system in Avorion. Make a very expensive Station part that requires Og or Av metal that keeps the sector active for mines and traders.\n\nMake it so the game doesn't simulate enemies in that sector unless the enemies were there when the player was there to save even more server load.
That's what gets me about it too. All the crosswalks  near me dont start timers until they do not cross signals start flashing. Therefore it's his function the same way mine do then if there's any numbers at all it was illegal for him to start Crossing at that time.\n\nOn the flip side during my time in DC every single crosswalk has a timer and the flashing signals for cross/no cross are separate from the timer.
>The   district   court   ultimately   granted   \nsummary judgment in favor of the Defendants (the cops) on all claims.\n\nAs it always happens. You RARELY ever get any justice at all at the lower courts. They just rubber stamp everything in favor of the gov't and let the higher ups do the dirty work of figuring out what exactly happened.\n\nWe really should have a sytem in place that if your Judgement as a Judge gets overturned a certain number of times, or a percentage of decisions get reversed then you automatically lose your job. Make it a requirement to be in that position that they MUST do their due diligence or face summary dismissal.
Even shielded wires will pick up interference from high voltage and gig amperage wires running in tandem for hundreds and hundreds of feet.\n\nIdeally all sound cabling and power cabling get their own channels to run down so they have zero interaction over long distances.
What is that... 10-15 people standing around because one guy is on the sidewalk with a camera?\n\nThat building probably has hundreds of cameras both inside and out and yet they don't care about THOSE cameras.
Insurance premiums will be a tad higher because it's business class, but it's usually not bad.\n\nThe price of privacy.

Start an LLC (not hard or terribly expensive) and register the car to the LLC as a business asset. That way when they run the plates it comes back with the company info and not your personal info.
Do note that image number three, 3 types down and 4th over...\n\nThis style of Terracotta is most likely going to be changed as it makes a Swastika. We'll see how long the devs keep it in...
> No, its worth whatever bethesda is willing to sell it for\n\nNope, not how the market works. If no one is willing to pay what Bethesda is asking for it, it's not worth that much because no one is paying for it at that price.\n\nIt's worth is determined by the price people are actually willing to pay for it.\n\nLet's say Apple releases a new phone, priced at $2000. Is it worth $2000? Maybe, a few people may pay for it... probably the crazy Apple fans, 10-20,000 of them. But would they sell tens of millions of them like they usually do? Probably not. \n\nBut then they drop the price to $750 and now they sell it like hotcakes and meet their usual sales goals of 75 million sold.\n\nIs the phone worth $2000 or $750?\n\nHere's a more simplistic example: I buy a car for 15k, take the engine out and then try to sell the car without an engine for 20k. Hey, it's MY car and I say it's worth $20k, even if it has no engine.\n\nIs the car really worth $20k just because that's the price tag I slapped onto it? \n\nIf no one is willing to pay the price I set... is it really worth that price? If no one is willing to pay the price Bethesda sets... is it really worth that price?
On my current half built design I am design g a Core Ship then adding on modular parts that can break off. That way if they penetrate my shields they act as ablative armor and my Core Ship can still escape and be perfectly flyable all on its own.
That sounds awfully like parallel construction...
He probably thinks 'Gun Free Zone' signs deter criminals as well.
I cannot disagree.
If I recall, the fees for permits are supposed to go entirely to paying for the process, not to the general coffers or police budgets... they are not supposed to be making a profit off of these fees, it is supposed to be a zero sum game.\n\nIf he is making THAT much as he claims, he is VASTLY over charging for permits.
I was agreeing with you... you talked about getting the ball rolling, a slipper slope if you will. \n\nI merely listed some items that have already begun the ball rolling, we are already on the slippery slope.
It's a phenomenon I have mentioned before, it's all cops though. Cops seem to read the title of the law, and ignore the text and court cases that define the law. They seem to derive their entire understanding of law from the title itself.\n\nSo in the case of Texas cops they read a law with the title of "Failure to Identify" and assume that someone must ID whenever asked, period. \n\nEdit: and the cop reading the 38.02 law out loud and not comprehending one word he's saying (other than 'Failure to Identify') in this video is a prime example.
It's edited, the person behind the scenes is most often not hearing what's going on unless they are RIGHT about to go on stage. Probably a stage hand talking to her or a producer trying to elicit reactions for ratings.
that last one... if you rotate them around you can make Swastika's... probably not going to make it to the live update.
I fully plan on buying a tow truck for just these instances in the coming years. I will give them an opportunity to explain what OFFICIAL police business they are conducting that allows them to park the way they are (as emergencies and responding to calls does allow them much leeway from the being strictly forced to follow vehicle code).\n\nIf determined they are on personal business, or like this guy driving  a personal vehicle, then it gets towed and dropped off at the nearest police station.\n\nWill I get arrested? Sure. Will it stop me? Nope.\n\n
At the moment the universe is finite as far as asteroids go... but trading stations get restocked so you can technically buy an infinite amount of ore over time. In an interview the dev's said they are looking I to ways to restock already visted sectors without it breaking immersion... like having a giant asteroid appear out of nowhere right in front of your ship  \n\nStil in development.
But what if I buy an Early Access Car? One that is specifically sold to me unfinished and still being designed and worked on and am told this before I buy it several times? Do I still have the right to complain about it being unfinished and being worked on when that is exactly what I paid for?\n\nYes, some Early Access developers (read that as few and far between) will take extra steps to ensure their Early Gamers have good experiences, but that isn't the norm nor was it part of the4 package you paid for.\n\nJust be happy an Early Access title you paid for is still getting regular updates. Out of the thousands and thousands of games that go into Beta/Early Access, few ever get to a Full Release that is worthy of the name. Most of them just get outright abandoned (hello most kickstarter games).
Quite.
Especially if they cloned the phone instead of just merely copying info from it... NASA needs to change ALL his connection protocols like VPN access because now they have full access like he does.
Or like they did to Worden where they handcuffed him and then caused pain in order to get him to open his hand so they could use an electronic fingerprint scanner on him...\n\nI do hope he puts in a lawsuit about that. Seems like a massive overstepping of authority but we don't have any case that particularly fits that situation I don't think.
Also looking for needle marks.
I was really hoping the story would have a Disaster pop up, you head to DR and everything is gone again.
>"tail light is out"\n\n>>No it isn't. Look, it works just fine.\n\n>"It was out when i stopped you, get it looked at or I'll pull you over again. Now, Papers Please."\n\nIt's just as bad as the "I smell weed" excuse... no way to prove it.
> If you move into a new neighborhood and are notified that one of your neighbors is a registered sex offender, are you going to be equally as friendly with them as the other neighbors you don't know yet? \n\nYes, because the majority of 'registered sex offenders' didn't actually commit any sort of violent or egregious sex crime. Most of those people did things like be drunk and pissed in public (even if no one saw his junk) or 17/18 year old males who had consensual sex with their 16/17 year old girlfriend (and they get convicted even if the parents of both 'children' say it's OK.)\n\nYour attitude towards 'those people' is why there is so much recidivism of convicts... they get ostracized and cannot re-integrate back into society. Hard to make friends, hard to get a job, hard to get loans etc etc... all because of one mistake they made possibly decades previous.\n\nI think this cartoon accurately reflects your mentality and how it's wrong, how you don't see the consequence of your attitude towards these kinds of people. [I could be wrong though.](http://2static.fjcdn.com/large/pictures/d5/2e/d52e2c_6129313.jpg)
From my comment there:\n\nSo where do the violations (according to current jurisprudence) occur? The guy voluntarily answered questions and consensually did the FST's without argument... the cops did not overstep their authority when he (finally) stood up for his rights and refused the breathalyzer...\n\nSo other than the checkpoint itself being a violation to the Constitution itself, this guy doesn't quite underatand what a violation of his Rights actually looks like it seems.\n\nYOU GAVE UP ALL YOUR RIGHTS BY ANSWERING QUESTIONS AND CONSENTING TO THE TESTS IN THE FIRST PLACE!﻿\n
