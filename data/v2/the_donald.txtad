n in this case. \nEither Mexico isn't able to police their own citizens properly and now can't get rid of them\n\nOR\n\nThe government personally profits from the cartels and drug trade through America which comes in through the border. \n\nI think the latter is more likely. Either way, they benefit from having an open border.

So the right wing is no longer conservative, Or is being liberal a conservative position now?

He gets his sources from somewhere else... is this guy 5 or something? Should Donald trump investigate every issue by himself? And twitter fights don't matter, hes very transparent, deal with it. Obama said mean things to fox and cited fake statistics and he didnt get impeached.
Listen huhuh right, ben shapiro his thing is like oh OH you thought this was right but you know HEY FUCK YOU, TRYING TO HAVE REASONABLE DISCUSSION. GET OFF THE PHONE
Yeah i should have said it better. Its not like milo is some genius with great principle. He really is a pragmatist and so when he looks at data he makes a conclusion based on the data instead of what the "right thing" to do is. For example an article of his suggested we put a cap on women entering science fields in stem as opposed to forcing an equal amount of men and women into stem. His justification was based on the data that most women don't get jobs in science fields out of stem and drop out at higher rates than men. So instead of saying don't force (the stem program gives priority to girls in the program for science and technology classes at my school) women into stem he thinks there should be a cap on the percentage of women allowed in the program and they should be admitted based on their aptitude for these classes. Obviously this is not principled because women wont have equal opportunity to men all because of data collected on women in stem. I don't like him because he thinks doing what he thinks works is better than defending values like equality of opportunity. Its so easy to take the moral high ground over milo but everyone just calls him inflammatory and a supremacist and every -ist in the book. I hope we can get better conservative provocative or creative speakers, like Andrew klavan and larry elder, but milo is the golden boy right now. I hope bill can debunk his arguments and show that principle can be held over pragmatic views without calling milo a bigot. Hopefully people understand that instead of canceling an appearance you can be civil with people who disagree with you and show people how to argue against them. I wouldn't mind if milo won a debate because at least we can show people that these discussions can take place, but i would prefer if someone could argue with him to change his views from crass and data driven to more moderate and relatable. 
Remember the last time someone demanded beyonce got the award instead of a white girl and the president called him a jackass.

So science would not exist outside of humanity? And we couldn't observe skin color differences if humans never became social creatures or civilized? This person either doesn't know what a social construct is or doesn't understand what science is.

Remember when teen vogue destroyed tucker carlson 
As far as i remember from history class, romans were the only white culture who were infamous for stealing other cultures and technologies and then enslaving their enemies to rebuild their inventions so romans could leverage it in war. They once discovered ships that could be used to assault coasts and land on beaches from Carthage. They killed everyone on the ship and took it to the shipwrights so they could learn to build "warships". They then mass produced these ships and were capable of fighting at the sea. Romans were not engineer geniuses, they just got really good at copying, building, and conquering.

American Sign language is actually adopted from french sign language, but culture is mainly what dictates new signs. Many words have multiple signs and different meanings from the original word its based on. Universal sign language may just be impossible due to how people learn different ways to say one thing and have new unofficial signs based on their culture such as name signs and sports calls and language based jokes/puns (for example a good one is signing "milk" across your face and calling it "pasteurized milk" because its passed your eyes milk XD) etc.
I think a lot of people will gain respect for trump if he sends money to California to fix this mess. Its not the peoples fault that their state government is disobeying the president, and if California cant help them then the federal government needs to step in and get the people what they need.
I was a liberal authoritarian when i was young, then i learned in high school they were not compatible. Now the liberals love authoritarianism and large central government but not when a republican is in office. Now i am more libertarian, john stossel and larry elder showed me the government is bad at everything people can profit from and use. restricting autonomy is only good when your party is in charge. Now New liberalism and libertarianism doesnt work because forced equality of outcome requires federal government intervention and discrimination. Now im economically moderate, slightly libertarian, and socially idk anymore. \n\nGlad you made the transition. Remember, you didn't leave the left, the left left you. They lie and leave you without the full information and make you think the game is rigged, but trust them because they have the solution.
Some people just cant be taught. Sad!
Yes, things that people cant profit from or would be hard to make efficient, like private roads and private law enforcement should be handled by a government, i agree. But do you think a strong federal government is better at managing resources and collecting money than state government? We could just have powerful state governments take money to build high speed rails after all. The federal government just makes things good for the party in power so i would rather have states and cities manage themselves with more freedom than a powerful federal government that screws us over because we gave them too much responsibility and voted the wrong people into power.

Get a lbg that can rapid fire pierce shots and has decent normal 2 capacity (i used the quill burst) and then get attack up on your armor skills (jaggi helm + kutku everything else is what i ran till i got rathalos armor). The flagship monsters have pretty sweet bow guns. I used the mizitsune one and the astalos gun, but kez syringe is probably better. For cutting tails just make the tetsucabra gs and some tetsucabra armor. Once you get the chance, make a bite blaster hbg cuz para shot and normal 2 is super good and much appreciated online to make chains like stun traps para flashes Topples. Also adept dodge is very useful.

The world revolves around me.
The press slanders him every day on any platform they want, how is he authoritarian? Trump also wants people to be able to keep their guns to prevent a police state, how is that authoritarian? Trump wanted to cut funding to Berkeley for rioting in prevention of free speech, how is that authoritarian? Trump is destroying the "deep state" by catching leakers and firing corrupt cia agents who go unchecked by democracy, how is that authoritarian? The public is very capable of forming opinions and opposition when they can protest any platform and not be shut down or report any story they want and not be shut down. Twitter and reddit censor pro trump, alt right, anti media, and anti muslim activity. That is authoritarian. I dont agree with alt right losers and people who demonize all muslims but they should be able to speak freely like anyone else or else we will lose freedom. What happens if the alt right gains control and start censoring moderates and leftists because this generation didnt value freedom? Its not going to be fun when an enemy gains the powers we gave them.
Conservatives are statistically less likely and characteristically less likely to commit crimes and steal, and more likely to donate than liberals. John wright did a paper on this i think.

R+x then two x attacks then a couple of y attacks to finish it the basic combo. Sns is good for elemental and status damage. Use the hunter arts. Round slash is amazing and charges very fast, swords dance cuts parts and applies heavy status damage, shoryu can stun but i prefer absolute readiness. Sns is a very aggressive weapon. Do a combo and then roll away and run back towards the monster is the basic flow of sns. Another good feature is being able to throw bombs and use life powders to help your team out since you dont need to sheath.\nIf you like the aggressive style of sns with its shield to keep you in the action you will probably love the chargeblade so give that a try too.
At the moment the evidence looks thin, so the investigation is going on suspicion. And twitter just a minute ago removed the trend. Maybe it didn't gain enough traction? We will know if this is true eventually.

If this person thinks laws were made historically to control black people... what does that say about how they view blacks? Don't harm others and don't mess with their property are basic law and order. They think these intuitive laws like don't steal from others was made to control black people. Who is the real supremacist here?
Maybe trump is causing these riots with soros money so we don't think hes a globalist pawn!!!!!!!!!!
Lesbian dance theory lmao, you got that from shapiro eh?

That liberals are cucks and shills.
Never really liked milo but he was not someone i hated. I actually thought he was very funny and crude. Then I watched the podcast and saw him argue this position. It was shocking. But i can see why people defend this, it was a year ago and before this campaign for milos character assassination. But you cannot deny he said this on the podcast. Shame these people dont look up the information instead of down voting. Absolutely gross if they think that kids should be able to consent to adults if they are the predator.
Islam is not a race. Its an ideology in need of reform. American muslims are very moderate (only 1/5 believe killing civilians is sometimes or often justified) and reformed. If you let in people from a culture or location that promotes ideologies that are not compatible with yours, then you will make both cultures hate eachother. They have no reason to become part of the culture, they are forced to interact with cultures that dont align with theirs, you have to let people tolerate each other instead of accept each other. My Muslim friends come to america and become Americans. They dont come to be a muslim living with benefits of america and forcing their culture onto others. We communicate and tolerate each other but we dont just blindly accept each others beliefs otherwise we would disagree and hate the other.
I found some dudes on discord and this hr guy grinded with us low ranks up to hr6 in like 4 nights and did the coal charm farm quest with us and taught us how to use cb. He was a cool guy.

But he did defend intergenerational relationships under the circumstances that the child is capable of sexual awareness and consenting. Aka he thinks if the kid says yes then the old guy can get a blowjob. I think he also explained he was the predator when he had his sexual encounter with his priest, so maybe he thinks kids do have sexual maturity but they still dont understand the consequences of the actions and the harm that is brought to the child. While there is little evidence that young boys and older girls engaged in consensual sexual pedophilia causes harm to the child (while man on boy and man on girl do show negative results for their sexuality and self image) it is imposed because the child may be reluctant to say no to someone older/related or in a position of authority like a teacher or an aunt which would make the consent fake.
I laughed way too hard at this
Whats ourjob?
But dont we call white liberals cucks if they like the media or feminism and shills if they like hillary?

Its like the game marbles where you try knock others out of the ring and keep your marble in the ring. In this game the more you hit the other players the more knockback they take which makes it easier to knock them out of the ring.

When you get + or - ten of an armor skill, that skill will be activated. Some skills like attack have multiple levels to apply (+10, 15, 20 or -10, -15, -20) some armor skills are specific or better for some weapons such as the fast charge ability. Fast charge would be useless for insect glaive and horn but amazing on bow and greatsword. Some armor skills can be gem-ed in by decorations. Finally if you need to modify your gameplay you do have a couple of options. Minds eye allows you to hit parts that require higher sharpness without bouncing off. Crag s+ makes any bowgun capable of shooting crag shots. Generally a set will contain 10 points at least to gain the main armor skill. Kiranico is a great source on armor sets and skills.
Reagan coalition covered it
Wait wait wait, why are we alt right now? The alt right hates gay people and hates milo because hes too hard on nationalism.
I read on another sub that most grenade attacks were done by organized crime groups and only recently have grenade attacks from refugees started so the statistic is not majority refugee and immigrants.
I hope he makes milo look dumb so we can stop talking about him and show how to debate provocative people instead of silencing them.
Guess i cant like bands anymore 
Its all an illusion tactic to make us less worried about isis while they plan to double their power! /s
In the gay community they use boy how straight guys use girl. If i said hey check that girl out you wouldn't think I'm talking about some kid. He specified this in his apology. 15 is one year younger than the age of consent which milo agrees with, so he would not advocate for a 15 year old to be in a sexual relationship because they are not sexually mature enough to be in one. When he says younger boy its like saying someone is dating a younger girl, you would assume they are above consenting age but still young.

Something about clarifying the ban, hiring more ICE agents, increased deportations, and I think something was said about beginning construction of the wall.

Okay, it may not be a fair analogy. However, I wasn't comparing human children to animals. When I said 'offspring' I meant fetuses.
I've must missed the part when he does that.. I've watched the movie 3 times and I don't remember him saying such thing. As far as I know [He just never saw his son again after having a fight with him. So throughout the movie, his argument is "Any kid who disrespect his father should get punished", but in the end he realizes that A)this isn't his kid he's punishing, B)he isn't really angry at his son, but at himself.](/spoiler)\n\nI could be wrong, though.

Temporary constructs of a feeble human intellect trying desperately to justify an existence that is without meaning or purpose. And all of them as artificial as the Matrix itself, although... only a human mind could invent something as insipid as love. You must be able to see it, Mr. Anderson. You must know it by now.

I just don't understand why when it's a lion killing an innocent deer or something, we call it 'nature' and 'survival of the fittest', but when it's people doing it to their own offspring, we call it 'murder', even if said offspring will grow up to be 'one of them'.. or 'one of us' who's, if lucky, 'tolerated' by his/her family.
At last. Someone mentions this one. lol

I'm gonna keep my faith in this subreddit by guessing that the possible reason why I got downvoted is that  the information in my comment is too obvious to be discussed. Though I personally wish I found out about this sooner :s

Thank you, but I don't think that will work. I've experienced this behavior with the golden cards since I started playing a long time ago (My PC is old). However, since a few months back, I've been able to see golden portraits as if they were regular ones. But that was until yesterday, when the new patch arrived, I'm afraid. \n\nI just need to get a new computer or hope that Blizzard will undo whatever change they made. Thanks, though :P

No, it's actually 'The Batman series' intro. And I edited that into the question.
Ok. Abortion=Murder. I thought it was obvious what I meant. But tell me, why do you care? From a pragmatic point of view it's the same result: Less numbers for the enemy.
Amazing
Hahahhaha
Hahaha Who would've thought that Jon Lajoie would show up as a 2nd result in google images next to Bill Clinton? Amazing.

But if Summer can't be found in most alternate universes, then there should be even less Mortys across the multiverse considering that he's the younger one. Was Summer aborted in most of those universes? Perhaps she died at birth? Or do Jerry and Beth only meet at a certain point later in life in most universes, making Morty their default first born?
No. That one is really badass but not dark.

Basically what happens is you mine for bitcoins by letting your system analyze other transactions...by doing this, you can earn a share of a bitcoin (this is often done in pools). Transactions can be made from your bitcoin wallet and it's quite simple.

He's pretty staunchly "I don't give a shit". He's said he's for and against it in the past, but he's always made it clear it's not something he'd expend energy fighting. He is absolutely not going to overturn marriage equality. In the campaign he stated he'd leave it to the states if he were to decide, but it's pretty clear it's not on his list of priorities to change.

To be fair according to the article he only recently came out, it's probably more of a case of being awkward and scared of joining a fraternity until he can pass better. Still stupid, but the stupid of rashness not SJWism. 
This is closer to what happened at the debate than what actually did happen. A perfect representation of what it was like to see it happen.\n
No, they're full of shit. Recall the Wikileaks emails that mention Hillary knowing that SA was providing material and logistical support to ISIS. The above quote is a thin excuse.

@PersianLa27 tweeted her drivers license last night and it says Amanda Bynes. Apparently her parents have control of @amandabynes.
Shit, even sterling silver would have been better than what Hillary gave them. It even looked cheesy. She probably personally thought that one up.
They could have just Googled for a picture of any electronic with Russian writing on it. Routers, modems, Furbys... shit, just change the language on your BlackBerry and go to the Reset option, Hillary, OMFG.

She says she's had "model-thin cats" and hated petting them. Wtf is a model-thin cat? This was the most bizarre article. Also, the Pirates of the Caribbean ride made her feel worthless? That really saps away all my hope for humanity.

Well, Sea World did just cancel their whale shows so they probably have some empty tanks.
Did you see their latest commercial? It's set to a song called "Stay With Me," begging somebody to stay. They talk about hiring veterans and how they apparently give to charity. They're scared!! It's working!!
He said, "I am not going to let them, the left side, intimidate me from doing what I feel is the right thing to do for the country and that (presidential) seal." YES, Sam Moore!!
Liberals comparing this to Chinatown and Little Italy are so incredibly glib. I go to Chinatown, I go to Little Italy and I feel welcome. Not only that, but going to a massive Asian grocery store near me, I was the only white person but I didn't feel like an alien. Everyone was super helpful and it was awesome. Fuck liberals comparing these America-hating places with communities of welcoming diversity.
Except she opened with "God Bless America." A right-wing (because it's "God bless," not "Moloch bless") song and a leftist song. And she had red drones light up at "your land" and blue drones light up at "my land" and then had them mix together. AKA telling people to stop burning shit down, start listening to each other and live in peace.

The reddit mods would use it as an excuse to delete T_D because of the child in it. While totally ignoring that Hillary was in the photo and the implications of that. Calling it now.
I'm really starting to believe that FWD: Fwd: Fwd: Fwd: shit my dad sent me 8 years ago about Obama being the antichrist.
It's true. I'm a moderately successful woman, I suppose, and I can attest that women's egos go primarily into jewelry, clothes, shoes, fancy restaurants and interior design, not cars. A car above $60k just seems to be a waste to people who don't care about horsepower, handling at top speeds and [insert other car jargon.] Just give me my heated leather seats, nice sound system and some burl wood detail and I'm sold. A $120k car is definitely not bought without a guy calling the shots. Unless you're Danica Patrick.
I just saw something on Cuckbook about how Anonymous took down tons of pizza-related websites today. Is this bad for the FBI as it disconnects their leads? It gave me a really bad feeling.
Yes - we voted him in because he will always listen to what the people want and work to get it done. If he solves the Flint water crisis, maybe his message will spread.
She needs her fragile snowflakes to think they are in Dumbledore's Army for real so they *never* grow up and keeping reading her books and watching her movies!
After Beyoncé brought out the Black Panthers last year? 
Last two sentences lead me to believe that maybe, just maybe, he is giving the signal to the FBI to re-open the Clinton case and Lock. Her. Up.
Yeah, that's where it came from. She was friends with Perez Hilton for a while too and he's just fucking terrible enough to leak it to the press rather than get her help.\n\nEDIT: Perez also has children that are apparently his, but no one seems to know where they came from. Does he know Alefantis?
He's about to get 5150'd and he doesn't even know it yet.
The funny thing is that other planets with water in their makeup are warming too. But it couldn't possibly be a major solar event because that would make the masses panic. Better say it's our manufacturing emissions that's causing it. Because that's why Mars and Pluto are warming at the same rate Earth is. Did they stop teaching correlation and causation at liberal universities or some shit?
Multi-hyphenate? Large stage performances?
Blind Gossip vets like crazy. They don't publish without solid sources.
Found Bart's Reddit account.
People in Hollywood have known about Dan Schneider being a pedo for years, and some people have known specifically about her abortion. Also, her mental instability and her symptoms are pretty much textbook for someone who's been a victim of severe childhood trauma. Also, read her tweets and see the picture of her driver's license she posted.
Can we just take a second to address those celebrities' ridiculous racist claims? \n\nIf white Nazi terrorists were using a refugee crisis as a means to get into countries they hate to bomb them, would I still say we need extreme vetting and to keep them out until we do? Abso-fucking-lutely. \n\nIf the country to the south of us was 100% white and white criminals hopped the border to evade punishment and white people were coming here illegally to take advantage of government aid and take minimum wage jobs without following the correct legal process, would I still say build the wall? Abso-fucking-lutely.
When pg breaks, leftists are going to be like Fudge at the end of Order of the Phoenix. Shocked as all hell.
This also explains Cuck Schumer's crocodile tears. Need them minority votes!! 🐊😭
It's not an uncommon fear for people that grew up in fucked up satanic cults or had ritual abuse happen to them to have fears of the dentist. Not sure what the connection is, but a social worker/psychologist friend told me that.
Her abuser's name is Dan Schneider and apparently the abortion thing has been an open secret in Hollywood for years.
Yes - those lines are key. I went to the World Meeting of Families in Philadelphia last year. Security was so multilayered, it is almost impossible to believe. You had people in line to get into the secure area at every street with lines HOURS long, unable to get anywhere near the ceremonies. You had people on the other side of the street from the Art Museum stage (keep in mind this is AFTER having gone through security), crying and holding their tickets to the seated areas up for the police and Secret Service to please let them over to their seats. They said they'd let people through, but didn't because there was a chance the motorcade would be early (they weren't.) I am grateful to the people who keep our Pope and President safe, but no thought is put into logistics to get where you need to be once you're in the secure area and there were not enough bag checkers and guards and checkpoints. Looking at the long lines to get in makes me so sad because I know how disappointed those pedes must have been. I think a lot of people coming in from out of town would especially not expect the long lines. 
Dunkin' Donuts IS better coffee. Only basic bougie bitches really like Starbucks.
Break that glass ceiling, Marine! Let's improve upon Hillary's failed slogan: Elle est avec vous! #sheswithyou
I still keep asking myself: where was the outrage and merchandise saying "Nasty Guy" from liberals when Trump called Ted a nasty guy? Oh that's right, identity politics and all that.
Send him to Gitmo with the rest of the terrorists for his death row.
YES! I knew I loved based Wegmans for a reason.

And I read some article from a marketing guru who said the #imwithher slogan subconsciously made people think of the word "wither."\n\nEdit: /u/commander_kek posted the article!
HA! Weinstein is one of the worst offenders for taking advantage of young actresses. Barry let her go work for him? Wow.

It did! Up .5%, but still a boost!
Why the fuck does he have fangs?
Damn. A lot of those women in the first pic are still alive. Imagine what they must feel. Probably the opposite of what suffragettes felt after women got the right to vote. If those idiot leftists like Katy Perry really gave a shit about women's rights at all, they'd be here, fighting for these women.
I mean, if it WAS fake and someone believed a conspiracy about me, I would think they are absolutely unhinged and just ignore it. The fact that she tweeted this is so very cocky and so very telling. Perfect example: when my friend's younger brother said his former best friends "deserve bad karma", because they blew the whistle on him doing drugs in the bathroom. Wasn't exactly a surprise when we eventually found out he WAS doing drugs in the bathroom...
Why do they keep calling it a world order? They're not even denying it! Why not a synonym with less connotation? God, these people are arrogant.
He's saluting Lincoln! ...I'm not crying, you're crying!! Who is cutting onions in here?

I literally think he is grown-up Bat Boy.
Macaulay's friend MJ knew all about the pedophiliac cult shit. That's why they tried to paint him as one. But if you hear his last phone call before he died, it disproves that. He was also apparently going to expose them all on a video montage on his final tour. Couldn't have that happen, so he got suicided/propofoled.
To any Trump team members reading these comments, I'm so sorry for what this paper did to you only to come around in the end. It shows they knew it was wrong all along. It's truly unfair what you guys have had to go through. 
She forgot the fact that Donald Duck is a beloved character from everyone's childhood. She is terrible (great?) at doing things that subconsciously make The Don look more appealing. Probably because she can't help herself but subconsciously want to keep kissing his ass because he's rich like she used to.
Can Milo be the Weasley twins to Hillary's Umbridge?
Sadly, they have no such self-awareness. Everyone's a Democrat until they hit about 30 (except Generation Z, which is apparently already based as fuck). They'll all say they loved Trump. My bra-burning aunt now says she thought even Nixon was a great President and is a staunch Trump supporter. Grateful to have her support, but if you think these protesting liberals will ever admit they were wrong, that's a mistake. And the ones that never grow out of liberalism, well... may God have mercy on their souls.
Villanova!
It's Anime Trump! ✨
B-b-but Hillary said he supported Trump and that Trump would run the US like he runs North Korea!
They're always on the money, it's kind of my guilty pleasure to read it. But proof? Some girl hacked into Miley Cyrus's iCloud and had all her emails a few years ago. She went back and forth with BG about some Liam bombshell and they wouldn't publish anything because she couldn't provide the headers proving they were genuine. Kind of a stupid example, but shows they do vet their sources.
Didn't the FBI leak documents proving his father and he had had security clearance for a very long time? I remember reading he went to the secret NWO cult club in CA (the something Grove?) way back when and they didn't like him being there. Maybe he went to gather intel. 
She had "your land" light up half the sky red and "my land" light up the other half blue and then had the colors mixing. It was a message of unity - to stop burning shit down, listen to each other and live in peace.
Can we meme Kim Jong Un into offering leftists citizenship under the guise of freedom from Trump?
And a starring role on SNL. You can even call your own daughter a pig and no one will care as long as you criticize Trump!

I love BG! They also broke the news about Hillary being a drunken psychopath on Election Night and that it wasn't true that singers were saying no to Trump for the Inauguration concert, so they're obviously based af.
That's what I thought too. Sabotage.
The mean man behind the counter! I can't.
I love this man.
I don't think the original quote had the word fascist in it. Because HRC knows the Don isn't really a fascist; she just made it up about him because she's literally Regina George.
I like how it shows the rest of the world as voting for Barry.
Grown up Bat Boy!
Yes! I was proud to Pokémon Go to the polls and vote for TRUMP!
My cousin's daughter is Gen Z (born two weeks before 9/11) and she is based as fuck. Chanting "Lock her up!" with her friends at the beach this summer watching the DNC. My boss's son is 12 and already knows about Trump fighting the NWO. I'm all for you guys being the next Greatest Generation! And as a Millennial, please let me in as an honorary member?
Did you see the Katie Couric piece on gender? There was a based old lady (formerly a man) at the end who said TO AN SJW that she loves pink and girly things and she fought hard to be a woman. She said all of this nonsense about the non-binary unicorn genderism is a disgrace. She was crying in shame at the foolishness the SJW was spouting.
As a lesbian, this is hysterical.

Gizmodo is a fucking joke. Ever since that guy leaked the iPhone 4 and his house got raided it's been run by shills.
Interesting he says "the perverts" instead of just "perverts." It's almost as if he knows who the group is that's committing these atrocities! Hmm... 
"Is it working?" I exclaim.
This is scary. She might actually incite some psychopath to hurt President Trump. Please someone tell me they reported her to the FBI and Secret Service.
Man, Japan is so based. I always hear about their low crime statistics, high average personal wealth and super fun technology and always wished America could be a little more like them. I'm so glad DJT obviously thought so too!

I made the mistake of reading comments on YouTube for an olberman video where he says Trump is going to set up concentration camps. It's one of the top videos. These snowflakes actually  believe him. Every single comment is Trump is hitler. These people are incredibly stupid and brainwashed. It's amazing 
Had a talk with a top GOP senators son yesterday. And he said "don't let his act fool you, Trump is the smartest person in the room." He said a big part of his strategy is to have folks under estimate him

Of course they are--- they think he is hitler and they are sore losers
Love this guy
This screams of fake news
Just read that UN ambassador Nikki Haley condemns Russia's aggression today.  Mehhh Russians Naritive shattered 
Unbelievable --- the wall just got ten feet higher
My boycott list has gotten longer tonight... F these companies 
This isn't good. When something like this happens it just supports the chaos narritive. I feel for his team, this media and libs onslaught is unlike anything any administration has ever faced. I feel like this is like in a football game.. you gotta weather the first punches and settle down and work the game plan. Trump is smart and his team knows how to win. I know I'm praying for them nonstop 
WEW lads that should get the media stirred enough to go get the pedos without them looking
Cucked commercials everywhere 
Lol just saw a huff po link go by on twitter that said "unnamed sources" say trump called gen Flynn at 3 in the morning to ask if a strong dollar is good for the country... they are just making shit up st this point.
Weh lads she's the main headline on drudge .... talk about exposure 
THIS
I hate the media so f'n much... the damage has been done...
The exit polls are saying ATL has this
In front of Jackson LOL triggered!!!
I got off of twitter and Facebook .... life is grand.  Think about what Trump is trying to do and the enemy he is fighting. The media, the establishment--- it was never going to be easy. He is also having to learn on the job about the insane  bureaucracy. The greatest generation were remembered for their fight and resolve --- this is our chance to fight a different battle but one of the same level of consequence. So stay strong pedes. Buckle up for the long haul. There will be ups and down but I'm convinced we will win bigly. My kids future is at stake.
So much winning ---
Where are you seeing that she is going to do this? It will backfire - they still don't get that We the people wanted Trump.

Tired of being nice.... I'm on the redpoll warpath today and I don't care if I lose friends etc. 
Yep this doesn't give me warm and fuzzies

I love how Trump fights back.... you leak crap about him and your past lies are headline news the next day 
Remember when Trump had no chance to come back and win
They are usually pretty based too
lol I was called a fascist today by someone that overheard a conversation I was having about politics. I then asked (random stranger that knows nothing about me)  them to define the word fascist ---- "a fascist is a Trump supporter"  WEW lads the ignorance is at high levels 
Chilling on Sunday afternoon dreaming of four bricks
Seriously what's wrong with that guy... he is mental 
Never seen a team that far to the left on an extra kick. Looked off from the start
I see the new talking point is "republicans will break away from trump by the summer" 
Between the Gay editor that came out as based and the Grammy dress made by a gay immigrant worn by a minority today has smashed narratives and hopefully redpilling  many. A good day. 
I agree was listening to sports talk and they were talking about espn making the pro trump quote by under armor president into this scandal. People were calling in from all over the country red pilled and sick of it
Those two hate Trump and are cucks.... 
This reminds me of the time when a black singer when to the German music awards to suport literally hitler

So this is buried in a recent CNN story\nAccording to an excerpt of the transcript of the call with Peña Nieto provided to CNN, Trump said, "You have some pretty tough hombres in Mexico that you may need help with. We are willing to help with that big-league, but they have be knocked out and you have not done a good job knocking them out." Trump made an offer to help Peña Nieto with the drug cartels. The excerpt of the transcript obtained by CNN differs with an official internal readout of the call that wrongly suggested Trump was contemplating sending troops to the border in a hostile way.\nBut all afternoon f'n Drudge of all people had "Trump Threatens Troops Into Mexico" The media is going to cause a literal civil wars.

 Thing about Meyers is, he's after Jimmy Fallon at 12.30. So basically enough people fall asleep to generate him a good enough rating, but it'S 12.30, no one really cares. Plus, at least he has a personal beef with the Don, makes it SOMEWHAT more tolerable.
 thanks man. it's gonna be election night all over again but with less stress :D

 CTR is strong on every tweet he sends. Annoys me. 
 but we can definitely see the popular vote crawling up every day, even a week after an election. nobody else finds this annoying?
but what is the method they're using? cabinet confirmations need a simple majority vote.
 Yeah but the rest of them are cable channels. THe four networks are ABC, CBS, NBC and FOX.
 I'm pretty sure other countries have their own news channels tho

I'm so glad he's getting such a huge amount of support after this, I was afraid that the Regressive might've finally found a way to divide us. He's gonna be stronger, he already is, and so are we.\n\nOld media's lifesigns are fading fast, this is just their death rattle 💀
Ikr??? Flippin' off the globalists 🇺🇸✨✨✨
I'd ask simply for the sake of knowing, even though the picture is perfectly clear. It's just nice to know for some reason. Also I'm a bit of a linguaphile in general!
I worked on chicken farms and also picked fruit and veggies just out of high school. It was hard but honest work, and it paid well, in Australia at least. Tell me why these jobs are so horrible that us "whiteys" can't handle the thought of doing them? Call me weird, but I actually enjoyed the hell out of them, I like time to myself in the company of animals/plants. MUCH better than all the crappy service jobs I've had combined. It's sad really, that it's so easy to fall for the lie that the service industry is far less demeaning than blue-collar work.
Step G: GET WOKE
Amen to all of this. Christianity/Judaism isn't Islam, God never wanted us to forcefully impose our belief system onto others. We're simply meant to be the best example to others that we can be, and follow His rules ourselves (full disclosure, Messianic Karaite Jew here). Of course, things like murder and rape and theft and slavery and you know, OBVIOUS infringements on the well-being and rights of others shouldn't be ignored. But that's a pretty universally accepted truth in western Judeo-Christian based society already. Some people just need to chill, and learn to choose their battles.
Brand new subscriber, reporting for duty! Just tell me where to shovel all that clean, American coal.
Oh god the song choice I'm dying this is so amazing ;__;
A similar thing happened to me, I've never used Twitter before but wanted to sign up just to follow a number of accounts mentioned on T_D. Didn't make one single tweet, followed maybe 10 conservative accounts including the President's.... Suddenly bam. Locked for "suspicious activities."
I'm pretty sure President Trump is very supportive of birth control. As in, aiming for over-the-counter availability. And also I've heard he's interested in lowering the cost/regulations surrounding adoptions too. I'd always seen these as much better options than en-masse abortions myself, so I was incredibly relieved to hear he shared the same views. I'm a Messianic Jew, so in my personal life I would never ever consider getting an abortion, and would advocate celibacy when it came to my own children, but as far as the larger societal issue is concerned, OTC birth control is a no-brainer if it prevented the destruction of human life.\n\nI have a couple of issues with your argument, one is that you say childbirth "wrecks" a woman's body. That's a bit hyperbolic. It changes a body, sure, and maybe to a lesser standard of "beauty", but except in the case of severe complications, wreck it it does not. My second problem is the whole "a woman can do what she wants with her body" line. In my opinion it's the most insidious if all the pro-choice arguments, because it lowers human life to the level of a mere clump of cells. I honestly don't think an embryo with 50% of its DNA from another human is truly "her body" anymore, and so the decision should remain much more serious than simply... excising a tumorous growth, for example. It shouldn't be lightly written off as such.\n\nBut yeah, I'm feeling like we're pretty much on the same page outcome-wise, and if those two solutions could be implemented, I have a feeling a lot of people would be very, very happy!
My problem isn't your beliefs or anyone else's, I hope you don't think that. My issue is with the saying itself; it's clever on the surface, but to try to state empirically that "they both believe in something they haven't experienced and don't know" is a false assumption on a believer's behalf. It dismisses off-hand the personal experience and evidence of many.\n\nAnd to try to clarify your reasoning with the use of the word "belief" itself: is it truly necessary that I should alter my English, rephrase my faith/belief in God as a "remembered understanding"? To use Trump as a living, present-day example, should I no longer say I have faith in Trump? Should I refrain from saying I believe in him? Should I instead say: "I remember and understand Trump" because that somehow makes it all clearer? I'm not really sure that's necessary, myself.
They exist. I may have just lost a really good friend because I brought up "manufactured fear and hate" in response to the Berkeley riots on my own IG account, and she attempted to call me out on posting about it. She refuses to believe that the media paints a majorly negative picture of the President. Even when shown articles listing widespread instances of anti-Trump bias, as well as a list of ways the previous administration oppressed dissenting journalists, which in turn causes the environment we have today. And on top of that I sent links to the "hidden" photos of the riot here on T_D that the MSM will never show. So yep. They exist. And they tend to resort to taking cover behind emotions and feelings too, which makes it so painful to try to argue reason with them. Especially if you care for them a lot. :(
I'm fairly certain the comment above mine was referencing Muslims, I know Sweden allows alcohol but Muslims take offence to that and attempt to impose Sharia law even where it has no legal standing yet.
Yeahhh I don't think distancing ourselves from someone who *suffered through being a pedophilia victim* is a smart or fair decision. So he worded something poorly. He says a lot of inflammatory stuff. He may not be the best choice for occasions where austerity is important, but to distance ourselves from him?? That's uncalled for. Dividing us is *literally* what they want. 
I've been quietly chuckling at the fact that the Don is a LOT less orange now than he used to be last year..... so many layers of trolling, just so nobody would take him seriously, it's truly a thing of beauty.
Anyone else think it's time to start taking this knowledge battle -- needs a catchier title..... Like an "Infowar" or something ;) -- to the streets? I'm not necessarily talking about huge rallies, at least not in the trying-to-catch-media-attention way. We're simply getting more and more censored and filtered online, so I personally feel it might be about time for a concerted effort at disseminating printouts, stickers, business cards with URLs, crowdsourcing some printable grassroots zines and newsletters.... basically I think we need to get out there en masse and nail some treatises to some damn doors. \n\nWe don't have to redpill everyone. Just reach out to the people who have never been allowed see the facts behind some of these issues through their typical news channels. Sweden, Paris, the true cost/impact of illegal immigration in the US, the hypocrisy of Antifa, the way that members of classical Dem voter blocks are vilified and attacked by their own politicians and journalists if they "wander off the plantation". Heck, that infographic that was on here this week about Obama's crimes against the US could easily be printed out and taped up somewhere. We have SO MUCH material here, and it begs to be shared. Idk if Reddit would kill T_D for "brigading irl" lol, but we could include URLs and/or QR codes to this forum or else another more neutral site that may link here in its own content.\n\nSo, uh... what do y'all say? 🇺🇸
Dang you got downvoted hard for that, just letting you know I agree. He fully admitted during his press conference statement that he had been coming to terms with his problems the last few years and that there were a couple of his own points he no longer agreed with AND that he wouldn't want to phrase his words like that again. So yeah idk why people would downvote you so much for being sympathetic to his plight, as well as his attempts to fix it :/
Ah wow yeah that summarizes my run-in with a really good friend, I was venting publicly online about how people need to make sure for themselves that it's Trump that they don't like, and not some false fear/hate the MSM was manufacturing in their stead, I wasn't even going pro-Trump, I was only asking the world in general what he'd done that was so horrible to justify the violent Berkeley riots. She comes at me and we get in a huge argument, and finally at the end she revealed that she took offense to me insinuating that she was stupid for believing the media's "so-called lies". Which I wasn't trying to do, never called her dumb or stupid or ignorant or anything, like I didn't even realise that she could take me linking to articles and facts that way until she said it, which shows how little I was trying to insinuate anything.\n\nGood lord do they have a lot of pride tied up in all this or what :(
I love that original article so much, just for the honest, heart-on-sleeve stupidity of it all. Caitlyn Jenner is amazingly based, and this writer LETS her opinions be there, for everyone else to see. Then the writer simply says...... I don't get it. I'm not thoughtful enough to understand. She allows Caitlyn to call her out on the incessant harping on L.G.B.T. issues over all else, immortalizes it in writing, admits she "hits her with a newspaper" when she's not getting the right response.....  People like this honestly do our job for us. I'm hoping that a lot of LGBT people that are on the fence read this and realise that Caitlyn is making a hell of a lot more sense, and knows more about the state of the US, than the writer herself.
I'm also fairly willing to bet that she's going to pass away rather soon, from her "mystery" illness *cough kuru cough*.... Who knows what kind of mess that would have given them reason to cause :/
This is so true. Idk I haven't been so well read, getting better about that recently, but even I could figure this out long ago. There's nothing wrong with women in the workplace, but this massive push to guilt us ladies into feeling like we have to be working, mothering, chore-doing, don't-need-no-man superheroes just exhausted us all as people tbh. No wonder feminists are so on edge. And yep also tore open our families to the influences of governmental/media surrogate "parents". I get so sad thinking about how many children have missed out on a good family life because of overworked mothers. Not to mention they vote Dem/big gov because they desperately need something to cling to emotionally, something to put bandaids on their boo-boos. Sigh.
I always forget about their no alcohol laws, damn what will all those campus SJWs barf into their same-sex toilets now?? #savethesnowflakes

Can I ask why? I knew I hadn't noticed her around much for a while, but didn't hear any goings-on.
Japan definitely has that issue, because of the necessity and prevalence of IMEs on cell phones and computers. Many can recognise kanji from an autocomplete list but not necessarily write them off the top of their head. If I were to take up Japanese again I'd probably ignore learning to write them too tbh, I wasted a lot of time obsessing over them 😅

"Do you think I'd tell YOU about what I'm gonna do in North Korea? What I'm gonna do in Iran?" I laughed so hard. Is he signalling? Is he joking? Is he.... The Grand Master Baiter??\n\nFeast on that tenth dimensional trolling, you MSM twats 🐸🇺🇸
Exactly what I was wanting to comment. I mean, HOW can they not see their own hypocrisy? How many times has Cartman openly praised Hitler and the death of Jews?? It's satire. It's commentary. But not when PewDiePie does it?? These..... jfc these people.
Scum of the earth. Scourge of the entire fucking planet. How many countries have you  collapsed, Soros? How many lives have you destroyed? You will have to answer for *every, single, one*, if not in this life then in the next. Curse your name and the very ground you walk on.
It really is pathetic :'( A warm welcome to the eye of the censorship shitstorm, friend.
I said enough is enough after Bezerkley and ranted on my Instagram art account's Story about the MSM manufacturing fear and hate, lost my literal best friend on there..... Does that count? 😅\n\nBut no seriously, this is great advice for everyone. I had a LOT of people DM me and say "thanks for saying that." Even some from the Democrat side of the fence. So many people feel afraid and alone in the world atm, thinking they're the only pro-Trump people in their social circles, because nobody else is speaking up. One kid even said "I'm still young so I haven't had a chance to think about a lot of this stuff, but you really opened my eyes". Seriously. For every shitlib that rips into you, there will be a lot of "silent watchers" on the edges, possibly wondering if what you're talking about could actually be true. And that's all it takes. That's the best thing we can do right now.
Pfft. We ARE free to do what we want, INCLUDING taking advice from an invisible sky wizard man. That's our choice, my friend, no-one is forcing us to submit to it.\n\nOr mutilating our genitals.
Nah man, nah. My husband's circumsised. It doesn't cause him pain, or to lose pleasure or perform any worse (trust me on this 😉). You cannot possibly equate FGM with male circumcision. It's just not even in the same universe, let alone league. Here's a link to the effects of FGM..... http://www.who.int/reproductivehealth/topics/fgm/health_consequences_fgm/en/\n\nJust *try* to convince me that male circumcision causes anything other than the loss of a foreskin in the overwhelming majority of cases. The procedure is very common in the US at least, and complications are incredibly rare. FGM almost guarantees complications of some sort. You know what MIGHT be more equal? Having your penis flensed and your peehole sewn mostly shut. Think about that.
Well not many folks knew anything about the Bowling Green story and now it is common knowledge. I'd say that it was a pretty successful tactic to get people talking about it.
I think in addition to the usual school/media brainwashing, they've also been played by the RINOs, which put the final nail in their blind faith that "hey, the Progressives at least has a heart". (which no, they really don't, I know.) Heck we all have been in some fashion, otherwise why would they even be in office.\n\nHypocrites do more damage to their own religion than atheists ever could, and the same goes for politics.\n
I understand where you're coming from, and I know you're not specifically arguing against God's existence, but how can you definitively prove people haven't experienced God? Can you prove that Moses didn't? Or Abraham, or Jesus?\n\nI believe I've experienced God, I may not be able to prove it to you, but it can't be proven that I haven't, either. I'd also say I know God pretty well too, through His scriptures. There's a lot of history and fulfilled prophecy in there.\n\nNot saying this to be argumentative, I just feel that saying is a little exclusive of a lot of people's personal experiences. Some may follow blindly because their parents and community do, but others like myself tend to look for reason, signs, and proof. 
Wow he really did..... hmmmmmmmmmm\nhttps://mobile.twitter.com/pewdiepie/status/833436309419069441\n\nEdit: AND a hat. Kek
I'm brand new to Reddit posting so I'm sorry if this one isn't done right but I just got so steamed up when I got this email from Meetup this afternoon. They can't even wait for the #resist movement to make their own meetups, so they've created their own network nationwide it seems. These people protesting Trump must reeeeeaaallly be motivated for them to have to wait to be force-fed rallies, I tell ya what. The "For Democracy" banner at the top also revolves to other versions of the "for ........" phrase: for refugees, women's rights, sustainability, education, equality, healthcare, etc..... \n\nUsing that hashtag is basically advocating political unrest in my books, and wrongfully implying that President Trump's administration doesn't give a shit about any of these issues. I hope to god they haven't started silencing pro-Trump groups as well.\n\nTired of this.
They've had excellent foresight with their city planning around here, lots of tracts saved for roadways, but construction just can't keep up with the sheer pace of growth atm. If the economy hadn't tanked so hard in 2008 and everyone hadn't had to mass-migrate to find work it may have stayed a little slower and more manageable lol
Oh my gosh I'm in the exact same boat -- I mean, I haven't actually started the process but I've been in the US for 9 years now as a legal resident married to a citizen, and Obama was the only administration I've ever known (we flew back I think the day after he was inaugurated) so I couldn't pledge my allegiance to such a messed up government ;_; I'm still so scared for Trump's safety right now but yes, I think it might be about time I did this myself. Thanks for sharing your story, and being an inspiration!
Exactly. 🇺🇸✨ Keep fighting the good fight friend!
I believe that certain women in power, when they aren't making the entire thing simply about women, are great. But yeah I'm a woman and I know that the male and female brains go about things in fairly different ways. Women DO have strengths in incredibly important areas, like community, charity, empathy, family etc.... But when you try to apply them to government thinking they're somehow the only/better answer, and take away the more "masculine" elements of autonomy and fighting for one's own individual standing that you end up with literal socialism.\n\nSo a good female politician needs to know that it's NOT about feminism or making everything fit some "female way." It's about countries and making sure that government runs right firstly for the workers who make money to take care of their families (mostly males, no way around that). Then and only then will that stability carry over into all other areas of society.
This is honestly the best show I've ever seen in my life, by far. Okay well The Expanse has been pretty dang good but I literally can't pay attention to anything else right now, such drama o.o
I put on my robe and wizard hat
He IS working, he apparently only sleeps four hours a night, he's constantly meeting with foreign leaders as well as domestic industry leaders, signing EOs, working with Congress to repeal Obamacare and fix the tax code, wrestling the Senate to get his full cabinet confirmed, he's gotten so much done in his first month.... I'm not sure if I can explain it to you if you can't see it already, but he IS working. Constantly. The operative word in the complaint that you quoted of him is "INSTEAD". Trump is doing BOTH.\n\nAnd besides, my own answer to your original posted question is that his constituents are badly needing him to speak in person right now, because his words and his image are getting so badly trampled by an antagonistic media. This is the best way for him to get his word out, as well as connecting to the people he serves. It's so easy to get disheartened when the media is raining vitriol on the leader you elected, spreading false and misleading news with "unnamed sources"...... He needs to do this simply to keep the country united. Not to win the next election. IMHO, he's got that packed away tidily in the bag already.\n\nI'm taking a random guess that the rally took maybe less than two hours out of his schedule, with flight time and then the speech itself. On a SATURDAY. His constituency needed this. He works his ass off, and still you're saying "I'm hoping he would do better."\n\nWe the people are his single largest support base. He doesn't have the media or globalists or the monopolistic multinationals which profit off illegal immigration, hell he doesn't even really have the intelligence community, for god's sake. I really, really don't see the problem with him visiting us and repeating his promises, as well as providing updates straight from the horse's mouth.
This guy absolutely was being a dick, but she took the bait and lost her cool and that's ultimately why that shit went down. It has nothing to do with fear, I'm not scared of cops if I'm not doing anything wrong, but you bet your ass I'm not going to scream or curse at them..ever. It's just not smart. Shit like this happens lol.

Personally, I don't have a "favorite player" in smash, I would just rather see literally any other player get in. In a true popular vote he'd most likely be dead last, that's why people are angry. And what has he done to get these votes? What kind of campaigning has he been doing? We've got guys out here streaming their asses off, rapping, offering all kinds of voting incentives, doing AMAs (with people kind enough to take time out of their day to translate japanese), and eating fucking onions to get votes. But fuck me, I'm just being dumb and looking for a scapegoat..bitch, please.
This. I follow melee pretty closely and have just straight up never heard of some of the other folks listed..I mean c'mon DF was in the running to get to summit..
I also think flying cars are a terrible idea.. considering the fact that anything that flies is clearly not a car, and is an airplane. Except for bees, they aren't airplanes...I think.
There is no "Muslim ban". Unsubbed.
Did you guys break up because you use words like squanched?
>police said the attack was not reported\n\nGuys..
I'm relieved that Leffen apparently was not the reason for the delay, but I think it's still a bad move to drop out of crews like that. There is not one single logical reason anyone can give to excuse Leffen from contacting whoever was in charge to make sure he was not drafted for crews if he had no interest in being in them. If he signed up for the event, he should know what the fuck is going on. Honestly, I just feel bad for anyone who donated for crews..this is just a big middle finger to those particular fans. I love watching Leffen play, as I'm sure most of you do, love him or hate him..but he's definitely being a fuccboi right now and you can't deny that. Oh and Armada dropped, so fuck him too.
Beautiful!

Give it a rest, no one cares. This is the dumbest post I have seen on this sub.
The fact that you can afford to have 367 steam games depresses me. Do something more productive with your money and stop buying awful games like watchdogs.
If you don't care about being able to light shield with that trigger, try it with no spring, you might like it. I think trimming the spring is a pretty viable option as well.
Uhhh how did you get on r/sweden? It won't let me go there.
You're absolutely right. We should spend less time pointing fingers and more time exposing the shenanigans of taking people out of context. Really sad that you got down voted so hard.
Bottom line, they gotta make that money. The voting system we have currently seems to do a very good job of that. It's really frustrating that the fans with the most disposable income have the most influence, but that's how the world works in general. A true popular vote would be incredible.. sadly it will never happen. Also worth noting EU fans get a bit screwed because of shipping costs. I'm going to lose my fucking mind if Ice doesn't get in, especially since Android dropped out to help his chances. Classy move.
Dude, I hate to break it to you, but if anyone that knows you IRL read that, they DEFINITELY know this is you. Not many people have a relative die and travel around the world for 6 months. Or this is all completely made up, the more logical answer.
You may be responding to a shill. That is an absurd stance for a normal person to have.
Do you also think people have a right to drive no matter what too? Newsflash, you don't have that right. Everyone has to go through the system and I feel like voter registration is common knowledge for most people over the age of 16.
Hahaha god..classic Troi

Completely disagree. Chess (especially in tight time controls) is all about hitting your "soft zone" and being able to make your ideas flow in the exact same way they do in tennis in melee.

I would be a little hesitant to attribute their accomplishments to "being a special kind of genius" because it slightly undermines the insane amount of work they have to put in, regardless of any sort of natural talent they may possess.
SHUT UP, WESLEY.
>Perhaps the people who decide to smoke earlier are not as smart as those who don't smoke until later in life.\n\nCame here to say this. From my experience, the kids in my school that were able to get access to pot and other drugs at such a young age were also living in poorer areas, clearly had less educated parents, and weren't straight A students to begin with.
You are absolutely delusional if you think that he would be "pretty high up" if every melee fan in the world could vote and have equal representation. My. Fucking. Sides.
Lol I hope that down voting was very informative, what a nice community!
Are you sure you are online?  I know i went until the 3-4th area without using one, and only did some co-op to farm a few levels, then went to use one and found i had 30+.\n
I don't think it was meant to be insulting, but you can choose to take it that way I guess, lol. His point is there is an insanely huge variety of skill levels in chess. It's one of the most epic things about it and the main reason I push myself to be the best I can be. Having a fragile ego certainly won't help in your development. Everyone here knows you have to suck for a little while before you git gud. I should know, I'm fucking terrible XD

My point is no matter what Russia did or did not do when it comes to 'hacking' they did not hack voting machines.  They did not send in thousands of Russians to vote illegally.  The wikileaks hack did nothing but show what was happening behind the curtain of the DNC, how bias it was against bernie, and the thought process behind its decisions along with its honest (In their own words) presentation of what they thought.  While yes in a perfect world this could be considered unfair play, its not less valid a tactic than digging in peoples pasts and bringing up a 16 year old conversation with no evidence it actually meant anything but arrogant bragging or sneaking people into other candidates rallies and trying to cause violence to make them look bad.  The difference here is that all it did was make the Democratic voters see how they were being manipulated (Especially the Bernie supporters) and an honest look at what the Hillary camp actually thought of them.  They were hung by their own rope.  Not a single email released by wikileaks has been disputed as being a lie or false claim because its real.   \nI posted the third article because it was old.  I wanted an older - pre Trump win example to prove it existed before.  \n\nLook, I was not really eager about Trump being the Nominee.  I did not expect his win, but he did win, and trying to cheapen it with misleading statements such as 'Russia hacked the election' (which is completely false because it suggests Russia hacked voting machines) are just childish and petty.  I'm also 'overly hostile' because of an environment produced by the Democrats and Liberals that automatically labels me as a Racist and Facist just because I don't agree with them.  I've been actively censored on these and other boards because I'm giving my support behind a legally elected president.

Well what about a situation like the mentioned, meeting someone you like that makes your heart pound a little harder.  its not like your breathing heavier, you just raised your anxiety.  would that also make you pass out if the anxiety that normally would raise your pressure or increase your heart rate didnt have an 'out' like breathing heavy to support it?\n

Nothing.  This is purely an attempt to discredit anything he does.

 Got news for you sir or ma'am or <insert gender here>, the 'popular vote' thing is a fantasy.  They didnt change the rules just for him.  The electorial College is what decides it and has for a very long time.  It's not like he 'stole' the election.  Every Candidate knows they need to control these certain states, and Hillary ignored that.  One state does not decide the election.\n

Zootopia was good, not going to complain about it, but it also was fairly standard.  Kubo to me felt like a SLIGHTLY- americanized version of a Japanese folktale and It told the story beautifully.  I've been a fan of Usagi Yojimbo Comics since i was a kid, and this really felt similar in many ways.  I only say slightly Americanized because it was a bit more happy in some spots than much of Japanese stories of this kind, so it retained the tragedy of the story, but ended on an upbeat note.  \n\nAlso, the animatronics involved in using puppets along with the CGI was amazing work.  After i watched it for the first time i was stunned by how wonderfully the whole thing came together.  
Silly question.  when you respec, do you lose all your skills and magic and as you reapply points regain skill points and magic points to invest again?

In Canada you can be PM with less than 30% of the population voting for you.  Or around 30% of voters.\n\nHowever, if you end up in a minority government (a party gets the most votes but does not get the 270). The 3rd place party holds the 'balance of power'.  They can vote with the government or against.  This ensures that the 70% that did not vote for the leading party is represented.\n\nThe system is wonky but it does have it's benefits. 
The CIA being demoralized is a great thing, not just for Americans but for the world. \n\n

Eh, he is using the term pedophile correctly.  If a person loves a 13 year old they are not a pedophile, they technically are an ephebophile.\n\nBut no one uses that term.  Anything under 18 is considered pedophile. (it is not)

Where is the_donald defending Todd Nickerson, a man who would fuck a child the day it became legal?\n\n\n>At age 8, I met a man who seemed to like me a great deal and was kind and gentle. I took to him immediately —he was a German who barely spoke English, a former acquaintance of my aunt and uncle’s who was visiting the U.S. and needed a place to stay. He stayed at my grandparents’ house next door for only one day. I was dragging the man (whose name I have long since forgotten) around my grandpa’s garden, showing him the vegetables and teaching him the English names for them, which he repeated happily. I enjoyed this game, and clearly so did he.\nAfter the garden tour, we sat together on the ground beside the garden and enjoyed each other’s company, and then, abruptly, he began to fondle me. I felt a bit confused but strangely exhilarated by this contact, as if it were simply another level of our friendship, or another part of the garden game. I taught him the English word for what it was he was touching — “pee-pee.” He smiled and repeated the word, which made me giggle. After he took his hand out of my shorts, I got up and left him sitting, running to brag about the experience to a relative, but she told we to stay away from him, which only made me feel guilty about the intimacy, and that I had done something wrong. Again, I internalized my feelings.\n\n.\n>I am out of the toybox, as I'm sure you're aware, and I look at little girls all the time--every day I say a little cutie or five at work, except today for some reason :-( , but that's okay. Most of my community knows about me, certainly everyone at work, and yet they don't seem to mind too much. I have yet to be attacked or even insulted, and most people seem to like me pretty well.\n\n.\n>When young girls go naked, I am liable to drool. :)\n\n\nA god damned hero of the Left movement if you ask me.\n\n>But when I examined the case in detail, it made me realize something: had sexuality of youths been accepted, it’s likely none of this would’ve happened. The rape occurred because J’s stepfather found images on her phone that she had ‘sexted’ to her boyfriend; he used these images to blackmail her into sex by threatening to divulge them to her real father unless she allowed him to screw her. She gave in, fearing disappointment and reprimands from her biological dad. Given this situation, and the fact that all three of the children and their mother were afraid of the stepfather, J figured she had no choice but to give in. She may not have fought her stepdad, but it was an act entirely against her will. **Now, if society didn’t make such a big holy deal about kids having sex**, J’s stepdad would’ve had no leverage to use against her in order to pressure her into sex, other than the implied threat of violence. He was a fuckwad of the first order, and I hold little doubt that the laws deterred him from taking what he wanted. But I wonder, had J been more psychologically armed, if her stepdad would’ve given up on the idea. I don’t know.\n\nHe changes his mind to being 'pro-touching'.

Guys I was just attacked by gay psychic vampires. Well, they may not have been gay.\n\nI had an episode of sleep paralysis, that I have not had in years.  In the dream skeletons broke through the window to get me with this loud persistent noise going on.  I ran back to the bedroom flipped on all the lights and could see myself sleeping.  The noise went away and I went back to the living room to find out everything was normal, so I went back to bed (in the dream) only to be awakened to the paralyses.  Having had this before I found out that it is best not to fight it or it gets worse, but I fought it.  Trying the hardest to scream out to my dog so that she would jump on the bed.  I fought really hard and was able to move my leg off the bed and break the paralysis. \n\nThat was close guys. They almost got me.

There does not seem to be a disconnect from the paralysis to breaking free.  I can see the room I am in, I can hear the sounds from the room I am in.  As far as I know I am awake. \n\nI used to have lucid dreams as a teenager.  I was able to find a way to control the dreams in a obscure way.  I used to wear glasses, then switched to contacts.  If I was in a dream and I was wearing glasses, I knew it was a dream and would be able to control that dream.  Eventually I stopped wearing glasses in my dreams and lost the ability to control them.

If you are worried about the landing stage this much over one spell that is extremely mediocre after landing stage then you need to re evaluate how you buy items. Don't buy a lotus for the regen that's is completely stupid and stop telling people what items to buy 
actually I just recently opened up like 10 gifts and it just seems dumb to have that up and not real informational posts you know?
Again you arent answering my question. AND you called michelle an it, what is actually wrong with you? Sarcastically saying I am tolerant then you call a woman an it, real classy
Still has nothing to do with my comparison? I'm asking because my view might be vastly different for most NBA fans LIKE the Dolan situation. 
You stop hitting the person it's quite simple really. The item isn't super strong but it's a good item right now. Rely on teammates or yourself to hold that person down while blade mail is popped and kill them after
The fact that the man that killed the shooter had ties with the mafia. Hidden documents about the whole case. There is some other blatant details I'm forgetting but I'm on my phone right now. Also I am not the person you originally commented on so maybe read the names before lol
Oh I know it's not great but I would say in about 15-20% of lanes the 2nd one would be playable.
The rating system is actually just crazy scary
Excellent discussion. Really glad you could understand what I'm trying to say 
Yeah you right I'm just still salty about people getting mad at torte for being toxic lol. I can see why this is a larger issue 
Ok I think I'm just dumb what I'm not sure what this map is representing can someone explain?
I understand the reasoning but you can get so many top picks without realizing the sixers have the players they want in Embiid, Simmons, and even Noel. We have to start winning at some point and need to stop constantly looking for young guys when we have so many great players already
I'm an outsider to this sub but I really want to know what you guys think in terms of if she is a good choice and some good or bad things about her. It seems the left is only bashing her but I want to hear both sides on this.
This needs to be taken down lol. People are gonna read the headline and just not read the rest and tarnish CoL rep. Please stop witch-hunting people jesus christ.
I think he did in his best interest to keep his ideals true. He endorsed Hilary because he and most people that followed him believed that between Hilary and Donald, Hilary was the lesser of two evils. This is of course there is some information on the subject I don't know of.
I assumed it was from an anime given the streamer but yeah i really love that part in he beginning a lot
Personally I think he falls in really well with our timing as a team since he is only 26 and can still get better. He is the kind of scorer our team seems to be missing and he is excellent on defense which is important against the super star small forwards in the league right now.
I think you linked the wrong tweet there
you are a moron lol
I now see that so I got what I was looking for 
Does anyone just think this is really wrong? Like PPD is a CEO of a top team that he will have to play against at some point. Conflict of interest or whatever but it just seems unprofessional and straight up wrong for the scene. It's either that or ppds role in EG isn't as much work as he says it's been 
You seem triggered. Stop acting like you are some 9k god and realize you make mistakes in games too but no one would call you out on it. Play dota and you will people good players like me have done it you have to learn too 
There was some files released a few years ago about the whole case. And I'm sure mafia and government have had connections in the past or it might have been a mafia only operation. I'm saying huge accusations with little back up here but the government working with criminals has happened before and it happened with guns and drugs in LA I believe. Might have the location wrong but it was during Reagan so after the shooting but still a case govt working with criminals for their own gain 
At this point the sixers are trying to play a 5 center lineup
Yeah my other comment has my profile just add me and check out my recent games that are solo queue.
The ones with Proud and Ursinity are going to be the best no matter what and the others I listen to just because I like listening to people talk dota 
That's what I think but would you say his move could alter the way players start to shift their careers and do things like this more often? If you can't win right away just leave for a better team instead of building
That went super well for Cousins too!
HOW ARE YOU SO FAST MAN
This is honestly terrible lol. The way it works now is good because the ONLY thing that matters is winning. Nothing else at all matters and thats how people should play the game. TO WIN.
but are ehome owners and management playing?
The show to me is few high MMR players dictating the conversation. When that happens since they are only 5k they definitely have flaws in their logic like the vlads PA

Oh sorry thanks man. I'm on mobile so I wasn't able to read that I will try that sub ! 
Holiday for Paul and hope Larry bird thinks it's Jrue who says no?
I think they are just doing a full rebuild and it seems those 2 first rounders were all they were getting. Also, Tyreke is still a scoring machine and time to develop Buddy. He gets a lot of shit but he is still a rookie and maybe the Kings are hoping he turns into a Solid starter while acquiring picks and maybe some offseason moves to change the dynamic of the team. If you think about it DMC was going to eat up any money the Kings had to pay out while not turning that into wins. We have seen DMC be such a damn good center for so many years but the Kings were never a playoff team. This is a very good change for them imo. Not right now but in 2-4 years we are gonna see it pan out better than what it looks like
Sometimes the NBA community has views on things I wouldn't think due to information I didn't know such as the whole Dolan situation. I thought Oakley was an ass and Dolan was in the right but after learning more it seems there is more to it
Why are you being a dick to random people making new posts on here? Do you need to compensate for something?
Well I just like to believe there is more to the assassination than what you first said. My personal theory is Oswald was forced into pulling the trigger and the mafia silenced him which they technically did. Obviously the simple answers are much easier to prove because I factually can't disprove your theory
I think it's because history as shown these major events usually have more than one cog in the works. Obviously all theories can't be true that's why they are called theories. People just find it hard to believe that one man was able to assassinate the president and that he was murdered before a trial all from coincidence. There are definitely facts that point to him not being alone but more point to him being alone
You think PG is better at SG? I never was a fan of him there and don't know enough about it but he seems extremely flexible in the floor 
Wow you actually posted this. It shows how self inflated you are 
Really am not sure how else to make it more clear man. If you can't see the correlation than you are just being extremely stubborn. It's quite easy to see that less girls that play games are going to play dota because it is a harder games.\nNot because they are dumber but it's the same reason a lot of my friends prefer call of duty on Xbox over dota on pc. It's simply much easier to buy an Xbox, pop in a disc, and play the game.
I hate you 
Yeah you need to get off your high horse cause I guarantee you literally just don't know people. Some people seem like they are fake but aren't and it's how they are. If you refuse to see that cause you are stubborn that's your fault 
I just donated their college fund. MATCH ME! 
Why is this even a thing. Like literally one side has a disadvantage from minute one and seems a bit insane to think about. Its like a soccer game where one team scores 6 points for every goal and the over scores 4 points for every goal.

Make your profile so they wont know? How is this on Valve? Your situation is such a small percentage of players it literally means nothing
If you believe this you don't understand the hero at all and you need to think a little harder. A good player will be pressuring towers and cutting lanes any chance they get. There are much worse carries than him right now. Bad player are attracted to am but the hero is good.
I mean in an honest sense what's the downsides of allowing this? Just seems like they forgot to add the option 
I ask a question and expected straight forward answers not whatever you were trying to do 
Because it's guaranteed at this point that the Kings will finish worse than the sixers so we mind as well start build a winning culture and grab the Kings pick in the process
Honestly lyrical is such a calming voice to listen to and makes the streams so much more enjoyable but when I saw he wasn't casting I instantly turned it off and went to dotatv

Well she was his biggest threat running for the democratic nominee so obviously he is going to disagree with her as much as he did. I get she is everything he was against but it's political suicide to endorse someone of the opposite campaign so he has to endorse her because she carried the democratic views he had as a whole and was against trump on a more field of issues instead of a few big ones if you know what I mean. I just think it's unfair say he is a sellout when its a bit logical what he did

It's a straight up bad skill build lol

Just want to make sure you know the hero isn't bad it's players. He is a very popular hero( I think) and bad players love the afk farm play style and he does it best. Seeing a bad AM player is truly disappointing.

Lol dude you are dumb or something. This guy is being himself and you seem to be lacking socially to understand that 
I'm not saying anything about any assertions? I just said if you want to disagree it would be nice to go into detail. And there are a lot of sketchy details about the JFK assassination so its hard to deny the fishiness of the whole thing 
I like to see who they are even quoting so i know if its worth remembering. 
Yeah honestly what does a sponsor get out of signing you? You guys are terrible and nobody wants to watch you play in all seriousness 
Took a while to get that bit of information out. Sometimes there is background knowledge as to why something happens such as bad blood between KD and the OKC front office. Something like this would explain it or Durant was just taking the easy route.
you are probably going to be downvoted to hell but you are absolutely right. But it isnt a matter of girls not being smart enough to play it but they are generally less interested in such games.

I am drawing out how administrators make "policy" decisions called "local preferences."  These preferences help decide how your data will be routed between ASes (autonomous systems) based on a company or institution's desire for speed, cost, security or other constraints on the route. In this case, AT&T is the preferred route and assigned a higher weight because the administrator determined that cost was the highest priority when choosing an internet service provider (ISP) even though Verizon was faster.\n\nThe CNN and Wikileaks systems represent other entities that an administrator can choose to flag as dangerous and block or choose to allow.  Ironically, our institution blocks all access to Wikileaks on our intranet so I use the contrary as an example - in an ideal world CNN would be blocked.  
I used the lens on f1.8 the whole time with ISOs between 800 and 5000 and shutter speeds between 150 and 500.  I used its built in color scheme rather than s-log2 because I don't really have the ability or skill to do good color correction right now.  Thanks for stopping by!

It's amazing (it's not) that the media still hasn't learned anything. Every day they have a headline of something "so horrible" that Trump just did that will be the end of him.  Remember how they did that every single day prior to the election and then....Trump won...?

Hello, haha, thanks! She is a sweet dog.\n\nI didn't use any noise correction software.  The only thing I did in post was a little brightness on 2 or 3 clips and some color correction on 3 clips that were shot in s-log.  I'm still trying to figure out color correction, how to manage the auto-focus and trying to get the most steady shots.\n\nAll ISOs were between 800 and 5000 for the most part.  A few really low light scenes were shot as high as 128000 but there still isn't any terrible noise.  I bought the A7SII mostly because of the low light ability and I haven't been disappointed yet!

You're right, but Trump also needs people he can trust 100%.  He went through three campaign managers because he demands a high standard.  I think we can be sure this will turn out for the better.  Besides, Flynn was a bit of a war hawk for Iran.  We don't need more wars right now.

Thank you for the explanation and distinction.  I think that the media has been going the route of propaganda given the evidence of their collusion with the DNC/Obama.  The Clinton Foundation and "donations" by MSM figures made the state and the media line very blurry.\n\nAnd I'm not sure if you're fully aware, but the Trump dossier is not a leak, it's a hoax.  It was fan fiction believed to be truth and then published by MSM.\n\nPodesta's e-mails were verified to be true.  The Trump dossier is false.  Therefore it is "fake news" to be spreading around fiction.  That is not hypocritical.  And if we discover that the CIA was intentionally spreading these lies, then we are moving much closer to "state-sponsored" and therefore "propaganda."
So if Christians don't need science to explain the supernatural resurrection of Jesus then why do they need science to explain the "supernatural" creation?
Thank you for re-posting.  I didn't even know about this sub!
Guess I gotta screen shot all of my comments now.
Done!
You just used "truth" and "media" in the same sentence.  It's no wonder you still don't understand the people you disagree with.
Well if you're not made of 250 lbs of muscle then I'm sure you're made of 250 lbs of hacker goodness or just plain amazing!  
Good point
How much did the detective cost?
Thank you so much for the tips.  I'm excited to try that now! I've been meaning to play with the frame rate a bit.\n\nSo far I really like the 55mm.  I never want to take it off because it is so sharp.  I've never owned a prime lens before so it's weird not being able to zoom but that just means I move back and forth more to get the right distance for the shot.  I upgraded from a Nikon D90 so I'm just enjoying being in an entirely new universe of camera with the A7SII.  It's a hobby for me but I needed to jump on the HD DSLR at some point.  My gopro just wasn't cutting the low light scenes.\n\nI can't even imagine what the next gen features will be....
God is not his name so you can spell it.  It is a title.  YHWH is the Hebrew way to write his name without the vowels.
Seriously, how many mosques do you see doing community outreaches or clean ups?  I've yet to see a mosque be a blessing to their community.
I thought that publishing fake news (propaganda) was more closely associated with fascism...?
A lot of the difficulty you may run into by sharing stats and "studies" with people is that we have all been lied to by authorities so many times that there is a healthy reason to distrust people publishing something for a buck or to validate their funding.\n\nHow many times have I been told that butter is bad for me and margarine is good and then the opposite the next week? Or that the non-coding region of DNA is junk and then all of a sudden it is the source of all coding? Or that the sun revolves around the earth like in Galileo's day.  Looking at the history of science gives me reason to meet all new "facts" with a very healthy dose of skepticism- climate change, evolution and vaccines being among the more controversial.
Nice!
Well lately they've just invited artists to play a track to lip sync to anyway. 
Cool.  Thanks for the link.  Interesting article.\n\nYeah I pretty much go with Answer in Genesis' statement that "if you can't trust God with the rising of the sun, then you can't trust him with the rising of the Son."  Basically that if God says He created the earth in 6 days, then he can and did do it just the same as Jesus said he would come back after three days.  Dr. Russell Humphreys has done some great research and has fascinating creation models that are consistent with both the Bible and observable science.  Give him a look!
Girl.....? Hmmmmmm 
Haha thank you! I appreciate the feedback.  You're right. I'm having trouble learning the balance between light and depth of field. I did almost everything at 1.8 because I get so much light.  It doesn't make sense to me how I can shoot at 1.8 and do a landscape scene just fine as long as I'm focused to infinity but the same infinity focus doesn't work well up close.  I guess if you stick something right in front of the camera its infinity focus is more obvious than in a landscape shot.
Ok thank you for that.  I understand what you're saying, but why is the question of Jesus' resurrection not a philosophical explanation too? \n\nIn other words, God speaking creation into existence is a supernatural event - it is above the natural world and cannot be explained by science.\n\nJesus rising from the dead is supernatural - cannot be repeated or put in a test tube... I'm still trying to see how they're different... Thanks! 
So where in the executive order does it say anything about banning Muslims?  Sounds like another episode of fake news.
Hillary Clinton sets new record: first presidential candidate to lose Michigan three times in one election!
You're right.  He's black....  Some people see him as black Moses or the MLK of our day.
Good thing gun laws are so permissive so you can protect yourself....wait....
And Omar Mateen's wife is still on the loose...
Yes.  I pray that our eyes are open to the ineffective foreign policy we have forced on the world at much cost to others' lives.
Or frozen in terror....
Fake news: they were kicked out 
Here is one such list from [infogalactic ](https://infogalactic.com/info/List_of_businesses_that_refuse_to_work_with_Donald_Trump)  (the uncucked Wikipedia).\n\nThere are many others that deserve to be banned like Kellogg's for refusing to advertise on conservative websites.  If they want to play politics, I'm perfectly fine eating my Cheerios....
There they go making everything about race again.  Remind me who is color blind again?!
But The Donald predicted a Trumpslide so hard that they convinced me to gamble for the first time in my life.  It was an eye opening experience to receive free money from liberals! Now I know how they feel taking my tax money!!!!
Look man, you caught me in the act of being transphobic.  I guess the left was right about me.  I'm deplorable!
That's a great idea...but unfortunately I'll have to go back into the wild where I released Mister Bunny and ask him to come back for 11 more pictures :(
I agree though - there are plenty of morons who stayed on board with MSM even after the election exposed how irrelevant and full of lies the media is.
Is there a good thread over at r/redacted about this guy so I can enjoy watching them bite the bait?!
Yep.  Liberal logic.
He wants to see the DNC continue on the path to self-destruction.\n
Definitely grounds for them to be kicked out  of their profession.  Trump can also sue them.\n
You can definitely blame the victim for anyone who opens the door to these rapist jihadists.
Guess he's unaware of facial recognition software.\n
He was adopted, wasn't he?  He could have been a Jew raised as a Catholic.\n\nNow these are the things that can be addressed in his book, which I was looking forward to.  \n
Pure fiction.\n
Amazing work.  That should sell for a lot of money.  \n\n
Definitely shower doors.  I guess working in a bathtub leaves an easier to clean crime scene.\n
It helps when you have all the MSM on your side.\n
I did laugh when he said "placards".  So that's what you call those things.\n
That's exactly why they SHOULD have it.  These events were created specifically because children are afraid of cops.  Jeez, the stupidity!\n
Also one of his chimera mentions.\n
I hope he can create a platform for more gay conservatives to join in.  It will be fabulous!\n\n
They've done more to create pollution in the area than the pipeline ever will.\n
Being named after a pedophile rapist must have it's privileges.\n\n  
Read your fucking Bible, people.  You do not greet the people who bring a false doctrine.  They are the anti-Christ. If you do so, you are taking part in their evil ways.
Do they also take money for taking immigrants to help spread the jihad?\n
My dad had an extremely straight and rigid posture from being in the ROTC.   He only did that to pay for college, though.  But he always had that military posture.  
How does anyone find her pussy?\n
I hope it means we can launch Cher and friends into space.\n
I hope it's the real deal.  
The don't represent the new Republicans.\n\n\n
How many of them fart in the face of the guy behind them?\n\n
He sounds retarded when  he talks.   Unelectable material there if he thinks all his spouting off is going to help him run for president.   
Political correctness is nothing more than a Marxist weapon.\n
How delusional to think the Clintons are a "great family"?\n\n
It could form some kind of singularity and suck in the entire galaxy.  \n
He should be arrested for aiding and abetting. \n\n
Those two statements do not contradict each other.\n
Well I hope they don't give in to that sort of stupid nonsense.   He doesn't need their input.  Those people are just as out of touch and living in their own little protected fantasy bubbles as all the other limousine liberals.
And If there was a breeze that blew the poison back on the person spraying?

When someone mentions an incident in Sweden, the only response is, "which one?"\n
Good idea.\n
On the plus side, he's got a lot of new material to keep adding to it until he finds another publisher to do it.\n\n
They don't have any reason to support getting a subpoena.\n\n
I'm glad I live on high ground.  \n
Maybe that was a very early list of speakers.  
He had some melanoma skin cancer carved out of his face on the left side.   He's actually had it several times since 1993, the worst being in 2000.  \n
Same as usual, I'd imagine.  Type them on the AMA post when it starts.  But he'll be streaming a video at the same time.
Fox News: "More than 20,000 people outside, unable to get in."  
It's never too early!   Maybe he can help out with the 2018 election to get some more senate seats.
He wouldn't pass a background check to get a gun.
Freedom of religion also applies to government employees.  
He's just trying to convince people that he's part of a BIG movement.  Which is why the left is afraid of him and why he's facing censorship problems with his advertising.

Hope it's the PedoGate arrests about to commence.   It's long overdue.  Notice how they started at the ground level operations when they started their sweeps.  You have to expect it's time to move up the food chain. And SkippyPedosta sure loves his pizza.
I only use DuckDuckGo.  They claim they don't track you or store your personal info.\n
Light in the loafers.\n
The riot was caused by a drug-related arrest.\n\n
God bless David Clarke.  He's no slouch!\n
>The Democrats are just screaming and pooping in their diapers.\n\n
They've lowered the levels enough that it's able to handle the rain now.   It's the slow flooding downstream that's the real problem.\n
They are either bought and paid for or being blackmailed because someone has a tape of them raping a child.\n\n
It's also a much stiffer penalty for rioting at an even with SS protection.
https://duckduckgo.com/?q=dutch+royal+family+pedo+hunting+party&t=ffsb&ia=web\n\n
That was it's intended use before Trump bought it.  Now it is finally being used that way.  \n
McCain acts like he's been blackmailed into acting like a Democrat.\n
Your choice is male, female or mentally ill.\n\n
She looks frail.  She might not last that long.\n
Her snatch must smell like vinegar.  
If you ask the people who have to live in the same neighborhoods with those gang member thugs, they'll tell you they  want them out.   The  black people of LA would also like to get their old neighborhoods back because they've been forced out by all the illegals.  
They often kill them off once they start getting too old.\n\n
Why is that camera allowed in a place where it could block traffic and cause a disruption.\n
I remember that.  Hard to believe though.\n
The first Amendment doesn't give anyone the right to have access to the president or to ask questions.   
She's not even a real blonde.  She's a faux Swede.\n
Trump just removed Obama's unconstitutional rules that forced schools to allow men into the girls' restroom.  It's up to the states to ban if they want to.\n
I never look at the front page.\n
Why isn't he arrested yet?\n\n
I am surprised that there are still people around who DON'T know already that Sweden has become the rape capital of Europe.  Guess I've been reading T_D so long I forgot.
People think it's Pedosta because it's a really good voice match.\n

If they can get Milo they'll go after Bannon next.\n
The EPA went too far by including any puddle as navigable waterways to make it impossible for any mines to exist.    They'll be cutting the government overreach, not destroying rivers.
There has to be a link to the actual email on the WikiLeaks site for it to even be considered real.
Hijabs make you look fat.\n\n
Takei got a 2nd degree tuck. 
Milo has a long ways to go before he joins the ranks of Podesta and all those other Clinton cronies.

There's a huge difference between a gay teen being confused or curious and having sex with an older man than the predatory child sex slave network that takes very young children to torture and turn into sex slaves for the elites.
#Make Chicago Republican Again!\n
Yes, although there's a "heart attack gun" that  shoots a frozen pellet of potassium.  Or, as they used to show on Law and Order: Criminal Intent, you can just bump into someone and stick them with a syringe needle.  \n
The new cops makes you feel like you're living in a defeated and occupied territory.
The United States never would have happened without an electoral college agreement.  Remote and rural states never would have joined in without getting a say in the elections.   Even back then they knew that coastal high-density populations would crowd out their votes.
Trump didn't make any new rules. \n\n
A lot of them are committing felonies without  even thinking about it, since stealing a social security number to get a job is felony identity theft and voting as an illegal is also a felony.  It's not all about armed robbery or rape.  But either way, they all should be thrown out.    \n\nThen there are many who haven't done that, but they are driving without insurance, without a license and driving drunk.  Why should we wait until an innocent citizen is killed before they are deported or jailed?  We don't need to by playing Russian Roulette on our highways.\n\nWithout committing extra crimes, illegals are crowding our schools, crowding our hospitals, using up taxpayer money to pay for all of that and they are taking up too much of the already scarce affordable housing, which forces American citizens to be homeless.  
In Saudi, she'd get thrown to the ground and beaten with a stick if caught out in public like that.\n
The unelected ones are appointed by the president.  That would give Trump the power to appoint his own media.
The shoe!  The pizza!\n\nThat's all that's left of Hillary is her shoe.
I like my own recipe best.  But I'm sure the White House version Trump brought to them is also fabulous.\n
They can't win any argument with the facts and real logic.  For them, it's all about the fee fees.\n\n
Trump 2020 signs.  Time to get ready for next time already!\n\n
It was the fake news that kept saying she was lying and shouldn't be allowed on the shows.  \n
It's very therapeutic.\n
Bernie makes is seem like Republicans have just landed on this planet  from outer space with some evil agenda.  Yeah, Republicans have all the same concerns as anyone else.  That's exactly why we voted to MAGA!\n
**2 John NIV -** \n\n7 I say this because many deceivers, who do not acknowledge Jesus Christ as coming in the flesh, have gone out into the world. Any such person is the deceiver and the **antichrist**. \n\n8 Watch out that you do not lose what we have worked for, but that you may be rewarded fully. \n\n9 Anyone who runs ahead and does not continue in the teaching of Christ does not have God; whoever continues in the teaching has both the Father and the Son. \n\n10 If anyone comes to you and does not bring this teaching, do not take them into your house or welcome them. \n\n11 Anyone who welcomes them shares in their wicked work.
I hope it lives up to the hype.  \n
They just had a report on Fox Report where it showed the left has a strategy and a handbook on how to make this seem organic. Glad the President saw this. 
Who knows if it's real or not, but it definitely seems like they are feeling the heat...maybe like the heat from a pizza oven? The Milo thing might be so they can say "See, everyone one does it. Look at Milo".
Of course not. That meme was ripped off from us.
Curious. What was the final straw?

>White House Fingers John McCain\n\n( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)\n\nI bet he likes it too.
It's hard for people to understand because of the brainwashing they received.

Yes. There's a few of us. Hey, could be worse. I could be a Blues and a Hawks fan.

The media has a crush! 
Is McCain planning to runaway with Hillary and he's apartment shopping? 
\\m/
If they censored us anymore, we would be like a Muslim woman under Sharia law. 
I feel he won't be the only one leaving the party. 
I wonder what she had on CNN? 
Awesome :) 
3 to 6 months I would say. Maybe less everything moves at a lightening speed in the Trump era of news. The left will always smear him with this, unfortunately. 
Nope, not that I'm aware of. 
I'm triggered as well. My wife's children are crying. I am literally shaking and crying. I've been holding them ever I saw this post. What will I tell them?
That was a joke? Get real. 
>He's actually a very large man... sort of intimidating. \n\nB-b-but according to reddit, he's tiny. 
Top dollar will always be PCGS then NGC and then the ANACS and ICG. Just what the market dictates. If you plan on selling it go with PCGS or NGC. If you will sell it in the future, you can always see if it will get graded at PCGS (they won't crack the slab if you tell them). 
Just wait until Trump gets in his full sized form.

Hmmm... Let's see why they would want to hack Indiana and Georgia:\n\n*Indiana:* Pence was the governor of Indiana. Hacking it so it would turn blue would be proof of 'look at how toxic Drumpf is, his running mate is from a red state and the public rejected his message so much that it turned blue'.\n\n*Georgia:* Remember the media hysteria that it might turn blue when in reality it went no where near that. This was to show that 'Drumpf is so horrible that even deep red states are disavowing him and the Republican party's message' . So Republicans do their 2016 "audit , their takeaway is to become more liberal. \n\nThank God that Trump was stronger than their hacking. 
Fuck the children... \n\nOh wait, that would have happened with Hillary and Skippy in power. 
CNN: Trump supporters can't tell minorities apart.

I think the media was counting their inflated egos and multiple personalities. 
>“We’re calling for a general strike that would include every single person involved in making motion pictures in Hollywood, starting with the actors and celebrities themselves and encompassing companies in charge of making props, movie memorabilia and even souvenir shops.” Said a source.\n\n**Reason #47,897 on why Trump won.**\n\nOut of touch lefties in Hollywood want the average person in the movie industry to strike. Do they think that people work their job(s) because it's fun? Do they not understand that us plebs need money? During this 'strike' we can't make some extra cash by signing autographs at comic con, hocking magical weightloss teas on our Instagram or film a reality show in the US. Shit, if they don't need the money(they don't)  then they will go to Monaco for a few months to take a vacation. We need money to function, to survive. \n\nVery selfish of them to call a strike when it effects everyone involved in that film industry and not just them. I guess us plebs can always live off the millions that we earn from our ~~movies~~ jobs. If things get tough, we can always sell the kids to pizzerias to make up some extra cash.

So what you are saying is that Finland has a similar definition for rape like Sweden, has more than 3 times fewer rapes. I mean I get the whole definition argument when you compare Sweden to Congo but shouldn't it be worrying that Sweden has more rapes compared with the Nordic countries?

They (the people in charge) don't want to do the data analysis (or release it since they do a lot of secret data analysis) because they don't have the result they want. The result they want is that Sweden has many rapes because of categorizing more acts as rape. The result they always get is that people with immigrant backgrounds commit a majority of all the rapes.
I remember the fake news stories about trump supporters going out handing out free weed and booze to black people so they wouldn't vote on election day. Liberals are really the true racists thinking black people would just go and smoke weed all day.

Your estimate sounds a little on the low side, are you a shill? :o
I myself actually counted the multiple rape data and if you remove all the multiple rapes from the statistic so it becomes easier to compare with other countries, Sweden's total rape number goes down by 15-20%. So even though people who I even know likes to tout that as the solution to the Swedish rape problem, it's not the entire story. Sweden still has many more rapes.    \nThe new rape legislation was introduced in 2005. I think I saw some other numbers in this thread that even before 2005 Sweden had more rapes than norway.\n
Just wait until I run for office and Aftonbladet finds my reddit account I'll tell you that much.

yeah. i pretty sure he is crying tears of joy. happiest moment of his life.
What's fucked up about it is that in the Swedish constitution, freedom of speech is only guaranteed through the media. If you say something outside of the medial sphere that is classed as hate speech you are fucked.

Maybe the refugees themselves know how stupid my swedish politicians are and want to shut them up.
I think they do. I think you should be able to do very good regular cross comparisons between the nordic countries. I don't think the differences in definition is so radically different that it would make rapes in Sweden 3x higher. When you look at the convicted people, a majority of the convicted people have migrant backgrounds. Even though they stand for 20% of the population.
Ya but there is the 30% payroll tax too
here's an crazy idea. Lets make the punishment for rape, death by RAPE! Make one of those thrusting machines and attach a dildo to it and run it until they die!

This riot was by the citizens of the suburb and suburbs around it. They do these kinds of riots several times in a span of just a few years with dozens of burnt cars and such. The police knows who did the rioting, and it is not immigrants as you say. It's people born to immigrants in Sweden and they have known this for years. If they were to do arrests the rioting would get even worse, remember that the riots started because they arrested a person on the wanted list for drug related crime. The police doesn't want to escalate the rioting.

Hey, I have a MBA, here's my perspective. Get an MBA only if it's necessary for your career path. Since you don't have a career path, don't waste your time on an MBA. Finally, if you need an MBA for promotion, get the least expensive, accredited MBA that your employer will accept. I got mine from a state school for about $15k, most of which was paid for as I earned money at my day job, $2.5k from loans.\n\nThe MBA isn't a magic ticket to a career, any more than your BS was a magic ticket to a career. Focus instead on finding work you won't hate (or may like) in a growing industry that you are interested in in joining that has a career path to $100k+ income. Find a successful mentor in that industry (this will probably take time), then work like you've never worked before to be the most anazing guy in the industry they ever saw. It's not guaranteed to work, but where you are now isn't so awesome, either.\n\nETA: MBAs should be done when there is a promotional commitment with *higher compensation attached*. Otherwise, they're purely speculative.

I'm not sure about that. I know a couple that are US immigrants from Australia. They were born in AUS and have family there, but have lived in the US (LEGALLY!), worked here (LEGALLY!), and built an entire life here for decades. I'm really hesitant to say "pick one" to someone like that.\n\nMaybe it's because citizenship is the only way (I know of) to get permanent status in the US. I would be more inclined to support your position if there were a non-citizen suite of rights that guaranteed a lot of what citizens enjoy, like some sort of super-visa that never had to be renewed, for people who need to retain another citizenship.

Bingo.\n\nI've been thinking about what "privilege" really means in the US, and have come to the conclusion that it means cultural inheritance of values. For example, I inherited the values of integrity, work ethic, sobriety, and a respect for education from my parents, and they from theirs, and so on. Thus, I have a better result in my life (better employment, more social respect, higher income).\n\nWhat they don't seem to understand is that *they can have "privilege", too*, and all the good things that come with it, *if* they also work hard, be honest, are sober, and get an education. The problem is that's a lot of work, so we see people trying to get the good things in life with short-cuts. None of the short-cuts will work, but I guess looting a Walgreens and setting a Starbucks on fire is a lot more fun than showing up for work every morning and applying yourself.

Counseling and advice. All it takes is one stupid decision to nuke a lifetime of saving. I help prevent that. And, we use low cost index investing for our clients. Since I'm paid fee-only, I can get investment product at "institutional" pricing and can pass the savings on to clients. We do a lot of ETF and individual bonds, with some of the balance in no-load low expense ratio funds for certain clients and asset classes. 
Top 10 tornadoes. Jesus.
Sorry, no citation, but I have heard that most species have blends and the proportions vary from locality to locality, and even among individuals. I think I got the info from Viperkeeper on YouTube. 
Anything worth doing is worth overdoing.
Oh my.
> We can't bring the factories back, it's too late.\n\nAnd yet here they are, flooding back into the US.
I could see myself using a system like this. I've got all debt paid off, a fully-funded emergency fund, my 10% into a 401k and an additional monthly savings goal of $1,000 for a down payment for a rent house. Short of brain cancer, I'm good on emergencies. Even so, I only have about $150 to $250 per month beyond that for PMs. I would be interested in something like this.\n\nI can see this working as a discount/trade-up program.  Sign up for monthly purchases on the date of your choice (1-28). Every month your account will be drafted and a fractional will be sent. You can "press pause" or leave the program at any time. The program offers at a pre-set premium percentage over spot that is a bit less than just buying from a dealer. You can also set a max-spot-price so that the bank draft never exceeds "x" dollars, for customer safety on fast moves. After you have enough fractional to get a 1 oz AGE, you can trade up for free by sending in your fractionals. There will be some who trade up, and some who use it as a disciplined savings program. If you auto-draw from a bank account, you also use an eCheck/EFT for faster turn-around. As an added bonus for signing up, a monthly market outlook email could be offered, along with special advance notice of sales.\n\nThis would be good for the dealer since it's easy to plan ahead to allow for lower inventory and easier hedging. The set-and-forget feature also makes customers "stickier", and also with the email report and advance notice of sales, and consistently slightly-below-normal market price.
My God, can you imagine the sudden spike in boating accidents?
Thanks!
No, because it doesn't give "persecution points," which can be used later to express moral superiority.

Rent for a year to get to know the market really, really well. The money on a fix-and-flip is made when you buy at a great price. It will also give you time to get some money saved up for the renovation.
WTF? Who owns this country, citizens or the masses yearning to get in?
(laughter)
Nice, well done. You'll want to have it re-edited, though. "could sell there silver eagles" should be "could sell th*eir* silver eagles", and "doomsday" is usually written as one word.
Good idea! I'm so used to Trump just winning, winning, winning, I forget he's ~~human~~ a God Emperor Supreme.
For extra lulz, watch YouTube CC struggle to understand his gangsta-pidgin.
People already do. But they only get away with it if they are Liberal or Muslim.\n\nYou either let people make their own decisions and choices, or you do it for them. There is no in-between. My personal rule: Don't let the government do to others what you wouldn't want them doing to you. Because when the winds change or when a fresh scapegoat is needed, they WILL do it to you.
This has nothing to do with tradition. It is simply animal instincts at work. You simply don't "get" it until you get pregnant or have a kid yourself. Nobody does. They call it a life-changing experience for a reason, and that reason isn't entirely money. Your brain changes priorities, pheromones are shared, suddenly you know things you didn't before, and you find yourself doing things "right" that you were never taught. It's all built in. Us humans are just dumb enough to forget we are animals.\n\nNot to mention every animal species would be utterly screwed if there wasn't some sort of dopamine reward for raising their young.\n\nEver wonder why people with kids at the office are always talking about their kids? They literally cannot help it. Their brains are wired for child rearing. Ever wonder why empty nesters are depressed and go crazy-insane happy at the thought of grandkids? Same.\n\nAs for career prospects.... Never stopped me. Or many other women out there. Seems the closed minded one is you. Now go study some biology before you try again.
That lady has some guts.
Exactly. A lot of people don't realize that Rush Limbaugh has been saying this stuff for years. The term has been ruined over the years, mostly by SJWs. SJWism isn't really a new thing.... It's just the left pushed so hard they overplayed their hand, making folks ripe for the "red pillings" we see today.
Needs that picture with the two buttons.
Hey, don't punish Alaska over this... What did they ever do to you?
Hey now, Jay Leno doesn't deserve that comparison.\n\nBesides...thus guy's chin isn't big enough.
Heh. And meanwhile video games have never been more relaxing for me.
Methinks this particular woman will be eventually eliminated from the gene pool at this rate....
I slept in and actually forgot. When I woke up, Trump was president. I honestly don't mind, because I was freaked out that one of these looney groups was going to cause trouble. No stress...
Damn that's good.
Indeed. I thought about jokingly asking "where's Waldo?" but there's an entire group of people in Waldo hats visible.
I remember my first ultrasound... Only a few weeks in and my son was swimming around in there...Just a tiny little person. \n\nWhatever people want to argue about abortion, let's not mince words. You are killing a fellow human if you do it.
Haven't watched the academy awards in years. Was sick of them taking potshots at conservatives every other sentence. Oh, and I'm ditching cable TV  today....
I wouldn't call it hard so much as looooooooooooong. You're gonna be in there a few hours to solo it. It starts getting really slow from the third floor on. The enemies have very heavy hitpoints.\n\n
Oh, but don't you know that Asians are ultra-whites for some stupid reason or another? /s
Poems law is strong with this one.
Huh. Is that a glasses-case? Trump wears glasses? 
Ouch on that burn....
It's ironic, because Hillary reminded me heavily of Delores Umbridge. And if there's a real life Voldemort, it's Soros. The heroes are the normal people... The ones who have to give up their comfort zone and risk everything to fight back.
There's actually a book about it. "Who Really Cares". It's a good read.
What was the event?
It's complicated. In terms of marraige, tradition plays a part, and most on the right would be content with being left alone to their beliefs and not being forced to take part in the sin of another person. To a lot of Christians, taking part in a gay marraige is being an enabler to another person's personal failing... Like giving a beer to an alcoholic. They may not hold any dislike for the person who happens to be the alcoholic (sinner) but that shouldn't mean they have to approve of everything they do....or participate. To Christians, "gay" is a person's choice, not an identity. Best answer: Get government out and everyone can do whatever they want.\n\nAbortion is not really a religious issue, but libs love to frame it that way. Do you believe the unborn are human...and at what point? To many, religious or not, it is as simple as acknowledging that it is the "right" to kill another person who has no say in the matter, and no defense. Being pregnant can also vastly change your outlook on this, as you are very aware that someone is inside you. \n\nIt's also worth noting that the "slippery slope" is very real on this, and that there are countries currently arguing the "right" to kill those seen as a drain on resources, including children. In Nazi Germany, that eventually translated into euthanasia of people who never asked for it, then genocide. What is the worth of human life? Is each one something precious to be preserved in its limited budget, or are the young and old inconveniences to those in their prime? These are questions everyone needs to ask before coming to any conclusion on abortion.
Dear CNN,\n\nThe definition of insanity is trying the same thing over and over and expecting a different result. Your Alinsky-crap doesn't work on Trump.\n\nSigned, some random person who is starting to pity you.\n
Can only improve the food quality...\n\nBut I would rather this happen because of changes in market demand.
Dunno about that, but there are folks who work in cyber-warfare, hacking, and the like.
Actually, somewhere before the lunch there was a bit of footage where it looked like Barron had a female soldier giggling. Charming the ladies already, eh?
Shariablue appears to be brigading the Amazon comments. :(
Waitaminute, I thought the Trump Train already existed!\n\nOMG TIME TRAVEL!\n\n*mind blown*
Actually I think the world record is 7. Not that I condone that sort of thing.
Well, supposedly it's based on pheromones put out by a kid's father. If there is no father around at all, period starts earlier.\n\nProbably some sort of r/K thing.
To be fair, that's because said government was looking for any possible reason to crucify them.
I'm pretty sure most guys I know wouldn't go for women like this.
Well, I wonder if they do, how many of us it would take to buy a controlling interest in both companies. Just imagine Starbucks with an open-carry rule. XD
Beat me to it. They are different concepts. Attempts at perpetual motion machines have been debunked due to requiring an outside source. As long as it would take, eventually the Sun will run out of energy and die.
Have to say I didn't know what to expect when I pulled up her music in groove. Wasn't expecting techno. I suppose I should now say that we have the best techno. :)
So easy a comeback....I loved this one.
I feel a great disturbance in the force... The sound of many Nintendo employees crying out in disgust.
People forget that child rearing is pleasurable. It is a joy. Yeah, it's hard. But as the birth clinic ladies would say, the same hormones that got the baby in there are at work afterward. \n\nThere would be no sex if there wasn't an intended result. This is also why women who have abortions are often an emotional wreck afterwards. They have violated those animal instincts and killed their own young. And the hormones punish them in kind.
They know a powerful ally when they see it. Even if they take him grudgingly.
Part of me wonders if Trump and co. have been setting up fake scenarios to "leak" in order to catch leakers.
I like that. I'm gonna steal it.
Agreed. 200 pounds would have you looking a bit chubby/flabby, with maybe a double chin. Takes a lot more to get that round face/no neck thing going. I'd wager 250+ easily.
Technically he hasn't done it yet. I think congress is still trying to work out the details of the repeal. This is just a temporary bandaid.\n\nStill...not sick of winning yet. He'll have to try harder. ;)
You sure it isn't to make the next great day come sooner?
To be fair, some cities use spring water for their source. \n\n\n
What's with the old lady haircut?
Do you really think this guy could catch a loose dog?

Nope 
I'd so want that as a bumper sticker if I didn't live in fear of my car's tires. :P
Those kids always got stuck in the shrine of the silver monkey....
What gets me is I really did enjoy Starbucks. Yeah, I knew they were liberal, but so's every other coffee shop. And I really loved those egg bites.\n\nSaying they didn't want peoples' business was an UTTERLY STUPID MOVE. Let the left eat their Alinsky tactics from now on.
Once saw a Taurus get in a fight with a much larger Chevy van and win. Stuff like that is why cops like 'em. 
Just roll with it. :)
Hey, I'm in New Mexico and I use that one. :P I hate winter.
Yeah, I was worried a bit too. I went and took a shower to calm down, then made the family a nice dinner. A bit later Trump was leading Florida and I brought out dessert!\n\nWatched the meltdown late into the night. It was priceless!
Yeah, I'm gonna say money too.
Weird thing is the usual office SJW has been on vacation this week. I'm wondering if she was somehow over there.
There are not enough upvotes in the world for this.
The thing about trains is you can always add another car or engine. There will always be room. :)
The thing is, the states are intended to act almost as individual countries. The electoral college was supposed to prevent states like California from bullying states like Alaska. And it damn worked too! The voter fraud would definitely have been allowed to continue had Hillary been elected. Now it's finally going to be looked into.
Soros dumped his stock. Give it a year. In the meantime, there are other theme parks out there.
The unsaid elephant in the room is the fact that this number is "at least", and doesn't include dead voters, people who vote multiple times, etc.
Thank you, liberals, for cleaning up after yourselves. Next time don't graffiti the trains in the first place.
Well, there's still a few Windows Phone holdouts. Waiting on that mythical surface phone. XD
Bingo. Things got personal. It would have been worse had the Dems and media done it.\n\nTo be honest, I find myself wondering how much Ted knew about the whole pizza thing, and if Trump was the one who ended up telling him. "Complyin" really doesn't do him justice. Previously he was mostly fighting the rest of Congress alone. He's all-in for Trump now.
Indeed. Breast feeding is free. Caring for the kid yourself is free. Gets more expensive to eat out when the kid starts eating solid food, but it's a good motivator to stop eating out.\n\nBiggest expenses turned out to be speech therapy and school. I'd say you easily hit that 13k if you're doing private school. Otherwise most of the expenses are stuff you'd be spending money on already.
The books or the guns? XD
You see it happen to famous people all the time. They get worshipped to the point they think they are gods, so they start delivering commandments from on high. And even if they aren't part of the "pizza" problem, they are surrounded by leftists, all of which think everyone thinks like them. It doesn't help that UK has the notorious "Shy Tory" effect where conservatives typically shut up about politics unless in a specifically political situation, so just as in the US, libs have free reign to act as if they are the only opinion out there.\n\nI suppose I'd hoped JKR was normal enough to be immune to the godhood syndrome, so add me to the list of the disappointed. If we follow the typical "stardom" path, I suppose next week we'll learn she's got a hidden drug problem or something...
Well, to be fair, the guys freaking out most likely didn't vote for him.\n\nI feel like I should be opening a popcorn store with all the crazy out there to observe lately. And it's only going to get better methinks.
A bit embellished don't you think? XD
It's really stupid. So far all the executive orders have been either about enforcing existing law (immigration) or clearing the way for things congress and CoS want to do already (such as "drain the swamp" or repealing Obamacare). Trump isn't overhauling anything, he's simply clearing the path for the law to be followed and removing all the roadblocks. 
For the whale sized sjw
The world needs a LOT more based teachers.
Keep in mind that a lot did. In my particular case, it's not like I disliked either, but was choosing among favorites. I honestly think Cruz can do more good by staying in congress though, and the CoS guys are still ramping up support.\n\nNever sick of winning. Especially as it looks like the conservatives have finally found their voices again and are making the media eat a daily helping of crow. This will be the most FUN presidency ever.
Oh man.... I never thought of that. The next 8 years are gonna be goooooooooood.
I think you just beat everyone else to it. :)
Saw that myself. Yay for capitalism!
My fave chic-fil-a would be the club.... A chicken, cheese, and bacon sandwich!
That should be their right. I don't have to LIKE what another person is doing with their own business, while minding their own business. And why the heck would I want to give the KKK my money?\n\nOr how about Starbucks? They don't want my business? Fine. I don't want theirs either. Freedom of association. What about other liberal restaurants or hangouts where they have made it clear conservatives aren't welcome?\n\nThe thing is, rules only work if they apply to everyone. You cannot have freedom of speech and association and simultaneously force people to associate or do business against their will. The two situations are not compatible. One has to go, and I sure as heck hope it isn't freedom of speech and association. People forget that the real problem with Jim Crow was that it was government required and enforced. Trying to "fix" it by forcing people on each other opened a can of worms that has resulted in the PC hellhole we are barely fighting off today.\n\nThis has nothing to do with Christians imposing their own rules on everyone else. It has EVERYTHING to do with them wanting to be left in peace on their own time and property. Or should we try force feeding bacon to Jews and Muslims to cure them of their seemingly backward ways? Or force a Hindu to eat a steak?
Aw man... That makes it worse. Hopefully the person will think about how their actions affect others from here on.
I'm not convinced that Starbucks will get away with it either. What a lot of people forget is that coffee shops like to set themselves up near churches to catch the people hanging out after church. This includes Starbucks. Oh, and the libs they were pandering to think they're the ultimate evil. Honestly they get boycotted every other week.\n\nThey may not go out of business, but they'll feel this one.
Ironically, CNN released the real picture.\n\nhttp://edition.cnn.com/interactive/2017/01/politics/trump-inauguration-gigapixel/
Can't say I got any hints about the local foodservice where I am at, but a local Amusement Park owner put up a Trump billboard here in New Mexico.
Starbucks PR people in this thread can take a hike. I'm not going to go all sour grapes over this: I actually liked your damn drinks and those egg bites were an utterly delish low-carb treat that I couldn't get enough of. But now? If you really want to PR here, you can get your suits to apologize. Apologize for your obvious slap in the face to American lives and safety. Apologize for your insistence that those who think differently from you are "not welcome". You don't see Chick-fil-a pulling crap like that. Those who think differently are welcome as employees and customers.\n\nDon't worry. Apologizing to non-sjws is safe. We're waiting. But you sure as hell better say it like you mean it.\n\nIn the meantime, I'll go to Satellite/Flying Star and will give these Black Rifle guys a try once they have product to sell again.
And make popcorn
Looks more like they're pushing to share it with purple-haired SJWs.\n\nDon't get me wrong...both are rotten.
It's raining red pills!
But I've sworn off donuts... :(\n\nI've been making my own coffee drinks lately. 
Can this year possibly get anymore entertaining?
Welp... I would have hoped that as the guy who wrote the intro to "SJWs always lie", the guy would have put up more of a fight. But he resigned, allowing the SJWs to win. An example has been made.\n\nAn honest mistake. Now let's get revenge by blowing pizzagate wide open!
Hey now, no Kellogg's.
This could get very long...
Yeah, this hardly seems like a fair fight...
Sounds like the Tea Parties actually.
This is why we currently have a group working on an Article 5 convention of states. The states have the power to go over Congress's head. It's a section of the constitution that has never been used, because in the past, congress stepped in, did the amendment anyway, then took the credit. Problem is it is doubtful they'd do this on the subject of their own term limits.  
Iol was worried it was going to be a video of me on my bike!
The way twitter's been going lately, it wouldn't surprise me if Trump couldn't see half the tweets aimed at him.\n\nAside from that, he's very active and vocal. So this accusation is stupid.
Yeah, but in a way it was more fun seeing them implode with no effort on our part.
There won't be any terrorist attacks for a while. Public support for the immigration policy is already around 55%. A hostile act would push that up at least another 10%
That sounds like an awful lot for 21 days.  Remember you'll likely be tired after the wedding, so maybe choose two or three regions and work from there
Lived in HK for a while in my 20's, moved to London and now in Singapore in my 30's. Overall I'd say the lifestyle in Singapore is the pick of the bunch, and especially compared to HK. And especially with kids. \n\nMaybe generalising a bit but HK is party central, whereas Singapore is a bit quieter - especially during the week. I see a lot more people outside in Singapore running and enjoying the outdoor space than I ever did in HK. \n\nThe main downside is the size, it's a smallish island so does feel a bit suffocating at times. But Changi airport is easy to get to and can have you on a flight to Indonesia, Malaysia or Thailand in no time at all when you need a break
Kuala Lumpur. A sprawling mass of a city, dirty, freeways everywhere. Constantly trying not to get ripped off. And something just doesn't feel right about the place

Not so much porno, more porn related but I do a lot of running around singapore, including a lot of the tourist sights. Earlier in the mornings there can be a lot of younger ladies having professional photos taken, say along the river.

Australian from Sydney, have called Singapore home for the last seven years. If you want to get ahead in life it's a great place, taxes are low and it offers easy travel throughout Asia. Career wise it can also be a very good move, as it's a 'hub' for banks, aviation, legal and many other industries. Lifestyle wise it's a great melting pot if Chinese, Asian, Malay, Indian & western cultures. \n\nThe cost of living really depends on your lifestyle. If you're out drinking at Clarke quay most nights it could run into the thousands. Or you can eat and drink and local places and save a fortune. It also depends what other financial commitments you have. \n\nDM me if you want any other details, and good luck with the decision making

Magnificent. Saw it from a plane once, from NZ to Singapore. The pilot came on to announce we could see it out the right window, did a bank to the right shortly afterwards and we had an awesome view.

Yes sorry, 1gbps. It's a bit more pricey than some other providers, but we regularly get 300mbps up and down, even when running a dual band and with lots of other interference including baby monitors around. 
They definitely go out of their way at this place for the full Japanese experience, Ramen smiley face included. They also have Japanese pop music playing, a selection of Japanese comic books (manga?) to read through, and Kirin on tap.  \n\nAND it's located at Boat Quay, which is the main after work drinking area in the Singapore CBD. Five stars.

A bit of a side note, I love running but lately have been having trouble with my heel. I got a bike which is turning out great, less stress impact and am feeling the difference when running.

The South Island of NZ has a population of around a million, and it's biggest city Christchurch is around 400k of that.

Keep up the great work! A few years back I was quite unfit, went out for a "trial" run with my wife and struggled to run a few hundred metres. That has increased over time, and it's really rewarding as your distance but also endurance improves. \n\nKeep at it! Running is one of the most rewarding activities out there, the health aspect will have you feeling much better both physically and mentally.  And as you said, sometimes the hard part is getting the running gear & shoes on and getting out there. I'm still the same sometimes, but it's an awesome experience once you get going.

Our twins from around 20 months took off with their vocabulary, and now at 26 months are regularly stringing four sentence sentences together. \n\nI found it helps to talk to them as I would an adult, so not repeating their baby talk back to them which can be confusing. If they say a word say it back to them very clearly, which helps them practice in their mind and speaking the word. \n\nLastly we now listen to old videos of them, and realise they had a lot more words when they were younger than we realised - they just weren't very clear yet so we weren't picking them up. 
Not Another Teen Movie has the answer 
Can't think of any regular weekend shows, but check sistic regularly as there will be visiting or local comedians performing at places such as the Kallang or Star Theatres
What the fuck was on that floor to make it so slippery?
So far only the crowne plaza. You do get a good view of the airport though, it's located in between the two runways. \n\nThe nearest alternatives are at Changi business park where you might see some planes on approach, but still some distance away\n\nIf you're in the area near the airport have a drink at Myra's Beach Club (along East Coast Park) or Changi village hawker - both will offer great pics of planes on final approach, depending on which way the traffic is flowing \n\n[edit] additional advice

It's fucking scary what your phone can learn about you, from daily habits at known wifi locations, as well as GPS and mobile data identification. \n\nLook trough the ads on your Facebook or google - there's a good chance they follow a pattern of where they expect you to be at that point during the day. Approaching lunchtime? - here's an ad for a local restaurant etc. \n\nSlightly more unhinging for me is them tracking who you're with - so not only do they know you're at that restaurant, but if you're going with a regular group of friends there's a good chance they know WHO ELSE you're there with, and can then start sending advertisements to you as a group. \n\nI turn off all location services wherever possible. Zynga and supercell DO NOT need to know where I am throughout the day!

Yes I did think of that, luckily it was only Singapore -KL which is a 30 minute hop, paid for by work.  KL airport was almost empty on the way in and out. \n\nIn all seriousness, I do hope they find mh370 at some point, for at least a bit of closure for anyone with loved ones that were on board.

Its just so beautiful. The contrast in b&w film is unmatched in digital, the grain makes it feel so alive and warm. And the best part to me is the accomplished feeling you get after you do the whole process of shooting, developing and printing.\n\nThe price thing does suck, but I'd argue quality over quanity on the capacity of the camera. I only have 36 shots per roll. Better make them count

The only irresistible impulse is the one you don't resist.
Sexual maturity biologically has zero relevance on how retarded young teens are mentally. That's why sexual manipulation leading to exploitation via "grooming" is a thing and so easy to do on a dumb kid. Jfc, even in your late teens and early 20s you're fucking retarded no matter how "intelligent" you are when it comes to experience, wisdom, and being vulnerable to emotional manipulation. Don't care how "mature" you thought you were nor you're experiences at that age, looking back we all  come to realize ust how fucking stupid we were back then.

I'm not going to be able to agree with you, man. Just leave it at that.
because if they held their same positions, they'd probably be considered skinhead punks by today's standards
i have a hard time with this because while i agree, someone who can't resist the sexual advances of a pupil regardless of age shouldn't be teaching, i also struggle with what *is* an acceptable age of consent or what is an acceptable age gap.\n\nonce you are fully sexually developed, which varies, where do you draw the line, seriously? it's arbitrary like anything else and generally dictated by social norms. Up until 2008 Canada had an age of consent(AOC) of 14, and many countries have similar AOC or even lower anywhere from 9-21. Now, obviously 9(clearly pedophilia) is ridiculous as is 21(wtf ya prudes), but post puberty, where do you draw the line? is a 21 or even a 28 year old too old for a 13 year old? i honestly can't say, because personally, when i was 13, i believe i would have been able to consent, i was definitely masturbating and fantasizing of hot teachers/friends moms at 13.\n\nanyone who abuses their position of power to take advantage of a person regardless of age is sick, but if someone is sexually mature and believes they can consent i have a hard time saying they are wrong, I'm not them. It's not like drinking/drugs, that will for sure have a detrimental effect on physical development, it's not like driving or military service where ability to carry heavy loads or manipulate controls is critical. I would liken it more to voting, when is someone capable of making an informed decision? it can have an immediate effect, which is positive or negative based on perspective, and it can have a long term effect which is also + or - based on perspective.\n\nthe male brain doesn't fully finish developing into our mid 20's, do we say you can't make a decision on your own until then?\n\nidk, sorry for the long rant, been forced to confront this issue a lot today, just trying to hash it out myself.\n\nspezit: id like to say that I'm basically fine with the current laws in america, thought there is an argument to be made for it to be lowered to 16. Also, i do think 20+ dating under 16-17 gets weird because of the major differences between general maturity levels, but that gets back into the fact mental development isn't finished until mid 20's and we can all agree that'd bee an absurd AOC\n 
I posted this on twitter
Honestly I'm going to defend Milo, sometimes I have half baked ideas that aren't a core belief, but I need to talk about them to have other input. Milo got destroyed for stepping into the ring of discourse. He did eventually agree 18 is the right age for consent after debate.\n\nI will attack Maher here because in his peace he's obviously put a lot of thought into this and is confident enough that "men can't be raped" that it indicates he's had this discussion before and wasn't open to having his mind changed.
I'm not aware of laws offering parent's much of any say.  With criminal laws, it's basically up to the prosecutor.  Now, the parents can stay hush hush and the prosecutor may not ever find out there was even a crime, but beyond that the only other say they have is if the prosecutor asks for their input.\n
A lot of the people that were in the big punk groups back in the day seem like giant pussies now. 
There was an episode on "The Detour" that portrays the age of consent pretty hilariously. Show makes me laugh 
This is what blows my mind.  Milo actually just stated THEIR POSITION on consent.  I mean, not even - fucking Lena Dunham diddled her sister and is touted as a brace woman or some such nonsense. I think this is all fucked up, and I don't agree with any of it, but to have this be a huge media shitstorm and milo gets buried by it is just a bit too transparent for me not to see right through. 
Maher may swing to the left but he isnt a SJW and hates PC culture as much as anyone. I can stand people on the left so long as they are honest, which Maher is.
Even if he's not based I fucking love black flag so much I don't care if my political views aren't the same as his
"How can a women rape a man" he says. I feel like he is just projecting his own fantasy's tbh he feels like a women with a child wouldn't do much harm but it does and especially in this case where she had 2 kids when he was 14
The medias power is no joke. Milo loses everything he worked for because the media collectively attacked him. Maher and Takei? Pfft they wont lose a single thing because the media will ignore it
Rollins used to be based.
3 bricks pls
Kennedy tho 😘
Holy fuck. This is massive! This needs to be upvoted more
Pedophilia is pedophila regardless if you're a man or a woman. If the person is under the age of 18 they qualify as a child.
I think 16 is too young. I honestly think society would be better served by insisting that those above the age of majority restrain themselves to interaction with other majority-aged adults and minors interact with minors in such situations. I can't for the life of me imagine my being OK with my daughter or son being put at great emotional and physical risk in a 'relationship' with someone adult.\n\nYou got kids? How far are you willing to traipse down your road at their expense? I think we have firmly established how utterly immature modern youths are, even into college-age. We've all seen the fine examples of maturity in the last year of college-aged students who don't seem to have a grasp on the real world. Why should selfish adults be allowed to skirt the line surrounding the subject of immaturity. It's only for the creep-adult's personal sexual or power gratification. And to suggest that an adult in a relationship with a child is all there, mentally, is a big stretch. We as humans need to examine the effects of our own do-goodisms. Often more harm than good.
That's not good. I've seen those numbers, and I don't agree with them. That's really all there is to it. I get that people are going to do what they're going to do, but I don't have to condone it or agree with it. That's just me.
Can Milo post this on his site?
Woah
> but what about a 15 and 13 year old, or a 18 and 16/17 year old\n\nThat's not at all relevant to this discussion and should be obvious why it's not. \n\n20 and 16yo sure, similar instances can be debated but it all comes down to having to draw a line somewhere. Age of consent should be with "grooming" in mind. We all know a 21yo can be a complete retard emotionally/maturity-wise while a 15yo can be wise beyond their years. It's a generally speaking law because taking every single case based individually is far too much to ask.
The conversation about age of consent and what's appropriate is pretty unproductive.  The real conversation that should be taking place is that Bill Maher has absolutely zero principles or convictions.  \n  \n  \n  This is irrefutable proof that he pounced on a conservative and had him absolutely destroyed, for merely sharing an opinion that Maher himself AGREED WITH.  \n  \n  \n  That is not ok.  That is WAY WORSE than whatever 14 or 15 year old boy, girl, or xir-whatever gets fucked by whoever, wherever.  Because all of those are going to boil down to unique individual circumstances.  \n  \n  \n  This, however, is a person who ignores what little excuse for thought and ideation swim around in his smug little fucking head, and crucifies a man who came as a guest on his show for saying something nearly identical to what he himself said on his own show, ridiculing all his other then-panel guests for disagreeing and getting zero blowback.  \n  \n  \n  Moral of the story, nothing matters if you're a liberal, and nothing is ok if you're conservative.  This is what Maher actually believes, as evidenced here today.
The current laws in America vary state by state, but in most states it is already 16 (regardless of the age of the older partner) and often younger if the partner is close in age.
Dude Henry Rollins does not age? 
Not the least bit surprising.  Maher has been a grade A slimebag for decades.
Hollywood all stood by Roman Pedo Polaski who pled guilty to drugging and raping a 13 year old then skipped the country to avoid prison. He is currently trying to get back into the US after avoiding extradition for decades. 
i also think there is a double standard when it comes to young boys and older women and milo kind of fell into that trap.
To be fair amazon didn't drop it, it was the publisher. So if the publisher doesn't print it amazon can't sell it.
I was 14 once too and knew about the birds, the bees and the resulting consequences but still would of hit that anyway 
bill maher is one personality I would like to see taken down a notch.
Sorry. I was speaking on her behalf, not his. I probably would have too.
i kind of view it like the drug war. you are not going to stop kids from experimenting. so what do we do, i think first a foremost parents need to talk to their kids and explain sex, sexuality, and lay down ground rules. i don't think we should be putting 18yr olds on the RSO list because they screwed around with a 16 year old. and i generally agree with people sticking to their peers while young, but if my daughter was 16 and was in a relationship with a 20-24 year old i would have a hard time telling her not to be in the relationship in large part because at that age they really are going to do what they want, i know i did, but it would depend on the circumstance, and i would make clear to both of them the consequences and troubles of sexual activity that young. i personally wouldn't want to date a 16 yr old myself (27) but thats because of the gap in maturity, and life experience. i had some guy and girlfriends that at 16 could have passed for 25, dudes with full beards and girls that seemed to be fully grown, women do in general fully mature before men though both physically and mentally. 
Not only does he defend statutory rape, but he doesn't think that a woman can commit rape on a man.  Holy hell!  Libs would lose their collective minds if they saw this (they wouldn't, they would defend him).  
Where, in that statement, has he explicitly said that the age of consent should be changed? Look at the press conference Milo had recently, that'll put a lot of things straight. 
Words of wisdom, right there.
No, no we aren't. The woman was well over twice his age. That is disgusting. He is a child and going through puberty. Do you seriously think he has sat down and thought about the aftermath? 
Milo did the exact same thing in the infamous tape. He said that age of consent laws should be changed so that women teachers who are tempted by "nubile young boys" don't get in trouble. \n\n>“I’ve never said this publicly… but we’re talking about 13/25, 13/28 (year olds), these things do happen perfectly consensually. Often, and by the way it is the women who are suffering this, what normally happens in schools is that it’s an older woman with a younger boy, and the boy is the predator in that situation. The boy is like, “let’s see if I can fuck the gym teacher,” or “let’s see if I can fuck the hot maths teacher,” and he does. The women fall in love with these nubile young men, these athletic young boys in their prime, and end up having their lives destroyed. They end up having to move schools, move country or whatever.”

You know you can embed the timing into the link so when someone clicks the link it takes them to the spot you want them to see. :-)
i agree and i understand the 'grooming' aspect but, the question is where do we draw the line? it can't be into the mid 20's and i don't think an 18+ year old should be having sex with an 13 year old. but what about a 15 and 13 year old, or a 18 and 16/17 year old. we have laws that can sort of accommodate that with parental consent, but it varies, and it leaves young consenting similarly aged couples open to possible prosecution. there are numerous examples of kids sexting or having sex and being prosecuted.\n\nlook, most of us have probably fooled around sexually at ages *technically* illegal just like many of us drank/did drugs/smoked cigs, but we as a society have to just be honest about it and not necessarily freak out at the sexuality of sexually mature people without taking into consideration the circumstances and opinions of those involved. 
Should really look around during at age of consent in the states, they range from 14-18 in the states and in Europe they are usually in the lower range.
Yeah I'm going to have to strongly condemn both Milo and Maher over that type of reasoning. The teachers job is to teach not have sex with teens. If they can't resist the sexual advances of a teen student they shouldn't be a teacher of teens at all. End of story.\n\nJust because attraction between teen boys and women in their 20's is possible doesn't mean it should be encouraged or allowed. Learning sexual restraint is a huge part of socializing teens to have the ability to delay gratification in other areas of life. Teens being off limits to adults for sex is a taboo worth conserving for many reasons.
Got him!
Starts at 7:05 Mark\n\nSupposedly the 14 year old boy impregnated her twice. Bill Defends it. He even points out the boy was younger when their relationship started
Dont worry.  Youre stupid now.  Just ask youself in 5 years how dumb you were.  
You draw the line at clear demarcations of life experience... Children interact with children and adults interact with adults. You seem to be making some case for some adults predating children under the auspices of "how could we know?" And that's just gross. Could you get away with that reasoning when discussing cornholing a dog?\n\n
I only condemn the reasoning in the above Milo quote. Overall I mostly agree with Milo's position that he clarified in today's press conference.
Maher is a dipshit.  Thinks he's all cool when he talks about himself smoking weed.  
Bill Maher's production company used to be named KID/LOVE now it's been changed to BILL/MAHER but it's the same general logo. I wonder....
Lad
I agree. To me it boils down to sexual exploitation. The woman is taking advantage of the teenager, who she knows won't turn her down.
We all say that it is fucked up but deep down inside we are saying he was a lucky bastard too
Where is the media outrage?
It's time we begin fully dismantling the media, as they have now organized to a point where they are a threat to all Americans. \n\nThe First Amendment allows for freedom of the press, but in the same way the Second Amendment doesn't allow for a citizen to own a nuke, the First Amendment doesn't allow for the manipulating media in the current form. 
The boy was 12 years old when the sexual relationship started.  By 14, he had 2 kids with her.
This is nowhere near as hard a call as you make it out to be.... Adults fuck and romance other adults and fucking well leave kids to stay kids for as long as childhood lasts. Childhood is a time-limited resource. How selfish does this bitch have to be to erase part of his natural claim to childhood innocence? What is SO hard about getting your head around that idea...? Adults who take refuge in sexual or romantic relationships with children have massive emotional problems borne of their own insecurity and inability to deal with adults their own age, on adult terms. Make no mistake, most adults could manipulate children and teens in the paradigm of a private sexual or romantic relationship. No one, and I mean NO ONE, who is under 20 has the requisite life experience to roll with adults in the hay. Nor can they expected to act in their own best interests when an adult is potentially gaslighting them.\n\nI think the gaslighting is a very prevalent facet of age-disparate relationships, namely those with grown adults influencing inexperienced children.\n\nPlease take the time to imagine these two chatting about their day while preparing dinner together... If the conversational subject matter of a 14 year old is sufficient intellectual stimulation for the adult in this situation, how pathetic is THAT!!!? Hint: COMPLETELY pathetic.\n
That's not fair, you can't remove something they didn't have to begin with anyways. What a sham of a pledge.
It's even worse when they keep an ongoing relationship. It's one thing if it's a one off thing that they regret after the fact. It's absolutely disgusting when they keep it going for months or even years.
Reminds me of the South Park episode. Ike and the teacher. Niiiiice...
The brain isn't fully developed by 16, heck it isn't until your early 20s. That accounts for a lot of the stupid decisions that teens and young adults make. The thing is, that the average teen or young adult who is sexually active tends to stick with people their own age. \n\nThere are lots of people who end up having these types of relationships with people who have power over them (e.g., teachers) who end up having tons of  psychological issues after the fact regardless of consent. 
Yup, embedded with them for a gunnery in Korea, it was amazing gunnery, even setting the plate at first with that first round. They let me drop a few down the tube. One of my most cherished memories.
Tried to buy, but says not available. Anyone know where else we can get the album?
if you're in the country illegally, the crime is ongoing. the crime doesn't stop at just entering, but still trespassing.
You mean the hillary subs? Because that place was nothing but one sided circle jerking. Anything posted supporting trump was promptly deleted. That's not how a default sub should be run.
And that's the sad part about multiplayer servers and the packs that basically require dimension building, usually that ability is banned to help with server peeformance.

Dammit mark Hamill, STFU before star wars gets nuked from orbit :(
Just my thought, interesting they left a note instead of said g it to their face. No balls on that one. God this makes my blood boil.
doesnt matter what their culture is at home or how they were raised. the law here states that it is illegal to do so. anyone care to explain about all the arrests of foreigners in saudi arabia that have drank, or gone out without men escorts. or anything of the sort? that is some major bullshit.
I do t agree with the light sentences as long as it's proven it was rape, but you mention a few cases. Well a few cases do not a culture make. I would assume a rape culture is a culture where rape is condoned, allowed in certain instances and so on. Not the definition of what's trying to be peddled.
quite a few of those things are not rights. they are privileges.  and your male college athlete right is not even a right. jesus.
Thank you for the link, when I searched for her last night there was no results and my amazon kept changing from music to regular shopping items. Supporting our pedes!
child pornography? industrial espionage? any sort of illegal data that can be used in illegal means? 
How conveniently people forget his first 2 years where the dems controlled everything. Even with full control he still had to pass the ACA through some ridiculous reconciliation BS. couldn't even get dems to support him so he had to buy every single needed dem vote. Not a single repub voted for it.
Or a domestic abuser mentality.
i think it was stated before that the DACA considers them from the age that they came in, not from when DACA was established. im no fan of the DACA but your logic doesnt take that into account.
Love this quote from the article:\n" It's not just this business or this area, it's nationwide. California, Nevada, and Chicago," Garcia adds.\n\nAs if that is even remotely "nation wide". bubbles I tell you.
Wouldn't that be up to the server admins to manage such behavior if not allowed? Pvp servers you could get a raid and demolish them. 
Let's say someone is a known local drug dealer, cops may not have something in him but through investigative procedures plenty of witnesses have pinned him. That would be reasonable for me.
how is it that they are dumped where they dont have family? you honestly think that "dreamers" dont have family in mexico? where do you think they came from when they were first brought here at a young age? did the rest of their family just disappear?
should see the unedited version, there are a few links out here in T_D. i would suggest that you hold your outrage till you see it. if you still feel the same way after watching it you did your due diligence.
Smart phones are pocket computers you can have plenty of contraband on a phone. That being said I don't agree with personal phones being searched at the border.

So both sayings you are repeqting are alleged? So not fact or able to be proved true?
There are 13 year olds that have hit puberty, it's called biology. The textbook definition is what he said. 
you're really selling "family" short from Mexican culture, doesn't look like you understand what family means to us. while it is not an ideal situation the "dreamers" are not as left out in the cold as you make it seem.
And you have no understanding of what or how are government is set up. This country is not a pure democracy, the 51 percent can't abuse the 49. It's a constitutional republic. Where the states that are part of that republic are represented. 
look into whatever you can do right now, get the ball rolling, dont lag behind.
I'm currently playing project ozone 2 reloaded in kappa mode, which is harder than infinity evolved expert mode. I've been playing it for a few weeks now and are nowhere near the end, probably not even middle of the pack. Loving it.
Dat website though, sheesh  not 20 seconds  later I need to call a number because my phone is infected...
No kidding, I went with the portable player and the home stereo. Hype ftw.
Guess you'd like to starve then, more power to you.
While I agree when used by corrupt cops it's bullsbit, the original idea has meritd. But as usual when abused it turns to shit.
confirmed, i have OVER 50 cousins and ive been here since i was 9. 
I did the same, was quite surprised to get such garbage in my email, ranked right up there with how many people want to see my penis enlarged wether through pills or some sort of newfound technique.
You forgot biologically, oh wait...not defending pedophilia but he gave the textbook definition of a pedophile. 
But when you say "it's basically marry an American" my initial point still stands it's there. I never claimed it was easy. And I agree with your view on the law.
So did that statute ever apply to President Obama when he held a title at the UN? it's never been a requirement for anyone running for office to disclose tax returns. If that's an issue change the rules to require it. Can't sit there and accuse someone oder breaking a requirement/rule that doesn't exist.
try searching for tvaddons.org its got all you need to get started.
no kidding, id like some sort of immunity from getting arrested. must be nice.
the hypocrisy knows no bounds...
Hey, guess where those 300k people you don't like go after the sub goes poof? It will just spread to the whole site. I never understood why people don't see the repercussions of banning the sub.
 wasnt he the guy revealing a bunch of secret info to ukraininan pranksters? this guy has no room to talk.
not sure why you're getting down-voted, its the truth, its a matter of personal responsibility for many of us. and it should not be subsidized by the federal government.
he chaired the UN security council. its clear that the president should not hold any other postions of power from any other political organization.
I noticed your posts, and not good for to lie they looked very concerned trolling, it'd always good to not have knee jerking reaction to media, after all we should know better by bow to not blindly trust them. Hope you did your own digging and came up with your own view of the subject. \n\n
you usually have to apply at the country of origin, at the US embassy. follow the legal path through there. eventually it will lead to being allowed to come into the US THEN the rest of the process continues. its why legal immigrants like myself dislike illegal immigration, its a lengthy process and we hate the fact that people skip the lines with the DACA Bs.
Keep calling it what it isn't, the EO has no religious wording in it at all. 
He's not staying at the white house because he's not the president yet, not to mention the white house/oval office is getting renovated because it was put off by the current president. You may be thinking about his wife and his youngest son Bannon but that's due to not wanting to interrupt his kids studies. And as his business interests go he's already mentioned that he's stepping away from it, he's reiterated that by law he doesn't have to. But he's going to. He's said it already but will have a formal press conference today on that sibject.
You mean like the politics sub or many other subs that outright ban you just for posting in specific subs? 
The contact is not why he resigned, it's that he lied to the vice president. Similar to how bill Clinton was impeached not for getting a bj at the white house but for lying about it.
Look back on the transcript, he did not lump all Mexicans into the comment, it's about a small fraction of illegal immigrants. There are papers/studies our there that show a very high chance of sexual assaults being possible on females that are trying to make the trek north. Hell I'm mexican and even if can understand that his comment was taken out of context. Your 21st century standards are a little skewed.
Had some mortar men infantry assigned to our troop back in the day, permanent resident here 19D back then. Really need to get my paperwork in. Lol. Had a blast rolling with them from time to time, literally 120mm mortars are amazing.
correct, but can a dreamer apply for residency or some sort of visa to stay here legally? im going to go out on a limb here and say yes, there may be a path. may not be easy, or cheap. but im sure its there.
yea, you took the words right out of my mouth, apparently the shitty service needed to get fired anyways for providing shitty service..
i am against gut feeling forfeitures, i don't agree with them and they get my blood boiling, but any assets from verified drug dealers/kingpins and so on should be seized. the forfeiture laws/regulations should be strictly overseen, to prevent abuse. there should not be any red tape that a lawful person should have to fight to get their property back.
Spot on observation, I noticed in the interview that he kept trying to get a complete thought in before bill would cut him off, you are/where a 19D perhaps?
Had that happen to me with takei poll. Something shady going on.
The press conference itself.
Just being brigaded, your comment was not misconstrued. Don't worry about imaginary Internet points.
Lol not sure wether to agree with you or disagree. It is genius the way he handled the media, and they still don't get it. He laid it out years ago in his book. it should not have come as a surprise to anyone his style of speaking/dealing with media. And to your second point, the guy is not even in office yet, can you even give him the benefit of the doubt? He genuinely looks like he's got this country's well being in mind. 
is this related to the top posts from 3 different anti trump reddits about how its confirmed that trump aides had ties to russia? which i think is BS.
Sadly that's the only place I've seen where you can defend trump without being called a racist homophobic xenophobic person. Even if you're a black gay woman from another country any other place just gets you brqnded.
and theres nothing wrong with that, his opinion is his to have and not many agree with it. but there is no doubt this is a targeted hit. 
MAybe set up the protest on the weekend? A holiday? Sometime you wouldn't be forced to miss work? 
Doesn't that seem counter productive? They intelligence communities leaking information in response for someone leaking information? Flynn discussed sanctions, big whoop, he can't do anything about them without the administration. He resigned for lying to the VP and the VPN was shamed for going to bat for him. 
im not sure if intentionally being dense, staying in country is still against the law. reporting has nothing to do with it. if you get caught withing the borders and you dont have proper documentation, its against the law. hence committing a crime.
The crime is entering the country illegally, failure to register is something else on top of that, so yes he's been breaking the  law for 40 years. Even though 24 isn't acceptable either.
it doesn't conflict, i consider myself pro life and believe the unborn are innocent have done no wrong. while capital punishment is there for those that have done something so bad possibly taken a life that they have forfeited the right to live. 
people dont just belong to one sub, to think that people only stick to one sub at all is absurd.
Lol really? Conservatives are the ones that only care about identity politics? Enjoy the next 8 years.
Yet he's still the president, not sure why it's so hard to understand that we are a constitutional republic, not a pure democracy. It's based on the states that make up the "United States" majority of counties went to trump. But if it makes people feel better to keep looking at the popular vote  go for it, at the end of the day the electoral college did what it was supposed to do.
He did resign, of hospital own volition.
one of the biggest reasons "anti-abortionists" cite is the eradication of the black race due to abortions. and the stats behind it are appalling. there is no racism in that. and i think its disingenuous to inject race into the topic.
i know what you mean, ive been to family parties where eventually the drinking conversation has drifted towards the president (back then was just the republican candidate) got tired of hearing the misinformation flowing around that eventually i just came out and defended el presidente. hell, even my own family, my mother is scared that she is going to get deported and snatched at the border. never mind that shes a permanent legal resident. ive had to calm them down on how irrational it sounds.  the fear that univision, telemundo and some of the radio stations they listen to put out is sickening.\n\nedit: "put out"
sorry, dont agree with you, whats good for the cook is good for the gander. get that douche out of here! bill maher is a hypocrite, especially for trying to take credit for milo.
basically, their premise is that when they were young they had no choice in coming here illegally.
dont think that was yelp, it was the food delivery company, i forget its name.
Clinton. Didn't win shit, thE US is a republic, the majority of STATES decided on trump.
I'm in a similar boat, been here over 25 years have served in the military, actually qualify under a few requirements. But geeze that n400 registration is expensive. Though like you, I do feel the time is near to take that final jump. To be fair I've felt more American than some Americans these days for a very long time.  Godspeed to you fellow immigrant!  MAGA.
Don't need to imagine it, I live it lol sigue la pelea mi amigo  cienpies
Interestingly enough there is no Muslim ban. Keep calling it what it isnt, nice obfuscation.
Didn't compare him to bill hicks, it was some other comedian. And no they wouldn't let him finish anything he wanted to say.
Being a cog in the machine is what keeps your family fed, can't raise a family on hopes and dreams, need a bit of work in there somewhere.
i was not aware. thank you for the clarification. 
Hmm, that's good to hear. I was hoping it wouldn't take as long as te green card process. Not OP but in similar situation.
spread it far and wide pedes! id love to see this douche eat his words like he usually does!
Dammit, fell for the shitpost again, lol good one.
my stance is that there are many contraceptives out there that are available to prevent the pregnancy, the easy access to abortions cause people to take risks that they shouldn't have taken in the first place. personal responsibility. 
So basically a bunch of openly gay threads where t_d users  are supportive or accepting.  \n\nTLDR: the comments above stating t_d is a Trans hate sub are bullsbit

That's a sub? but free speech is banned? This site is fucked
You used an ellipses to leave out the very important quote which completely disproves your argument.\n\nTrump: "Yeah, that's her -- with the gold.... I’ve gotta use some Tic-Tacs, just in case I start kissing her. You know I’m automatically attracted to beautiful — I just start kissing them. It’s like a magnet. Just kiss. **I don’t even wait. And when you’re a star, they let you do it.** You can do anything."\n\nTo further illustrate:\n\nTrump: **"I moved on her and I failed.** I'll admit it. I did **try** and fuck her. She was married."
Affirmative action. You can get hired while being under skilled, just for being a minority.\n \nCollege? You can get into top schools with SAT scores half that of Asian Americans.
Probably a BMI calculator.
I'm literally the same as you, bros. I still treat everyone the same, until they give me a reason not to. What race someone is doesn't even play into my mind when meeting/interacting with them. I'm more interested in their character. But leftists love to bring up race straight away. Who's the racists again?
Thanks. I'll check it out!
How long ago? I'm surprised it didn't get more coverage on this sub.
If you look into this his voice shouldn't be heard anywhere is indeed the message.

Everyone not in LA and SF, yes. Everyone who grows your food. California is full of farm land and forests. You wouldn't know because you live in a bubble. There are many Trump supporters around you, though. We are the silent majority in this country. We are like a secret society in California because we have no free speech here. When you see an alpha male or an attractive female, they are a Trump supporter.
Incurring more debt than all previous presidents combined, what a legacy.
**GOP**\n\nLook at all the state  senates voting to ban sanctuary cities. You lose, you're fired!
Perhaps the most qualified people for the job are working there. Would you rather hire people because of their skin color? And if so, how is that not racist?\n\nThat's a fact. Asian Americans are under extreme pressure to compete and held to the highest standards by many top colleges. They're required to have top SAT scores just to compete. I think this is racist in itself.\n\nI'd honestly like your opinions on this because there is no dissenting discussion on this sub anymore. It'd be nice to have a discussion that isn't personal attacks and vindictive down votes.
I never knew he was so tall!
I'm not sure what recordings you're referring to. I'm assuming press conferences and President Trumps own comments on EO's?\n\nHe doesn't have to claim it. By that logic, Hillary never claimed that her leaked emails were faked/manipulated.\n\nI was referring to the most publicized recording, the "grab them by the pussy." This was taken completely out of context. If more people had actually bothered to listen to the entire conversation this would be widely known. Whether you are male or female, I've heard both genders discuss this same type of "locker room talk." Anyone who says they never have are either lying or in an extreme minority. This is the biggest example of the media cooking up this projected outrage towards the President. I'm not saying he's undeserving of criticism, but there is so much misinformation being spread by MSM, the  internet, and social media, etc. The likes of which have never been seen towards any other U.S. President. And I don't know what the consequences will be.

Recordings can't be taken out of context?
I feel you. You should check out Mastodon since you like prog rock they have awesome concept albums. The Ocean combines just about every genre of metal wonderfully. Underling is this really cool ambient, atmospheric, but technical/melodic band.\n\nI don't necessarily look at extreme metal like other genres. And often I don't even care what the lyrics are. It's more about the feeling invoked. I focus on different instruments and it makes it interesting to replay my favorite albums over and over.\n\nI'd have to say extreme metal gets the worst rep of any genre of music. I think if more people learned the basics of any instrument of their choosing they could appreciate it for what it is. That would stop the, "anyone can do that," "it's just noise" comments at least.
I did not. Why am I not surprised, though? KEK
Didn't Twitter refuse to shut down Isis accounts?\n\n**WTF**
EO's are not outlined in the Constitution. Which brings us to the past several years. No one cares when their side is the one writing the EO's. \nJournalists are just mouthpieces. I'm talking about the networks. 
They were / are saying disgusting things about a great man. Truly sad how ignorant and hateful they are.
**OUT, OUT, OUT**
Is it true they reuploaded it because there was over a million down votes?
Not even adventure movies , bro. Just look at the numerous translations of the Bible. Shit gets completely made up, inevitably.
Are you kidding?
No , I'll check them out!
I agree, but it's shouldn't be our job to be the world's police anymore. We need to look after our own like every other country is doing.
That's a bit of a stretch. My point is people are losing their minds over President Trump. If they had any understanding of the Constitution themselves they'd understand the President doesn't have anywhere near absolute power. Also ask yourself why any news source is reporting. Is it to make the public informed? Or is it for ratings and ultimately money?

They don't evolve. It will be glorious to watch them crumble nation by nation. I will raise a beer to you, brother and all fellow pedes.\n\nMAGA
It was the level of corruption from the Dems. It was unprecedented and disgusting. Then watching them try to cover it up, outright lies, censorship, denial of facts, this is what most influenced me to switch. I voted to stop that.
> **I am going to stop this conversation** because you are lying to make your guy look better.\n\nAnd you continue to reply. Who's the liar?
I honestly didn't expect them to double down. Well, you reap what you sow. I don't feel any pity for them.
And Obama was a community organizer, no more qualified than President Trump. Quite less qualified, actually. A great speaking leftist who pushed socialism. Sound familiar? Sounds like every dictator ever. He did "okay," because that's how democracy works. Relax, lol.
I think he was srs, bruh. lol\n\nBut my dude, you have to dig deeper. There are bands doing cool prog stuff and combining so many genres. Really talented musicians pushing boundaries even today. I love metal because it's like the last bastion for limitless creativity and ultimate freedom of speech in music.
Reality is based.
Awesome, thank you.\n\nI know A Parkway Drive isn't really classified as melodeath, but isn't Deep Blue pretty much a melodeath album?
lol! PC virtue signaling is over, you fat, vegan, feminist. Get a job
Any bands without/ very minimal cleans and a non nasally/whiny vocalist. Similar to Parkway Drive, more melodeath than metal core, I guess. Interesting drumming is a plus too.\n\nThanks, guys!
I recently ordered KWAS, I'm excited to give it a spin.
I've recently gotten into the drums. Can you guys recommend some bands with amazing drums?\n\nI'm currently listening to a Parkway Drive - Horizons

Myself. I don't know what this white privilege is  about, kek. \n\nIt's entertaining, though.

He also brings up two sides to every story and world history in context with U.S. history quite frequently.\n\nMeanwhile half the class is attacking him with emotional arguments and it's hilarious.

My main gripe with Maher is that he always surrounds himself with 2-3 other people who agree with him. They, plus the audience, then all gang up on the guest he is there to debate with. The rare occasion where Maher is one on one with the guest, you see healthy debate, but this is rare. \n\nHe is right about Islam, but then again, even a broken clock is right twice a day.
I think he still owes the the Trump Campaign a contribution check. Heck Trump is currently a candidate for the 2020 election, so Oliver could contribute any time.

From CNN:\n\nIs Warren part Native American?\n\nWarren says, yes, she is, and points to "family stories" passed down to her through generations as evidence.\n\n"I am very proud of my heritage," Warren told NPR in 2012. "These are my family stories. This is what my brothers and I were told by my mom and my dad, my mammaw and my pappaw. This is our lives. And I'm very proud of it."\n\nIn that account and others, a genealogist traced Warren's Native American heritage to the late 19th century, which, if true, would make her 1/32 Native American. (However, the legitimacy of those findings has been debated.)

So the main stream would want you to think. It's sad really 
Well my approach lately has been "not giving a fuck" I would have responded with "really with the bull shit already?" It started of kicking and screaming, but I've seen her give in 
I certainly didn't expect that to happen this year. Let alone trump having a convincing victory. What I'm saying is "if there was a pedophile ring amongst our leaders (both sides) I wouldn't be surprised."

I have mixed feelings, from Economical stand point, I think cut taxes, and gov spending. That'll help really churn the economy.

I will just say my favorite quote my father dropped on me (from\nCaddyshack)  while I was in high school. Like many young adults I went out and got a minimum wage job at a bowling alley. Pretty much in morning I would mop/vaccum/ get place ready for customers. Serve customers during shift, then clean up afterwards (late night). \n\nOne night the guy that normally cleans the bathrooms banged out. "Boss man, go clean the toilets." Now being a  privileged little prick, I was not pleased and complained to my father, thinking "I was above that shit." \n\nHe simply said "well son....the world needs ditch diggers too." I got over it and ended up cleaning the toilets, and appreciate the people that do that work 
2016 wasn't all that bad, I mean if you think about it every year has its ups and downs. I think 2013 was a pretty shitty year, but it's all perspective. I think it could have been worse, especially if you're basing it all on Trump being elected 
A liberal is someone who is open to other people's opinions...right up until they hear one
For me it's a constant struggle. The father leaving early in childhood defiantly created trust issues for her. Then throw in an abusive boyfriend in college, and she's become very guarded. When we met I saw this, and I was able to get her to put down her guard, and we've had a great time. However, she's very sensitive, and trying to be mindful of the past can be tough, and first sign of trouble she'll get upset (rightfully or not) so I've just done my best to be open and honest with her. Whether she accepts me for that is on her I guess 
Just the PC world we live in now...thanks Obama?
Lmao best comment of this thread 
RIP Harambe 
He was clearly tip-toeing around it, but the audacity to make such a claim, then follow up with examples of what people consider terrorist attacks, is ludicrous. \n\nWhat is the definition of a terrorist attack? A truck running over people? A plane crashing into a building? Maybe a bomb going off at a rave, or someone shooting people in a night club? \n\nFrom the wonderful source of google this is the definition I came up with: \n\n"Type of: act of terrorism, terrorism, terrorist act. the calculated use of violence (or the threat of violence) against civilians in order to attain goals that are political or religious or ideological in nature; this is done through intimidation or coercion or instilling fear. coup de main, surprise attack."\n\nNow I know they all weren't wearing your stereotypical "terrorist attire" but that statement just makes my blood boil. Gotta lie to yourself at times I suppose

Live with my gf now, she's looking to buy a house. Her mother has money set aside for her down payment. I can't pony up dough for down payment, and parents def don't approve of buying house before marriage.\n\nSo saving money for myself/ring (cheap one mind you) and house seems daunting in itself...we'll see how it plays out.\n\nAnd I only put about 20% towards retirement. Which is manageable, it's just saving for now like you say is the tricky part

It's absolutely ridiculous the state of abortion in our world. People like to turn it to be about rape and medical emergencies, but those make up less than 5% of abortions (probably closer to 1 or 2%). You want freedom of choice? Keep your legs closed and stop using abortion as backup contraception. 
Get this patriot a coat!
There haven't been many good commercials for years.
It's up to the state based on a code of morality to decide what deserves the death penalty or not. I don't think that groping a girl would warrant the death penalty, but murder and even rape (especially of an underage girl) could deserve such a thing. Groping an underage girl isn't a violent crime even if it could leave a psychological scar so it would make no sense to attach corporal punishment to it. Even still, many women will tell you that they fear rape more than being murdered. Should show you how serious rape is.
Not at all, but part of the liberal MO is making white people feel guilty about any atrocities that their ancestors may have committed in the remote past.

I don't venture out into the other sections of Reddit too much, but I've seen the meltdown everywhere else on the media. Quite great, but also quite annoying to see so much crying. Thankfully I have some conservatives on my news feed to offset the few cucks that pop up. 
I could care less how many people showed up and media dishonesty is nothing new at this point. \n\nIn terms of Obama, people also need to remember that the I95/I495 corridor from Baltimore to DC + North VA are all cucked. Also huge black populations in Baltimore and DC. Much easier for Obama to have a huge crowd.

Was your pledge made to be binding under sin? If not, then I don't think it's a huge deal. Drinking alcohol is not sinful unless it's done in excess. In fact it's very Catholic to enjoy a nice glass of beer, wine, or whatever alcohol (just not to drunkenness). Many saints loved alcohol, even our last pope (Benedict XVI) loves beer! \n\nIn Catholicism, the Pint, the Pipe and the Cross can all fit together ~ G.K. Chesterton

Everyone has some sort of prejudice of any and all groups of people who are different than themselves. I don't give a crap what you say. You can be friends with all sorts of people of other racial, ethnic, social, or whatever groups, that doesn't mean anything. When we see people who we don't know of a certain group that's not of our own we automatically make certain assumptions until we get to know the person. I don't think there's anything wrong with this. It's different if you treat someone like crap because of those reasons vs. treating them with dignity regardless of it.
It would take a massive change in the social mindset. However, for the government to make abortion for convenience illegal could be a possibility. I don't see why not. We're talking about almost 60 million Americans (and many more worldwide) who never had a chance at life.
South Park has always been quite liberal. It's just that liberals were attacking the establishment for years and now they are the establishment.

Buzzfeed should stick to reminding us about how much we miss 90s pop culture.
1. Tax payers shouldn't be forced to fund something that goes against their moral and religious beliefs. If people want Planned Parenthood to stay open they can fund it privately. I'm sure plenty of rich and famous liberals would be glad to donate if they care about it so much.\n\n2. How about stop using abortion as an alternative to contraception? You made your choice when you decided to allow a man to stick his penis inside of you. Any time you have sex there's a risk of pregnancy no matter how fool proof you think your contraception is. Be smarter and stop looking for your next consequence-free orgasm everywhere.\n\n3. In comparison Trump is still better than JFK, LBJ, and Bill Clinton... all Democrats. Trump is probably no worse than any other famous celebrity or rich business man. Do you really think men don't talk this way when women aren't around? Do you think they don't treat women like objects? Going out looking for their next lay? Especially those who are in "the game?" Stop being so ignorant. Sure, he shouldn't say these things, but stop applying a standard to him that you don't apply to all of your other famous heroes who are probably just as bad if not worse. 
I'd love to see how this works out.
Short of being officially declared one... Francis is a heretic of the highest proportions. A pope who pushes globalism and heterodox beliefs while chastising Catholics who follow the actual tenants of the Faith that has been passed down for 2000 years. A pope who kneels for non-Catholic ministers and the like, but NEVER kneels before the Eucharist. \n\nI truly believe that he's the fulfillment of St. Francis of Assisi's prophesy of a Destroyer Pope. Many of the prophesies of the Marian apparitions of Fatima and Akita (among others) are coming true before our eyes. And then here we are at the 100th anniversary of Fatima.\n\n"The work of the devil will infiltrate even into the Church in such a way that one will see cardinals opposing cardinals, and bishops against other bishops. The priests who venerate me will be scorned and opposed by their Confreres. The Church and altars will be vandalized. The Church will be full of those who accept compromises and the demon will press many priests and consecrated souls to leave the service of the Lord."
It's  a path that began at the end of WWII and has accelerated drastically in more recent years. As an example, Germans hate themselves because of the guilt put on them for what their people did over 70 years ago. This is the kind of stuff that's happening all over Europe and North America.
Either way, the crowd was massive. The weather wasn't great and most people probably had to travel far to get there. Much of Maryland, DC, and Northern Virginia are heavily Democrat areas with large black populations (who overwhelmingly supported Obama). The constant comparison between Obama and Trump in this respect is nonsensical. \n\nThe fact is that people showed up for Trump, lots of them. Trump is the President, he won and no matter how much they lie or try to attack him, he'll beat them.

From a secular standpoint he committed a crime that warrants his death and removal from earth. Justice is paid. Also, it deters others from wanting to commit the same crime.\n\nFrom a religious (Cathoic) standpoint his impending death allows him a last chance to sincerely repent to avoid the fires of hell. If he repents he still has to suffer through a long time in purgatory, but it's certainly better than hell. If he doesn't, then he goes to hell. Either way, he'll repay his debt to God.

There are plenty of cucks who have super conservative parents. It's a shame. 
The left has always been about using pleasure to brain wash the masses. Sex, drugs, booze, 24/7 entertainment, make a hedonistic society and no one will give a crap about what's going on behind the scenes. They've been working to destroy everything that civilization has been built upon for a long time. I think people are finally slowly starting to wake up and now they're coming with more vengeance.
America has always hated different people. Look back through our history, if you weren't White and Protestant, then you were considered to be a lesser person. When the Irish and Italians (among other Catholic groups) came over they were treated like crap. For Italians, it wasn't until we started to see all of these top entertainers coming in who were Italian (and had to use Americanized names--except Sinatra) that America started to accept Italians. America was never all that multicultural, it's a myth. It usually took a generation or two who grow up completely assimilated to American culture before the new group was accepted.
Trump looks bigger than everyone else. Obviously racist. 
Yeah, because that's really the same thing.

That was this year's amazing difference making catch. Not as great as some of the others, but definitely great.
If you're in the mood to read some Saints... Here's a massive book by St. Alphonsus Liguri: The History of Heresies and Their Refutation. Starting at page 138 he goes into the history of the heresies of Luther. On page 285-312 he makes a refutation of the errors of Luther and Calvin although many of their heresies are also contained in prior heresies. Definitely an interesting book that I think I'm going to spend some time looking over myself.\nhttp://tinyurl.com/hozhppp

Yep, doubling the workforce = bad news for salaries. It's elementary economics. There's a reason why we now have two workers per household and people aren't any better off than they were before.
Even in spite of this, birth control can fail or people get drunk and are too sloppy to use condoms or whatever else. Also, some women just cannot go on the pill because of health reasons, so it's condoms only. So people use abortion to "get rid of the problem." Regardless of using contraception, there is always a chance, no matter how slim that a woman will become pregnant from it. There is not one single form of birth control that is 100% effective (some say 99.9%, but that still leaves the remote possibility of that 0.1% or 1 in 1000 happening). The main function of sex is to create human life, so no matter how you stifle it, the possibility exists by the mere fact that you're having sex! If you cannot accept that possibility, no matter how remote it may be then you should not be having sex.
I'm all for getting our military of foreign countries where we have no real reason to be there. Most of these wars have no real impact on the American people. However, military R&D and training programs still need high funding no matter what. Military R&D contributes a lot to science and I think regardless of where your footprint is, having the most advanced and well trained military in the world is extremely important for national safety.

KoA: Reckoning was actually a pretty enjoyable game. The problem was that it was too MMO for a single player game (fetch quest galore) and it got repetitive after a while. The game could have been fantastic if it was designed to be a single player game from the start. I really hoped that there would have been a sequel, unfortunately it'll never happen now.

Everyone should just have to get a state issued voters ID. Drivers license shouldn't even suffice. Voters ID and that's it. That would mean that each and every person in the country would need to get one if they want to vote.

For the past couple years I've hardly watched sports. I used to watch hockey all the time, hardly have watched more than a few games in the last couple years. NFL? Maybe watched a few games during the season (watched most of the playoffs though). I'll watch Italian soccer since they're on during the day usually. Other than that, my sports watching time has been very limited.
Obviously soldiers and their families were impacted. The point is that going into Iraq was pointless to the American people. It was an awful war. All of these other conflicts that Obama has gotten involved with weren't for the good of the American people. They were for the good of his and his puppet masters' interests. Our government is sending these soldiers off to die not to help America, but to help themselves and their agendas.

Many people, even those who are highly literate, well earning, smart people don't own property and instead rent. Heck if you made it so that only land owners could vote, most people who live in cities wouldn't be able to vote (surely would eliminate a whole lot of liberals though). Renters don't pay property taxes. 
Pope Francis is the culmination of all of this. Everything since the 1960s has been a complete and utter disaster.\nA destruction of the Liturgy (if you have never been to a pre-1970 Catholic Mass, check it out, it's like a different religion -- Actually, just go here http://livemass.net/LiveMass/domingo.html), destruction of the Divine Office, suppression of devotions, bending over backwards to please non-Catholics, movements to completely destroy reverence and any semblance of the supernatural, the practical ban of preaching sin and hell, destroying the seminaries, intentionally allowing a huge influx of homosexuals (leading to the pedophilia scandals), etc..\nIt was all planned out by the same people who are destroying the rest of the society. People hate to admit it, but Catholicism stands as a pillar of morality in the Western world. Once it relaxed everything, the rest came down with it.
I know there are some Italians (from Italy) around these parts. They got hit hard as well from what I've heard.
Wouldn't say all that. 4th quarter was great. Quarters 1-3 were kinda meh.
Many of those native societies also used to practice human sacrifice and all sorts of stuff. They certainly weren't paragons of virtue and perfection that history has whitewashed them as. Another one is the Arab/Muslim slave trade which was far more horrific and longer lasting than anything that Europeans ever did.

The key is preventing the average person who wouldn't know any specific alternate news sources from finding non-mainstream news. \n\nIf a Google search either stacks the search results with liberal sites (at the minimum which is pretty much what they already do) or completely eliminate more conservative or alternative media, then that's how they will censor. \n\nSame goes for Facebook with their little news bar on the side. It may even go further by preventing conservative news from even appearing on your newsfeed regardless of if you are subscribed or a friend likes/shares it.\n\nThey can even go into the types of advertising you see among other things. I even see it on my phone with the Google Now tab being filled with liberal news sources.
I was pretty legit at FPS when I was 12 years old. Had years of experience in Doom, Duke 3D, and various others (Half-Life 1 wasn't released until I was 13).

Bush had a horrible record with civilian casualties with OIF. Bush seemed like a cool guy to have a beer with and he was great during the aftermath of 9/11, but that doesn't change the fact that he was a pretty bad president regardless of your leanings. \n\nSadly, Obama was 100 times worse.
Iger has managed to drive the stock up by acquiring cash cow franchises and milking them for all they're worth. In the mean time, he's also kinda shit all over the company, its employees, and customers.

I don't see how believing that marriage is between only a man and a woman means hating gays. Even if Pence believes in some sort of conversion therapy, as long as said therapy methods are humane (not electric shock therapy or some craziness) then how would this translate into him hating gays? They've pretty much made "doesn't agree with" turn into "hates"
This lady is a disastah
You've been ignoring this entire papacy if you think that people are jumping at the pope without a moment's thought. This pope has done all he can to sow confusion and undermine Church teachings. It's not for us to call him a heretic or anti-pope even though we can certainly speculate as such based on his words and actions. We are bound to serve him as long as he is recognized as the legitimate pope, but that does not mean we should follow him into error.
George W Bush also gave us the great America's Army video game. \n\nObama gave us crappy America's Army 3 & Proving Grounds.
BTW, this is an average. Based on the historical index some of these guys left off with much worse than the numbers here. Nixon is an example of a decently well liked president whose numbers tanked after Watergate. \n\nGeorge W Bush actually hit 90% after 9/11 and ended in the 30s.

Not necessarily Satan, but still demons.\n\n"Therefore, my beloved, shun the worship of idols. . . . What do I imply then? That food offered to idols is anything, or that an idol is anything? No, I imply that what pagans sacrifice they offer to demons and not to God. I do not want you to be partners with demons." (1 Corinthians 10:14,19-20.)\n\nAlso, depending on your translation: "All the gods of the Gentiles are devils." (Psalm 96:5)\n\n"And served their idols, and it became a stumblingblock to them.\nAnd they sacrificed their sons, and their daughters to devils." (psalm 106:36-37)\n\n"They stirred him to jealousy with strange gods; with abominations they provoked him to anger. They sacrificed to demons that were no gods, to gods they had never known" (Deut 32:16-17).\n\n"For you provoked your Maker with sacrifices to demons and not to God; You forgot the eternal God who nourished you, and you grieved Jerusalem who nurtured you" (Baruch 4:7-8).
Maybe it'll be easier to just make a massive moat filled with alligators.
yep, he's a sellout. Then again, he's also following the standard set by the current pope and everything that the Church has stood for since Vatican II (a breach of almost 2000 years of Tradition).
Peer reviews should be done with a neutral mindset, but that's never done. My wife does research in a psychological setting and even there I've seen instances where she submitted a paper for peer review and it comes back with revisions because the reviewers didn't think the results lined up with their beliefs. It's nonsense.
> Losing a competitive battle is better than getting your ass kick from start to finish.\n\nThe game was only really competitive in the first quarter. NE was getting embarrassed in the 2nd quarter and wasn't looking that great until the end of the 3rd... Then Atlanta got embarrassed for the rest of the way.  21-3 2nd, 0-25 4th/OT. The Pats made the Falcons look like a bunch of chumps at the end of the game.
I wouldn't say 100 years, either way and we see how morality has followed into the crapper. All of the Protestant churches fell one by one into accepting the social norms of the time. As of 100 years ago, every Christian Church in the world rejected contraception, no fault divorce, cohabitation, and homosexual sex acts and unions. Now only the Catholics (in doctrine anyway) and the Orthodox (Orthodox allow for divorce) do.
Good, hopefully conservatives begin having bigger families and we can wipe out this plague within a generation or two.
Could also be "That's funny." Either way, "Ivanka" just seems to go with the picture.\n\nGeorge W coming in at the end and then backing out is another funny touch.
I lament at the greatness that was once Western Civilization which is now crumbling before our eyes.
Nope. The only things that are to be said from the Seat of Peter and meant to be infallible does one need to agree with. Nothing that this pope has said fits that description. If the Pope states any heresy as infallible there would be a true war within the Church as such a thing is said to be protected by the Holy Spirit. Instead, he works to seed confusion and change "pastoral practices" rather than actual Doctrine. That's why the issue over Communion for Divorced and Remarried is such a big deal right now.
People are slowly starting to realize that the revolt of the last 50-100 years (really this all began in the Enlightenment Age) has turned our society into a down spin. What's worse is that the elites orchestrated this from top to bottom in order to destabilize society in order to put the old order into chaos so they can swoop in and introduce their own new order. \n\nThis war is and has been for some time been on the family. Family is the building block and foundation for all of civilization. Religion, marriage, and chastity (chastity means celibacy outside of marriage and monogamous sex within marriage) are all hallmarks of family stability. These also feed into things like national and ethnic pride and a flourish culture. The revolution of recent times has gone and destroyed all of this. We now live in a world where evil is good and good is evil.\n\n“A time is coming when men will go mad, and when they see someone who is not mad, they will attack him, saying, 'You are mad; you are not like us.” ― St. Anthony the Great

All carried out by our wonderful intelligence agencies. I think they should be called "clock and dagger" agencies since whenever they give intelligence it's highly flawed.

It'd be kinda funny if Lib women eventually start becoming more modest in how they dress because of "men oppressing them."

I'd say that most blacks and non-hippie older people that are Democrats are moderates. They aren't involved in this kind of bs.
I would question your sanity. But then again this isn't new in /r/sociopath 
You still cry if you're a sociopath. Sociopaths just have shallow emotions and can't feel guilt or empathy. Everything else is fine, it just doesn't arise or last too long. Just felt like I needed to clarify on that, crying doesn't disprove his diagnosis. 
I somehow knew this was going to happen, I secretly wish it did. Now here it is, time for the edge to get 10000% more out of control
lol
+1 made me laugh. Dobble de dobble dah.
Then why did you rant about it if you barely even frequent this sub. One would think you'd see no difference. 
I live near a fucking police station, you think its easy getting in contact any sort of drugs, even petty ones? The place is littered with cops and that chaos stretches for miles. \n\n\n\n\nSo, yeah, under a rock sure. 
Same with my parents, my mother was kinder but she was a bit... Idk very controlling. My father was worse, but he had a better house so I thought of him as the lesser of two evils. I envy that you can still bring that out, I have yet to try and feel something similar to that. But, meh, we take what we can get amiright? XD 
Not really, those aren't repeated noises. I can't do anything against it other than telling the person to stop. I don't see what music has to do with mesophonia. 
So... You using Reddit, specifically this thread, is extreme for you and makes you feel powerful? \n\n... Yikes. You don't get out much do you? 
And clicking pens... Repeated noises etc. Fuck, pisses me off. 
I think this running joke might actually gain traction enough for the sociopath handshake to be an actual thing. \n\nWhat a time to be alive\n
You ask us why we're still posting here. The obvious answer is for entertainment and something to cure boredom. My question is, why are you still lurking and spying just to say "EY GUUIZ UR NOT REUL". Are you retarded? 
Light... Is that you? 
Same here, I personally have an affinity to cats. What about you? 
I'd rather die, it felt like I did anyways. I felt like a fucking bum just waiting for the hand of god to reach into my chest and rip out my organs bit by bit. It was the worst version of not caring in my entire life. \n\n10 out of 10  masochists would love. \n\n
Those salty liberal tears, best thing I've seen in years. \n\n(Oh, hey. That rhymed.)
Well said. 
Can confirm. Though I got bored the first couple of days, everyone else seems to be holding on but I wonder how long it'll take until everyone just doesn't bother posting. 
Majority of those with ASPD don't try to 'fix' themselves. Don't know what the hell you're smoking. 
Give this man some gold goddamn it. 
X'D That last sentence is good shit.\n\nAnyways, yeah I get you. I guess I've just plateaued, emotionally maybe, so I just do trivial shit since everything seems to stimulate me even less than before. What are the less masochistic ways you handle your boredom btw? I just... Rewatch shows and read articles, seems to just make my boredom worse. 
Whatever the herd believes reality is. Get with the program sheep! 
( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) 
You're lucky that gives you some sort of response, my parents were like that and looking back on it doesn't do anything for me. Shitty...
Basically just "muh gender wage gap" which has been already proven false to fucking death. The beaten horse doesn't need to get beaten again for this bs. 
Lol I got the same as well. Though, for me, a woman once told me she felt intimidated by me but also very intrigued. She said that my stare and just how I speak in general was what drew her in. \n\nHad no interest in her but it was fun to indulge her. 
We always have to try something once, no? 
Trial and error, avoiding the ones who speak about shit that has already been debunked. There's never one sole news source to get all your info, especially if you want to be as skeptical as possible. But I check in on select stuff from Info Wars and other news sources I don't really remember the names of. \n\n(Don't know why your comment got a downvote, here's a +1)
BBQ... XD
Name checks out. 
Honestly, if people asked at least 50 people that used to know me or know me now you'll get so many conflicting answers. Guess it's a good thing, people won't be able to 'spy' and 'figure you out' easily. Keeps people stumped. \n\nI always cringe when I have to refer to my facade as a mask, it just comes automatically to me. But the description of it can't be any better, it's accurate nevertheless. 
Remember to change your name to Carl
Are you retarded? 
I think Empathy is some weird sort of selfishness honestly. 
Fucking... THIS exactly this, someone finally said it. \n\nIt's funny though, I always thought that guilt would help them realize how shitty NTs are and that may prompt them to change. Funnily enough Socios are the ones who actually change and we don't even fucking feel guilt. \n\nThey constantly fail at convincing me how useful their thought/emotional processes are to them. It just seems like it holds them back and blinds them. 
The edge strong in this one.
Made me laugh bro. GG
Why do you think there's a fucking thread dedicated to sociopaths you cunt. I think the fact that this even exists is evidence enough.
This has been asked at least 3 times for the past few months and it's getting annoying. Use the search bar first guys, jesus. 
I was raised as a single child, I have a half brother that I never see though. But he's cool and I've taken a liking to him. 
Though, it's evident that we are not, in fact, all the same. If we were, we wouldn't have different religious beliefs, morals, personalities, and different skin colours. 
Nice b8 m8
I didn't mean to sound aggressive, my bad. \n\nBut I'm glad you're open minded about talking about it, it's usually something Liberals will shit their pants over. ThoughI disagree about the majority of the countries being that way, China and Japan for sure since they don't like letting those from outside the  country live there. \n\nBut places like the U.S and the current infestation of Muzzies in Europe and wreaking havoc will quickly make that change. ('that' being that races are the same or uniform.) Everyone seems to be pushing the 'diversity' stuff, and... Well look at Germany. 
Sleep, better alternative than being overworked or bored out of my mind all day long. 
Think it's smart to confess that? On... The internet? Where it's fairly easy to find who the person is and convict them. No? Yeah. No. 
Realized he believed in his own persona he's made for himself until he found this sub and realize he was one of us. 
Exactly. It's tiring to see people say "HAHA I just manipulated my therapist I'm fUCKING AWESOME" \n\nFucking retards jesus. 
Damn dude, you fake the accent or does it just fade off due to a foggy mind? 
I'm particularly lucky. I have some people that will do really selfless acts just to protect me or keep me in their lives, in some way or another. Funnily enough I still feel like people are out to get me, or eventually betray me. You can only trust yourself. 
Shit, wish my therapist is like that. She seems to keep on trying to prove to herself that I'm not a socio. She reaches all the time it's almost sad. She's also very brief on the socialising thing, its been a month and I feel like there's been zero progress. \n\n
Lol I do the same. The only annoying part is that you have to make sure that person isn't going to butt in to your new group, whether friends or just romantic relationships, because that just becomes a shitshow. 
Cringe. I almost feel bad for those types of people, you'd think as trained therapists they'd be better than that somehow. 
I presume that was sarcasm, but I get where you're  coming from anyways lol. 
**accidentally buys a sex slave**\n woops
Say you're in shock, and widen yours eyes just a smidge. \n\nEither that or cover your face and frown. No one cares if you don't cry, as long as you LOOK sad. Though sometimes that's annoying so the former is easiest. 
Smoker? Or just internet cancer? 
Ugh I totally get you. Or even when you say something simple or slightly depressing they're like "How did that make you feel?" or "Tell me more about that." fucking hell idk woman. 
Lol I've done the same. Some people just don't know when to back off
Nice b8 m8 ;) 
I never said I did? Think you're the one trying to make me edgy. I was just saying what was on my mind about the situation fucking hell. 
Lol, ikr. 
"I actually understand it" proves my point. There's an extent of how much you know about a certain subject, this is one of those subjects. 
How so? 
Now now, lets not make this about Obama. Everyone already knows he was a failure.
They're coming back with a new season, at least they're planning to. But they need to plan better since Mads Mikkelsen has been cast in other movies and shit. \n\nApparently not canceled, they'll be back but it'll take a while. 
What the... What? 
May I suggest 2 bottles of tranquilizers. Or... A couple dozen Prozac pills? 
Your 'feeling jack shit' sounds more like depression than sociopathy. Our emotions are there, they're just shallow. Don't know how many times we need to keep repeating that. 
INTJ. I've taken this test already. 
+1 last part had me burst out laughing. 
Amen, has happened to me many times. They get weird around you, and in some cases clingy. I run as soon as I start seeing those signs. But I usually stick around for a while and then leave, probably has something to do with my mild sadism, but who knows.
Lol sounds like my father. Honestly either you punch the daylights out of him to teach him a lesson if he's so fucking anal about stupid crap like that, or switch roomates/move. \n\nIt is so difficult for me to be able to control my homicidal tendencies towards people like that. 
This comment is pure gold. 
Maltese Falcon (I believe) 
Shit that's true. Though I'd either be easier to plead insanity or get more years in my sentence... not taking any chances. Not like I'd do anything illegal but you know how it is.
Hm... Maybe it's our lack of reactions to things, maybe our pure bluntness. I can't accurately guess since we all act differently in the real world. We do seem to have some sort of effect on people though, I just can't decide if that's good or bad. 
Was a long-ass time ago. Don't even remember it that well, I do remember doing it frequently but it never lasted long. Like a broken record.
Too bad, I liked ImAlexx.
In 'most' countries? You mean... The one free murder policy exists? 
I love you you speak about sociopaths as a collective. Like, if they don't do that one thing they aren't a sociopath, and if they do that one thing they definitely are. \n\nHow long is it going to take people to realize that you're just making yourself look like an idiot. 
No, just wanted to get an opinion without people downvoting my simple question to hell, or even downvoting those who agree with the above. \n\nGuess I was wrong, but at least the post didn't get flamed to death. I at least want to get ideas from both sides on a topic that has no leg to stand on other than political correctness/morals, in what I've seen so far. It's a very undisputed subject and very taboo. So I was interested. \n\nThough I don't have multiple accounts no, I find that pathetic. 'least have the gall to put your name to what you post. 
Implied being the key word. Don't jump to such retarded conclusions.

#NotAllCarls
A couple weeks back I actually thought about it seriously and I was like: "What... What if we just gathered a bunch of sociopaths irl or on Skype or some shit."\n\nI doubt I'd be an 'amazing' experience, but I'd be interesting. I wonder if everyone would put on that 'mask' around others like them. 
That got me thinking as well. I would always casually mention to my parents, when theu asked me why I didn't react or seem to not care about something I honestly told them that I didn't. But they'd always rebut with "Oh of course you do, you'll realize that when you're older. You just don't understand right now."\n\nLo and behold, I actually didn't care, looking back on it. It seems that people like telling you what you feel because they can't imagine someone not feeling anything. Or at least, not feeling like they do. 
Sometimes you hate something so much because you know too much about it. (What happened to me with Politics. Now I love it though so X'D) 
That is... Amazing. You are a true sociopath CONGRATS! 
Thought she was dead at first, I was mildly dissapointmented to see her move and run for the door. Dude should have aimed better. 
oh fuck you're talking about me 
I never based my opinion on a headline, especially not his. I'm talking from experience and already looking at plenty of evidence myself to KNOW what the hell I'm talking about when I say the gender wage gap is nothing real. If some woman is being paid less, then she should tell her boss or take it to court, it's illegal to be payed less than ANYONE who does the same job you do.

He'll be deporting more than a million or so illegals with criminal records. How much you want a bet the majority are Muslims AND that the crime rates will go down SPECTACULARLY. \n\nIf anything, he has a backbone until the rest of those asskissers. I'd rather have a loudmouth than a group of fakes frenching me in the pink. 
Especially since we're all lazy fucks. 
I've tried this before, it's very trippy but so worth it. Sometimes may not work though, mine once just gave me an in-dream shake, shrugged his shoulders then walked away. Curses... Even my dream characters are assholes. 
"I don't wanna"
Thats good to know. I'm just getting tired of everyone playing the fucking victim. *BooHoo* "I'm offended because you said something." Well get the fuck over it. Life isn't one big safe space and not everyone's opinions will align.
My wife was like that when we first got married. I took my recently purchased pistol out of the case and checked to make sure the chamber was cleared. In the process of me checking the chamber she began to cry and wouldn't come near it. After I explained a few things about guns and gun safety she calmed down but was still nervous. It wasn't until I took her to the range and let her fire a few rounds that she started to really understand the joy of owning firearms. She is now very thankful for our gun rights and encourages me to conceal carry when we are out.
Trust me, I completely understand. We went through the same stuff when people we knew started having kids and acting like they were better than us. It gets really tiring hearing "You don't understand because you don't have kids." You have good reason to be jaded.
I would like to say that this really concerns me. I already feel that I am paying into social security that I will never receive because it is so poorly managed/people are living longer. Now I have to worry about illegals stealing my identity and the IRS just fucking brushes it off like its no big deal. Fuck the IRS. They have been shitting on us for quite some time. Harassing republican based charities and such.
For real. I just ordered my wife a Tornado Red Sportwagen SE and was just thinking how I wish they sold these in the US.
I agree, mkIV's were really nice. Part of me wishes I never got rid of it but then I remember why I did. I factory ordered a 2011 Mustang GT and that will forever be my favorite car with the R in a very, very close second.
I was just recently reading up on Rastafari (which is pretty interesting)  but came upon this in the process. There are multiple references in the Bible about locks. One even mention seven locks which can only be dreads.\n\nhttps://www.openbible.info/topics/dreadlocks
What town would that be? I am on the east coast and curious where I would live in Germany haha.
I find the best sleep comes after an intense argument with the wife followed by the intense makeup sex. 
Haha, hard to tell these days. I figured you were but took the low road instead. Now I'm sad.
I would drive the newer ones, especially the RLine ones. I think they did a good job on the styling of the new ones and made them a little more masculine. At least it doesn't come with a flower holder now...
I never heard anything about it. I was just using him as an example. The fact of the matter is they have a clear agenda by the way they choose who they go after. "Oh, you're one of us? Carry on... Oh, you're not one of us? You fucking Sexist Nazi Islamophobe REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!" 
Isn't she supposed to leave the country or something? I remember her and a whole swarm of others saying they would if Trump won. Just another lying leftie i guess.
Thank you for the correction!
Nice insight. Thank you!
Doesn't really sound like the same system to me. If we didn't have the electoral college then California and New York would determine pretty much every election seeing as how they are the most population dense and tend to vote liberally on a pretty substantial basis. The point of the electoral college is to ensure that the people who live in less populated states still have a voice. Which was the case in this past election.
Yeah but... but... muh culture\n\nSpez: REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
I watched the majority of the video and I believe he wore the hat to troll people. He also said don't vote trump at one point.
*#endAcornViolence is now trending*
Fuck Meryl. I can't stand uppity bitches like her. Always looking down her nose at others. I hope she dies in a house fire (not really, just expressing my discontent).
Is coming out and saying the case was reopened against the law (I honestly don't know)? I don't care for protocol if it means getting the truth out. Maybe he was doing the country a solid because he saw how corrupt she is and couldn't watch her weasel her way into the Presidency.
Can't. Turtle dead.
I never said they should, it should be equal amongst all persons.
No worries, I completely understand. Trust me, I get it. I try to avoid giving out too much identifying information as well.
Proof or it didn't happen!
HAHAHAHA Lame Cocks!!!
Any more photos? I would love to see an album of this!
Shut up, Meg!
It was. Sadly I had to get rid of it after I got out the military so I could afford to go to school. Downgraded to a GTI and now a '96 Jeep Cherokee :(
Confirmed. Do hate him/her.
Is your dad a commie? Only commies loathe football.
Even if he thinks he doesn't have a shot he should still fight for his daughter. That's his daughter and if he thinks he can raise her better then he should at least try, no matter how little of a chance there might be.
SHOTS FIRED
Why is that?
I completely agree. I really really wanted to vote for Gary Johnson but I couldn't stand seeing that corrupt cunt become President so I voted Trump. It was clear early on that she did not care one bit about anything other than becoming President. A lot of her viewpoints during the election were a complete 180 compared to 10 years ago. Obvious pandering. Couple that with the obvious collusion with the media and I couldn't take it. To this day the media jumps at any opportunity to make him look bad (granted he doesn't help himself much either) to the point that the media has been trolled a few times over.
I would argue that it is even more useful now.\n\nhttp://www.citylab.com/housing/2012/03/us-urban-population-what-does-urban-really-mean/1589/\n\nWould you agree that urban areas tend to vote primarily democratic? In my experience, they sure as hell do. According to the article above, in 2010 80.7% of the US population lives in urban areas. That means the rural folk in America would never have their voice heard or their vote count. How is that fair?
I mean, wasn't this the premise of him running for office? To drain the swamp? He had a lot help from you folks on here looking through the wikileaks emails and things like that. That seems to have calmed down a little bit and maybe its time to ramp back up now that there has been time to relax a little.
> To me it reflects an awareness of our shared destiny for which I am grateful.\n\nAre you speaking of globalism?
Thank you for your clarification. I appreciate the response instead of being attacked like others have done.
Care to explain how the system is fucked? I am curious.
Precisely this. The only reason she was the one running for presidency is because she cheated. Sanders should have been the democratic nominee. Yet all these people bend the knee to Hillary as if she is a fucking saint. She is a soulless harpy who would stop at nothing to become President. 
Do ants hearts beat fast?
Is it active sabotage to reopen a case when new evidence is provided against her? The women is corrupt as hell and the evidence against her is abundant, yet people worship her. I just don't get it.

I can understand that. I greatly admire those who adopt. Providing for those who were forgotten is very commendable!
I would hate not being able to have firearms in my home. I am definitely thankful to live in America.
I think the way it is now is not efficient nor representative of the people. I asked the question to spur debate and see other peoples opinions. I think the two party system is flawed and should be removed. I think there should be a sort of playoff for presidency with multiple rounds of voting. I am not a political scientist so I can't even begin to explain how that would work but it would at least give a fair shot to more individuals instead of the choice between A or B.

WTF? Where did it go? I saw it earlier and now it's deleted.
> It was partially designed this way by the framers, so that the interests of city-dwellers wouldn't always override those of rural farmers.\n\nThis was always my interpretation of why it existed and why I like it. If it was based off of popular vote then rural voters wouldn't really matter. 
Vitiligo?
you dropped this->  /s\n\nspez: Please read below... I am dumb. 
I got out a few years ago. I misread the comment as "she's such an **attractive** woman" and was blown away. 
I used to get the flu shot every year because the military required it. Every year I got the flu. When I got out I quit getting the flu shot, and wouldn't you know it, I quit getting the flu. I say if you are a healthy adult then there is no need to get one. Children and elderly I think should.
Keep it up sir! You look like you enjoy what you are doing and as long as you do that, you can't go wrong. Keep on keeping on!

Yes, they should. However, if the news doesn't pick up on it then it doesn't spread and gain popularity. The modern day and social media really is a fickle bitch.
Fuck it, I don't give a damn about Karma. Downvote away my friends!
Bribery and constant pressure will do that to you.
One of the things that bothers me most is how they seem to choose at random who they want to single out. There are many comedians out there that joke about rape or make antisemitic jokes but no one makes a fucking peep about that. Why aren't people talking about Daniel Tosh being a racist or sexist or antisemite. Not trying to single Tosh out but just using him as a singular example.
Are you surprised? It IS a Phillies fan.
the "/s" is to display that you were being sarcastic. You can't possibly think that cow is attractive, right?\n\nSpez: WOW! I just reread your first comment... Disregard everything I have said. It's too early I guess.
It was meant as a joke. Didn't intend to trigger any snowflakes. Sorry.
I would hate to see Hillary voter stupid then...
So you believe she is the only corrupt person in our government? You believe people aren't controlled by those who donate to them? The thing is, there is clear evidence against Hillary. You can look for yourself and see. So why aren't charges being brought up against her? Maybe because the corruption runs deep and those that are in control of filing charges against her would have benefited more by not doing so. People will do anything to obtain a greater position of power, just look at Hillary.
Getting really tired of hearing that. It has happened before. That is the point of the electoral college, to ensure that just a few populace states don't determine who the President is. Would you approve of a voter ID law? 
The fact that 10 year olds are even allowed to sit around and watch Youtube videos all day bothers me. Go outside and play you little shits. It saddens me that I live in a neighborhood with lots of elementary age kids and very rarely see them out playing. My mom used to have to come get me when I was that age because I never wanted to go inside. Technology is ruining our youth and I say that as a millenial (technically).
She can't even make it into the back of a van without 3 people throwing her into it.
Keep up the good work!
Wow! You are delusional. Comparing Benghazi to 9/11? What fucked up little world do you live in. One was a act of terrorism who Al Qaeda admitted to, the other was an act of negligence by the Secretary of State. Do you even look into things on your own or just listen to what the clowns on the television tell you. Keep living in your echo chamber. Your analysis of my statement baffles me. 
I never said that.
Kids? One maybe because he was 16. Not the others at ages 18 and 23. You know better at any of those ages than to beat a man after telling you to stop torturing a turtle.
I haven't looked too far into the whole Flynn situation so let it be known that I don't know the details. However, if he was indeed in contact with Russia then it should be investigated. The same way Hillary should be investigated. It would be hypocritical not too. No matter where the leaks came from, the fact that he may have been doing something illegal remains. In my opinion both sides deserve looking into, Flynn and whoever released the leaks. Don't be like the left and only focus on who released it and not the content. Again I am unaware of all the details so I could just be talking out of my ass. If so, feel free to correct me.
Dealers choice...
Really makes me miss my mkIV R32. One of the most amazing sounding exhausts of any car ever. I used to get so many people coming up to me just to compliment the exhaust. Exhaust was pretty much stock minus flapper mod and resonator delete. \n\nDeep Blue Pearl is the best color btw!
That's exactly what it was. Pretty much a very extensive list of all the bad things/collusion Soros is involved with. It was very impressive.
You should do that remind me thingy for 28 years.
Wasn't trying to imply that us or anyone else is immature because they don't have children. I was only making the point that we weren't ready for the extra responsibility of having children when we were in our 20's. If anything, that makes you more mature for knowing what responsibilities you can handle at a given point in your life.
Very nice. I wish we had those available to us in the states. For that matter, I wish we had a lot of the cars in Europe available to us in the states.
I would agree that the system isn't perfect. By definition I would consider myself libertarian and would have voted for Johnson if it weren't for Hillary. I don't like the way it works now where you are pretty much stuck choosing A or B. I think there should be a sort of playoff for the presidency. I have jokingly said this before but have come to believe it could work if smarter minds looked into it. 
I just read that a car loses about 12% of its fuel efficiency in winter weather. 19 mpg is a little more than 12%.
So what you are saying is that rural farmers don't really matter because that's what senators are for? Maybe I am not following your train of thought.
Don't knock it til you try it! Start an argument about nothing and then fuck like rabbits. It is a great way to relieve pent up stress.
I have to agree. Used to be the top comment was full of insightful comments or things that related to the post. Just garbage now.
That picture looks like it was taken in 1985 haha.
When I said look into things yourself I was referencing Clinton as a whole, not just Benghazi. As far as time spent investigating, there wasn't much to investigate with 9/11. They pretty much raised their fucking hand and said "yep, it was us". Pretty piss poor analogy to compare 9/11 to Benghazi.
what about squirrels?
Both of those are just wonderful. I love the color of the .:R
I... I'm not sure how to respond to that.
I'm not privy to all details as I don't work for the FBI. From my recollection, there was plenty of evidence in the Podesta emails to bring charges forth or at least prove her unfit for presidency due to collusion with the media for one. There was also evidence of her taking instructions from those she received donations from on how to handle foreign matters while she was secretary of state. I think a lot of people disagree with you on the politician thing. That is one reason he got elected, people were tired of the same old crooked politicians never getting anything done and failing to act on their promises. I understand why people don't like Trump, but you can't say he isn't doing what he promised.
it's a gentle reminder of how quickly i can end your life.
Porto isn't a team constantly talked about, but they're certainly good.

TV shows have *parental guidelines* in the US, which i am assuming you are from.  movies follow the same reasoning, to better understand what kind of audience would find the film appropriate.  video games are, again, *parental guidelines.*  to my knowledge, there isn't an established guideline for books.\n\na lot of this is entirely for the sake of protecting kids from being subjected to materials not suitable for them.  you can use these same content warnings to avoid stuff that may bother you, that's entirely your role as a consumer.
Been involved in esports for more than half of my life.  Would love to be able to give developing players a chance at competing where factors limit them and give them a chance at going full-time.
oh no!!!
sounds like CL Juve :(
I think that's a reasonable approach.  I only support Fnatic as an org because of cArn and how influential he was in how I saw esports as a spectator/player and as a prospective career.

i think that a community that feels that strongly enough about trigger warnings should decide whether or not to implement that mutual understanding between users to better their experiences.  i also think it serves to create a "safe space," even if you aren't exactly for them.  i'm fine if a private community wants to conduct itself in this way.\n\ni just don't see the likelihood of this catching on into the mainstream and find it self-defeating.

My eventual brother-in-law is headed back to Rotterdam towards the end of the season, hopefully to celebrate Feyenoord's title with his father.  I've got no real attachment, but he's one of the biggest supporters out there and his enthusiasm is contagious.  Seems like a wild ride to follow them.
they've been very big in europe for a while, especially in the football scene.
your story is unfortunate, but i don't know what kind of environment you're putting yourself into where you just stumble upon rape stories?  i don't think i've heard anybody tell a story about that without prefacing it, but ymmv. \n\n>I'm better now, but others aren't\n\nthat's great that you're doing better and i hope others get better too\n\n>so much of this sort of abuse is unreported and not admitted that it's absurd to think you can predict who's been hurt.\n\n"this sort of abuse" is rape, right?  yeah, i agree.  that's why i never predicted who's been hurt.  i don't understand what this even adds to your statement.\n\n>So before you claim we don't need trigger warnings, talk to the people that might actually need them.\n\ntrigger warnings are fine in a niche community where involved parties can all agree on doing so for the greater good.  i am not for policing the language of the public though.

if you tried to tell any of the people i know unfortunate enough to have seen combat or been a victim of that sort of abuse, they'd be insulted that you feel they're so defenseless that they need to be coddled/sheltered by you.\n\nof course, this is my own experience and yours may vary.  i don't see trigger warnings being requested outside of niche communities, which is understandable.  those communities can set that sort of expectation.  but in public (which Facebook is pretty much public) you are not going to be handled with that kind of care.

It really depends on the color way. My gel lyte 3s are a rather "loud" cw so what i find looks best is if i just keep the rest of my outfit simple and have the shoes be the focus. And by that i mean just very basic skinny jeans, a plain white or black hanes t shirt and maybe a baseball cap.

It depends on what aesthetic im going for. If i want an old school punk rock skater look then ill wear my old skools with some high white socks and a shirt from a punk band i love like bad brains, bad religion or black flag. Anything else though I just wear regular old ankle socks unless im gonna roll my jeans up which in that case ill wear my vans and high white socks because idk i like the way that cropped or rolled up jeans look with long white socks.

When people complain about this sub having too many teenagers on it, I always disagreed with them, because I never understood why that was supposed to be a bad thing, right up until I read this comment.

People have called me out for wearing metallica shirts and its especially annoying to me because metallica has been my favorite band literally since i could form opinions on music, IE age 4.
Ok i would understand if you were wearing like rick or raf but that? What the fuck is wrong with that dude. If i a person wearing that i would just be like "oh he dresses nice i doubt its into streetwear like i am". I wear outfits like that when i wanna look nice but dont wanna get judged
You know i knew I hated r/gaming but right after I saw this post I was like why the fuck have i not unsubbed from r/gaming
Thanks. I normally wouldn't wear a long shirt like that but I think it looks great with that sweater specifically because the sweater is even longer than the shirt. As far as the barneys, most of it is more dressy stuff but they had some off white in there plus all the cdg converse.

I didnt even buy anything, my brother bought a supreme hat but that was it. Its cool to go look at the stores but its honestly not all that great for shopping. I dont get why people talk about it like its some great place to shop, honestly id rather rummage through a westfield mall for decent stuff than go to fair fax

Yeah i guess it all comes down to opinion. Its cool for you because you can afford things like Y-3 and common projects but id rather go to 3rd street promenade because i just like the stores more and its more in my price range. I only went in the barneys because i knew they had CDG converse, otherwise i would just be looking. The barneys there has offwhite and common projects btw. It was a lot of dressy stuff but there was a lot of street wear stuff in there too
Yeah that's not really cost efficient when you have a country with a prison population the size of most small countries and private owned prisons where the owners couldn't possibly give any less of a shit about what actually happens in there

Do you think this will be the final nail in the coffin for the establishment propaganda machine?

My point was more that the law and what is constitutional is mostly arbitrary.
Drew Brees
Never getting married in the first place. Even if I did I see marriage as a contract that doesnt require the government. 
As someone who stayed stoned all the time, this is false. And I smoked so much I would wake up in the middle of the night to smoke. For starters there is the smell.
Speed and tackling on defense are the key. Eapecially from the linebackers. WhatbI want the Saints to do is to stop proritizing size and character over talent. We pass on Marcus Peters because of character concerns.and now he is a pro bowl CB and we are starting bums. We draft Stanley Jean-Baptiste because he has elite size for a CB in the second round and release him after 1 year. Payton even said he would have taken him in the first round. Every year there are quality defensive players that fall for character concerns. We arent drafting a choir. 
Otis Nixon looking a little funny in this picture.
so he wants Trump to be removed for winning because Russia supposedly helped him win and Hillart given the presidency. Does he have no sense of irony.
Could he do it without Big Show holding his hand?

We cant call ourselves the land of the free or a free country when we lead the world in incarceration rate. Few things should be punishable by imprisonment unless there is a victim or intended victim. I almost have an aneurysm when someone says drugs ruined a persons life when it was the arrest, incarceration and arrest record that ruined their life. Once we win the war on drugs we need to go after and prosecute those who have been lying and deceiving to keep the war going. Most of the negative effects drugs have on society are actually a result of prohibition. A lucrative black market with high demand products always leads to violence. Remember that "those who fail to learn from history are bound to repeat it" quote you hear in school. We learned prohibition didnt work with alcohol prohibition in the 20's yet we keep doubling down on that policy. We need to charge those who have lied and deceived with crimes against peace like the Nazi's. The crimes arent limited to the US. We have been waging the war in other countries and heavily influencing their countries policies to support prohibition in their countries. Over 100k Mexicans have died because of drug cartels that wouldnt exist without prohibition. Thats just one country.
I get good starting hands 9 out of 10 games regadless of who I play. Maybe don't use 30 card decks with single copies of good cards.
wish there was more information on the class. It says only attendance is required but does that mean I could smoke a blunt beforehand? Are we going to be required to agree with what they teach in the class? I know we can fake it but I am too much of a smartass.

I would sell my soul to get one of the Paul family members elected President. Good to see he gets some love here. Please vote for him when you get the chance.
Yes I do.
New stadium. Lots of good prospects nearing the majors. MVP caliber 1B in his prime. 
wait a second, going after the qb and being physical is a valid NFL strategy?  That cost us two high draft picks and got our coach suspended. \n\n\n\nand before anyone says it was encouraging illegal hits, the players were fines for drawing a flag. 
pass rusher. We will probably draft one, but he will be shit like the last 10 we drafted.
You named 4 guys and none of them were Chipper Jones. 
As as white person, if there are any womem out there who want to fuck a white person I am here for you.
How about they get the sand out of their vagina instead. I guarantee you your kids here and use that kind of language. When you try to shield them from it they think its cool so curse when talking to friends. Source, I was that age a fuck or fucking was every other word used when the grown ups were not around. Highly doubt thats changed in the last 20 years.
I would sell 50. Ignorance really is bliss. I wish I was dumb enough to believe in a magic man in the sky.
There is nothing wrong with doing cocaine. People are going to die. People die driving to work. People slip and die in the shower. Dont buy into the fearmongering. Alcohol is one of the most dangerous drugs out there and no one is willing to ban it to save tens of thousands of lives a year because banning it will only make the problem worse as we discovered in the 1930's. Dont use this as an excuse to ruin the lives of millions of other people. Arresting people for using drugs rarely helps them. The main negative side effect is cops and prison. Drugs can ruin lives but the prohibition of drugs ruins 10 times as man lives. 
If this isnt unconstitutional then what good is the constitution. It can be interpreted to mean whatever they want it to mean. 
can confirm. Saints build defense like they are building a church choir. Not working out so well.
Taking kids from their natural parents is almost always bad for the kid. Even if the parent is a shitstain. What they have done to these kids is child abuse and whoever is responsible for taking the kids should be held criminally accountable. Not going to hold my breath on that, maybe they will get some of our tax money but it cant undo the damage. Her kids are probably being beaten or sexually assaulted as I type this. 
That is fucking brilliant. 
We aren't in perpetual war now? 
You would think Mexico would be embarassed that so many of their people try to escape. Instead of trying to fix the problems they whine about other countries not wanting them. Funny thing is when an accused killer escapes back to Mexico they refuse to hand them over.
Yes, AFC dynasty.
Amazing fact time. Bobby Cox won the division as manager of the Blue Jays before rejoining the Braves. So he won 16 straight division titles as a manager.
You know what facists do, they mass incarcerate. Wish you were still being tortured in Vietnam John.
Of course ESPN is the source. I dont care how big of shit AROD takes in the morning ESPN! Let it die.
Atleast they didnt beat up the person filming. Small victories. Sadly charges against this dude will stick because he ignored the cop. They will probably charge him with felony for "running from the cops" and resisting arrest. I think in Texas its automatic resisting arrest charges if they deploy their taser. He will probably plea bargain to get a few months instead of risking 15 years. It will haunt him for the rest of his life as it will be harder to get a job or go to school. If he has any mental illness it will probably be made much worse from his time in jail.\n\n\n\nAs much of a shitstain these cops are their violence will be justified as following policy. 
The homeowner must have used a terrible lawyer. If the robbers could access the computer to find it they could have put it there too. How hard can it be to impeach the credibility of thieves?

Anyone else remember that time cartoon network stopped playing Speedy Gonzalez because they said it was a racist stereotype and a shit load of Hispanics complained that they stopped showing their favorite cartoon.
Drew Brees for JJ Watt and the Texans 2018 rd 1/3 draft picks. Texans are serious Superb Owl contenders with Brees losing nothing they had from 2016 and dont even lose any picks this year. This is a strategic gamble for the Saints to be in position to draft a QB in the 2018 draft. Even if we have to trade up we have the extra first and third round pick. We would then have a DLine with Jordan, Watt, and Rankins. \n\n\nI love Drew as much as the next guy but he deserves more rings. Knowing fate we would probably end up in the Superb Owl against the Texans with Drew. I believe in Payton polishing a turd QB into something decent more than I believe Payton can polish a turd defense into something decent. 
Well I guess my opinion is biased but I dont see any way he could reach Chipper either. Chipper hasts a lot of value beyond just his stats in my opinion. I give players a lot of credit for being one team guys. Chipper was also one of the better leaders and clubhouse guys. Chipper could still be playing if he was willing to go to an AL team to play DH.
I had no problem with Galette. The team fucked up by giving him a big contract then releasing him. Inappreciate that he wanted to stay here enough to re-sign. \n\n\n\nI just assume most players are assholes. I dont even care if they beat their wives or girlfriends. If they dont like it leave. There are plenty of men out there working for 10 bucks an hour who dont beat their wife. I will take a couple beatings a year to be rich as fuck. 
nothing boosts my self esteem like someone saying I helped prevent a Hillary presidency. Nearly gives me an erection.
I would have voted for Bernie just for legalization despite his cuckoo for coco puffs economic plans. How can I be expected to vote for candidate that wants to put me in prison.
they got a war on poor people/drugs to fight. Slavery comes first.
Hovercars!
It depends on if the policy was in place when they signed. The facial hair policy is arbitrary and no effect on the players ability to perform. Teams cant just make any rule they want. They cant force every player to get mohawks. MLB is a legal monopoly, players cant quit and go work for another league. I guess they could go to Korean or Japanese leagues but they wont dare upset MLB by signing a player under mlb contract like that.
The MLBPA would probably file a grievance on the players behalf and most likely win. If the team really has a problem with it they can trade or release the player. 
wow, so when Revis does it its multiple felony charges but a cop who beats people up for filming them never gets charged. 
while I agree taxation is theft I am under no illusion we would ever eliminate them. At this point its just a punchline. 
oh no, they might have to give them some tax payer money. God forbid we hold a government official criminally responsible.

How can you have a conversation about the top 5 best 3B of all time and not mention Chipper Jones. It wouldnt bother me if you didnt name 4 out of 5.
i would much rather we stop mass incarcerating people instead of just applying the law to illegal immigrants. Maybe we can mass arrest illegal immigrants and use them as slave labor to build the wall. Non US citizens dont have our rights.
I will take any reason to go to Colorado.
She lools more like Debbie Wasserman-Schultz than Hillary.
Ok, lets deport the illegal immigrants to Canada instead of back to Mexico. Canada gets more diversity and the immigrants get to stay out of Mexico. Win win for everyone.
that was my reaction for about half the match.
Why would it? 
House Redwyne of the Arbor. A nice big island far away from the game of thrones with the best wine and a strong navy to defend itself. I would stay on that island and never leave. Whitewalkers invading Westeros? Not my problem, if they could swim the wall would be pointless. Perfect plan so long as no one gets their dragon turned into a wight.
When they zoom in on the guys face.
Like we havent all done stupid shit in our early 20's without the use of illegal drugs. Its far more likely the accident was caused by the alcohol than the cocaine. I dont want people using this as justification for mass incarcerating people and waging a war against poor people. A few deaths is not a reason to ruin the lives of millions of people. Freedom is not just the ability to make government approved good decisions. 
i am the kind of smartass that would hang myself to spite her and the court.
This is about most disliked, not worst qb. Being third best Saints QB is not saying much. I liked him at first with the playoff win and all but he had a bad habit of screwing up in the clutch. He would look great driving down the field on what could be a game winning drive then fumble the ball on the 10 yard line to lose the game. He broke our heart so many damn times. There was one season where we were 8-4 with 4 of the worst teams in the NFL coming up on our schedule. All we needed was 1 win to get a playoff spot. We lost all 4. There was the year he got injured and Delhomme, who was a fan favorite because he went to a local college, came in and won 4 straight games. Brooks was still given the starting job and proceded to shit the bed. He also made some of the dumbest mistakes like throwing the ball backwards or losing the ball when he pumps to throw.
I will agree on Kikaha but he was never a long term solution because he cant keep his knees from blowing up.
Shit like this just makese lose all hope for humanity. Even if he technicallly broke the law no responsible person would prosecute. It takes a truly evil and uncaring person to prosecute this kind of case. I personally would feEl a lot safer if the people who decided to prosecute were locked up. They are the danger to society.

When did she claim she didnt want to be elected because she is a woman? Its usually the first thing she says when someone asks her why she should be President.

I understand if Rand wants to pick his battles but Sessions is the last person who should be AG.\n\n\n\nDeep down I am holding out hope Rand is just playing the game his father wouldnt so the media and RNC will not blacklist him from running for president.

My sister did a very similar thing only the money she'd stolen was from my mother. My mom is a little absent minded so she thought nothing of the money. Over a span of six months my little sister stole more than $700. The way sister spent that money is a real son of a bitch. A little back story my sis couldn't hack it at private school so she was placed in public school where she met a pretty rough crowd. She was 11 and had a 13 year old S.O. They'd purchased a gun with the stolen money and planned on killing their teachers then make their way to my school and kill me.\n\nAnother student was shown the gun early morning and told his teacher. Both were arrested and confessed to their plot. I've never forgiven her.

Hello professor,\n\nI understand the grave concern, but what if we are already in a simulation? I feel that our existence may only be an observation of the time when the technology for the simulation was created. What if the quantum computers such as the D-Wave and subsiquent machines there after became entangled with all of the mass information which has been gathered over the last half century? As science fiction my idea is, wouldn't that be a logical groundwork for an advanced ai to have meaning for its existence? A digital god?

We meaning America owe the Chinese a shit ton of money. The actual number which has only been mentioned a few times is upwards of 12trillion dollars. The Chinese have been saber rattling like nobodies business, but it isn't televised here. Last year they launched a missle into space and shot down one of our star wars defense satellites. In this year so far they've developed supersonic small nuclear warheads, and have placed them along the borders of North Korea, China, Russia, and the edge of Eastern Europe. Just this last week the Doomsday clock was moved to 3 minutes till midnight from 5. The TPP was passed in order to hand over as much of America as the Chinese can buy just to help ease the pain. In New York the Chinese are buying large portions of Brooklyn and are putting up high rises using Chinese contractors with no one putting up a fight and no red tape. Land there is being sold in a day and a building is being put up in about a week 24 hour building. America fucked up big. We were all lead to believe that the war in Iraq was to stop alqueda and get Iraqs oil, but really China's GDP in 2001 was 1.4 trillion a year and growing meaning communism was winning. We had to stop that growth so, we got China to fund our war, almost all of it out of their pockets. Hundreds of millions are starving there now and their stock market has crashed. Russia and China are ready to blow this world back into nothing. This years election may end with a Manchurian candidate.
She was a minor when she made this offense and the punishment was juvenile hall with an all girls half way home before she was released back into society. The disciplinary action did nothing to better her behavior. At the ripe old age of 14 she started using drugs, her choice was meth. By 16 she'd stolen hundreds from my grandparents, other family members, and myself. She finally was arrested for forging checks. She was a real mess, meth rotted out all of her teeth and my grandparents paid for her orthodontic surgery. To redo her entire mouth was about 15k. She has cost my family so much money and caused such strife amongst our families. \n\nWe used to be very close with our extended family, but my sister's behavior made it so that we no longer got invited to gatherings. Her life choices she made when she was young and didn't know any better subsequently ruined our family ties.\n\nNow she lives with my father and works as a hospice nurse. Being around the terminally I'll and tending to the feeble has definitely humbled her. I don't have a close relationship with her, and I don't think I ever will

A friend who is also a high ranking Naval Officer and I were hanging out on a fall night in 2010 and I began talking about mass surveillance. I was mentioning a whistle blower named Bradley Manning who was in the news at the time and how I had read Iphones across the world were being tapped. He got upset and said it was impossible to collect that amount of data let alone process it into anything useful. I actually visited him when he was stationed at our US base in England. I of course remember that conversation, and I remember his answers seeming very disingenuous. I said he knew something, and that was our last conversation. Less than 3 years later did my so called conspiracy theory end up being exposed PRISM, Dropoutjeep, FiveEYES as fact through cables released by Edward Snowden. I wish I could just believe that Jesus was the son of god, Iraq had WMD's, and bailing out the banks instead of letting the markets crash are all legitimate and shouldn't be questioned.

Yes, some people are sensitive to polarized lenses. It is the way your brain is receiving the light information. Polarized lenses allow light waves traveling in a specific angle to be received by your eye. I have worked in optics for a very long time and this happens from time to time. Since you you've tried more then one brand of eyewear you're more then likely sensitive to polarized lenses. 
The simple way to see it is. If you won the lottery and wished to spend your winnings on 'potentially' generating a seamingly endless amount of money; It's your right.
You could paint them, but the paint will eventually chip. You need to use an airbrush and oil based paint because the frame is acetate. Also, the frame needs to be sanded in order for the paint to adhere. Finally the varnish would have to be a spay on poly resin or urethane coat. I have worked in the eye wear industry for ever and have seen everything. 
[Japan did it first!](http://fusion.net/story/5371/japanese-cholos-from-east-l-a-to-east-asia/)
Polarized lenses have a film sandwiched between 2 halves of lenses. At any given time light waves on an X and Y axis are being received by your eye. The film blocks the waves on X axis which causes glare. It is not a coating.

What you have there are 12KGF RayBan Aviators from the 1960's those have Bakelite Nose Pads. You can tell by the patina of the nose pads. In my professional opinion you should take that frame to an optician and have the lenses taken out, then go to a jeweler and have the frame sonic cleaned, or maybe the optician can do both. I would estimate the pair you have are worth $500 in that condition. There should be a stamp somewhere on the frame that reads 12KGF which means 12 Carat Gold Filled.

Mr.Tyson you and shared a jet ride from L.A. to N.Y. and we spoke about Nikola Tesla. I was wondering what are your thoughts about the recent findings that neutrinos are able to change/exist in three different phases?
I think the crossover took place when one black hole swallowed another black hole a few months ago. As I see it each black hole is a tear in an individual timeline. When both began their dance into merging, both made gravitational waves which vibrated at different intervals until pendulum waves are formed. The first gravitational waves may have been rouge or even cancelled each other out, but the gravitational waves once becoming synchronized caused timelines to cross seamlessly. Imagine two pendulums in a room being started moments after each other then being pushed towards each other eventually both sync up due to pendulum waves, but with black holes not only were gravitational and pendulum waves made, but I think also a spiral wave was made as one black hole with our former timeline was swallowed.

Windscreens all have a UV protective coating on them. It's not polarized though, but if you were wearing polarized sunglasses you would not see that butterfly glare, but instead see the driver. Also, those eyeglass lens that change from clear to tinted in sunlight known as Transition lenses do not work well or at all when sitting behind the windscreen. The UV coating keeps the driver and passenger from burning there retinas.

Amber lens or "shooter" yellow colored lenses made of mineral glass will give you the highest visible light transmission. Maui Jim, or Kaenon make sports lines of sunglasses with these types of lenses.
Don't stick your dick in crazy.
So yes they are more see through because you can only view one set of light waves. Polarized lenses let you see through glare, but L.E.D. screens and some mobile devices send out light waves that can be canceled out by polarized lenses. This makes it difficult or even impossible to see your screen. Try this experiment, put on your polarized sunglasses and look at your computer screen, then tilt your head to the left or right. You will see your screen go black.

Let this be known, I am an atheist, and I appreciate everyone's existence. It's not a challenge and I'm not doing this for karma. Maybe this might ignite the change our world needs to see. I will make this happen.

The wearer of polarized sunglasses is able to see through objects like water or glass that has a lot of light reflecting off its surface. So, a person wearing polarized sunglasses looking into a lake at noon will be able to see a fish swimming by, while a person wearing regular sunglass lenses will see only shimmering light reflecting off of the water.
Yep...that definitely sounds like a G.W. plan. In just the passed couple of days Americans are finding out about warrant less wiretapping which Bush's cabinet implemented. Everyones phone calls are being recorded. Silly America.

I believe those are made by Dillion eyewear. I am not sure which model they are.\n

Sad how it seems that being gay fully encapsulates one's identity. You're nothing but a normal fucking person who happens to love the cock/pussy. \n\nAnd this need to belong to an in-group of those like you whilst casting out outsiders is no longer needed. LGBTQ are widely accepted now in modern society. Yet it remains.\n\nShit, I'd love to have some lesbo friends where that sexual dynamic is completely off the table and with it the female pov on the world and everything. Different from that perspective but gay dudes too, they have their own unique insights as well of course but in both cases, if they're completely cucked by their conforming beliefs and identities on who and what they supposedly are, well... \n\nMy heart goes out to you and those in a similar situation whether gay or another minority and the difficulties faced in peer groups. Can only imagine just how hard that must be. Stay strong friend for who you are goes far beyond being just gay. But you already know that.
I don't think we are at all. Theilen's improvement year after years shows he's an extremely safe bet imo. Prior to this season the guy just always made plays and took advantage of the little playing time he got. Said prior to the season he was our #2WR based on how reliable he's proven himself to be when he played. Think he's hit or very near his peek, though.\n\nBut I agree, if we can't extend him at good value now he's going to get a bigger pay bump in '18 so we really do have to consider a 2nd for him. Especially with the big contracts we're going to need to pay to other guys soon. A #2 WR drops down on the most valuable list.
The plan would clearly be Asiata as our 3rd RB. For his price and experience can't ask for much better.\n\nWe're after a #1 RB, or at least one who can immediately split carries and possibly beat out Jet . One of our first three picks seems the obvious solution.\n\nDoubt we'd go FA unless it's for a cheap solid vet to be the starter on a one year contract. If we do it'd likely mark the end for Asiata because I'd assume then we take an RB later in the draft. A vet, Jet, and Asiata isn't an ideal trio for the future. I'll be very disappointed if we don't take advantage of this great RB class and if we settle for Jet and Asiata as RB #1 and #2.
That's not true at all. Article on Nov 12th, T_D had been advocating Milo as PS for months before the election.
Very important to call out their bullshit but it should not consume our attention and focus like such things often do. Dozens of top posts on this are not needed when real estate on T_D is so important. Which of course has been a problem for so very long and no end of it in sight.
How is blatantly disregarding Federal law not automatically qualify them for immediate dismissal? I'd take that but arrest them too.\n\nBoggles the mind that this wasn't already a thing, how could it not be?
What could her words possibly mean? Motives unclear.\n\nWhen will the cucks wake the fuck up? They're very open and say it over and over again right to our faces they want to conquer the West and make us all Muslim countries.
Oh I agree and don't have a better word to fit that's funny but point still stands right? Kekland, Kekville...yeah, retarded.
There's no way they can refuse him now. They will do everything they possibly can to make this a photo op that paints Sweden and the refugees in a positive light. Gov officials will keep a close eye on him and attempt to coerce him into looking here but not there. Whether Tim will follow along or not remains to be seen but there's zero doubt they'll do their best to make this not look bad.
Tfw you want to move to Tx (or another based Southern state) but hate heat, have work to move to Portland, love the weather and the outdoors of the PNW but it's the mecca of cucks...
And that kids, is how Zoe Quinn got Donald Trump elected President and saved Western civilization. \n\nNot even a stretch. Without the veteran meme warriors from GG I doubt we'd have been so quick to rally and see through the bullshit in the beginning where Trump needed momentum; it might have been too late.
And just think of where we'd be now and in the future with King Cuck elected. If Trudeau is a 1 in leadership, Bernie is a 2.\n\nThank Kek they robbed Bernie. I think Trump won the popular vote in a landslide but if the cheated just as hard for Bernie as they did Hillary, he would have won. 
Doing Kek's work lad, proud of you.
Brady for Peterson who says no? They do have Garoppolo so we might also be able to get their 1st too...well, least a 2nd or 3rd they'd surely throw in.
But we'd have to pay a replacement so that savings is cut in half. Zero reason to cut Wright to save so little even with Patterson back. An injury away from significant playing time and we still have no idea if Treadwell is any good yet. \n\nCutting him next season makes sense money-wise though.\n\n 
Perhaps not due to his age. You'd think that rules out most teams who aren't playoff contenders and plus, doubt he'd chose a shit team for a lil more money but who knows.
Don't agree at all. Shill accusations should have more evidence than a single comment (unless egregious obviously, e.g. clear racism). Far too many equate going against T_D hive mind as being a shill or "concern troll". \n\nDoesn't the label "concern troll" go against what we stand for? As a long member of the community should I not be allowed to have my own opinions and open them up for debate if they go against the hive mind? Should I have to convince the mods I'm not a shill because someone here doesn't agree with me?\n\nTake some time to check their history is my point before you deport. Obviously if much/most of their comments are these types then of course deport.\n\nAnd shit, karma whores who make 20-30+ posts a day of nothing but low effort circle jerking shit and reposts make a bigger impact against us than comments we can just downvote and call out with a better argument. Deporting them would have a far greater positive impact but guess that's none of my business...
> we Americans fought for 100 years to make this country what she is\n\nWhich is exactly why the "muh country of immigrants" is a bullshit argument. Not comparable when the country is now long built and the greatest on earth. How is it's a privilege to move to a great country so difficult to comprehend?
I dunno, I'm not convinced we don't need another 100 Milo posts...
$1.1m more is not a "much higher salary".\n\n
But comments can be easily downvoted, called out, and given a counter argument to.\n\nCountering the posts I'm referring to and their effectiveness against us simply cannot be without mod intervention or a complete turnaround by us, the community, to say enough is enough and downvote reposts, low effort shit posts, and karma whores while holding ourselves to a higher standard by upvoting quality. Unless either happen, nothing will change and again, it's been going on for well over 6 months so not holding my breath.\n\nI get that high energy and humor is what's made this community into what it is but the posts I'm talking about are not at all related to either. In fact I'd argue it goes directly against both. Why take the time to post quality or an OC top tier meme when all you have to do to reap that sweet sweet karma is circlejerk?
What cucks don't realize is by encouraging and allowing immigrants to not assimilate, speak English, they are destined to low wage / poverty. Without English one's opportunities are extremely limited. \n\nBut nah, reality doesn't make me feel as good in helping them spit on the thought of assimilation because fuck America, live here and soak up all of the advantages but you should totally love and pledge your allegiance to Mexico...or any foreign land while you live here because what could go wrong with such a belief? I mean, fuck white America anyways so yeah.
"James Woods Gets High/Drunk and Plays Video Games"\n\nI want my small but fair cut James.
Muslim suffixes to describe the land of Kek seems so very wrong.
Fully expect another good year with moderately better numbers so if we don't lock him up now, he'll be in for a big payday in '18. The year after will be Diggs' big payday, among other big contracts we'll have to give, so the value of a #2WR and having to pay him (near) top #2WR money isn't nearly as attractive.\n\nAnd so, the choice isn't as easy as it seems to be. If Treadwell played well I think you'd have to take a 2nd for him and even now, have to seriously consider it.
"You see, it's all well and good when *I* claim to have sources, trust me..."
Why is it they make their way across safe country after safe country to get to the UK or Sweden? Hmm...now why are they all trying to get to the two countries that give out the most welfare? Motives unclear.\n\nHow fucking disgusting is it to swarm to these countries to get free money and treat their citizens in such a way? Demand more and more while openly hating the native culture and saying you're going to turn their lands into Muslim lands?\n\nOut altruism is being used as a weapon against us. Give them hand outs while they'd be quick to chop ours off.
People forget that even with his mobility and wizardry of escaping the pocket, Teddy essentially never took advantage of doing so with a big play downfield. Was extremely conservative.\n\nThis year was actually huge for Teddy and the Vikings. Does he take the next step and improve year 3 or not? A big blow because we still have, or should have, questions about Teddy fulfilling his potential as a franchise QB. Now all signs point to the Vikings not finding that out.
Don't necessarily agree because I fully expect he has an even better year this season. Even if not by much but a moderate OL improvement and more chemistry with Sam makes it a safe bet. Doing so will get him the current mid-top range for #2WR money.\n\nThink paying him now would be a hefty discount compared to what he'd make next season; especially on the open market and cap increase.\n\nWouldn't be a bad move taking less now instead of risking injury for him, though. Put some incentives in so he can still make close to what he would have.
In a sane world that would be a worse term than "illegal aliens" as it implies an invading outside force. 
"Hey guys, I think we should fuck up Flint's water because as gov officials we're part of the system and of course, fuck black people."\n\n"Sounds great Bill, I vote in favor."\n\n"Yeah, count me in."\n\n"Wait everyone, there's white people who live there too."\n\n"Oh shit that's right, ABORT ABORT ABORT!"
"Nah but see, they're private companies so it's okay and it doesn't matter if they're platforms are huge and deeply embedded in modern society. They should totes be allowed to propagandize the masses with full impunity. I mean, you can just like not use their product or something if you don't like it and let them continue to brainwash others unchallenged." - idiot apologists of massive corporate control over our minds
All fine and good but my point is to make the masses who consider themselves "liberals/Democrats" pick a side because their parties and politicians throughout the West have been hijacked by extremist SJW ideology and already have chosen for them. \n\nYou're either a leftist extremist SJW or you're no longer a liberal. Think it's a great tactic to use because not only is it true but it'll force people to look into and realize what the liberal/Democrat parties have actually become. And as we all know, SJW are a very tiny insane minority but it is what liberal politicians champion and applaud now. You're either for or against that bullshit. Keep driving the wedge between them; they're doing well enough on their own but we can surely help.
If so how about your Mother or sister takes a walk alone at night in a migrant enriched neighborhood? What could go wrong in one of the safest places on earth, eh?
Even if they were a private uni, fuck that.\n\nHow can they openly aid and abet illegal aliens? How can these school administrations, mayors, and governors just go "lol fuck your federal laws I do what I want!"? How are gov officials who do not automatically open to dismissal? \n\nArrests need to start happening. You don't get to choose what laws you follow. You don't just get to waste taxpayer money from citizen on illegals because it makes you feel warm and fuzzy inside. Crackdown on this shit and hard President Trump.
It's my first day, absolutely blows my mind they'd blame Trump for this (it doesn't).
There is no room for "classical liberals", liberalism has been hijacked by the extreme left. You are either an extreme leftist, ergo a liberal, or you are not.\n\nThis can be seen by what the so called "liberal" party here, in the EU, and Canada champion as policies and the extreme SJW identity politics they applaud. \n\n"Leftists" aka the extreme left = Liberals now. Once again they've co-opted words and definitions so we should refer to them as such, a liberal/Democrat means you are an extreme leftist SJW. \n\nThis is what it means to be a "liberal" in current year so you're either an extremist or you're no longer a "liberal" or "Democrat". We should make them chose sides because their parties have already done so for them.
Unleash the useful idiots muahahahaha
> Hey Trump\n\n> Cash Me Outside \n\n> How Bow Dah\n\nFuck does that even mean?
Fucking this. FB and tweet these stories constantly at them and fake outrage at how racist they are.
Congrats to you all? We fucking get it.\n\nYes FB/Twitter/ect is a shithole but we need to fucking stop discouraging 'pedes from fighting the good fight on social media. \n\nThese are the motherfucking front lines of the propaganda war and they'd love nothing more than for us to retreat to let them continue to manipulate the masses unchallenged.\n\nSo yeah, congrats on realizing it doesn't positively affect your life, huge revelation, but **we should absolutely 100% be encouraging our fellow pedes and meme warriors to fight on the front lines that literally is on the social media giants. Discouraging others from continuing to fight or take up arms is heresy. If we retreated away into our safe spaces Trump would have never fucking won so those who put up with all the bullshit and fought for truth should be reverend and commended by us all**. 
We were divided on taking the reported 1st from ARZ a couple years ago. Was a no brainer imo given his price tag and age for a 1st and one of the potential replacements I wanted was DJ. sadpepe.png
FUCK YOU FOR TRIGGERING ME!!!\n\nSeriously though, gave up on following the new album since it's been what, about two years when supposedly Maynard had the lyrics and the crew was in the studio?\n\nI look at it this way, we're so very VERY lucky Tool is still around and will make another album. Have to figure it's their last so I'm all for them taking their time. Don't rush genius. Side note, Kek do I wish Maynard scraped his focus on Puscifer for APC (and Tool of course), would've loved another album or two.
Maybe he was playing the double agent?
Yeah, I mean they are private companies so should totally be allowed to brainwash and propagandize their views of reality onto the masses. 
Yep, tell all those Swedish girls their sexual assault and rape was just "make believe". Over 1000 New Year's Eve just the year before last. Hundreds at music festivals. And it's so bad police tell women not to go out alone at night due to the chance of rape/sexual assault. So bad their government and media covers it up, risking the safety of their own citizens. Fuck all of them because that's against my constructed narrative, right? \n\nOh and Milo's video was edited if you care about the truth (lol). Milo was sexually abused as a boy and used humor/deflection to coup but yeah, lets totally attack the guy who was sexually abused because we disagree with him. But nah, don't even bother to check the unedited video. Why bother right? So much easier to be told what to believe.\n\nAnd you people talk about being all inclusive and tolerant. Only to those who conform to your beliefs and only to woman and children not abused by illegals or muslims because well, can't let anything against our narrative come to light.\n\nYou can't prove anything I've said is wrong but I'll be downvoted and banned because current year facts and the truth is "hate speech". Who is suppose to be the fascists again? \n\nI await the what's so very predictable...Prove I'm wrong, do it. Try. Truth should prevail over any narrative should it not? Nm, even if everything I say is true I'm just a Nazi so kill the messenger and ignore that we live in reality that holds uncomfortable truths.
The insanity of their fake outrage was long before Trump mentioned this, though.
No, to MN silly.
Think with all the counter measurements it's time we give up on trying to make /all. That's to say, if it happens it happens. \n\nTop priority being that we make our top 25-50 posts the highest of quality red pills, news and commentary you won't see anywhere else, and only top tier memes for those on the outside who wander in for a peek. \n\nWe can't expect them to dig any farther than that and what fucking good does so many reposts and shitposts do?\n\nBelieve if mods took that approach by using stickies like they once did, not to get to /all, but in an attempt to make our front page or two the highest of quality is the best way we move forward. The huge news and best posts of the day won't need help via sticky and thus still have a chance to make it to /all. \n\nIt's all about the outsiders who take a peek inside and giving them the best chance to be repilled and join us, it's not about circlejerking/karmawhoring the same topic to T_D hivemind that are already here. Best chance to do so is doing our best to make sure the front page or two are only the highest of quality.
It can be stopped, just a matter of how far they're willing to go. We shall see soon enough as these countries are pushed to the brink.
And yet these are the types that need trigger warnings for words and safe spaces.\n\nBut nah, not at all terrifying or terrible for a girl walking down the street in her once safe homeland and a group of migrants walking towards her after all that's been going on. Nah, the police aren't telling women they shouldn't be out after dark because the chances of rape or sexual assault. Not nearly as terrifying as manspreading on the subway.
And shit, Teddy never took advantage of AD off of play-action with big plays. I'd be curious to see what Sam could have down and I'm sure it wouldn't be close but alas, moving on from AD is optimal going forward.
The platforms are too large and pervasive in what our society has become. FB/Twitter/reddit/ect are the front lines of this war, this war on the minds of the masses. They'd want nothing more than for us to surrender and retreat to our safe lil spaces leaving them to manipulate unchallenged.\n\nKnowing this, because of this anyone who advocates to turn tail and leave the front lines of social media is an auto downvote. We should be 100% encouraging everyone to join the ranks, to fight on the front lines. Trump was a great victory for our future but only one battle, this war is far greater than him. This war wages on with no end in sight. It will take decades at least to claim victory. \n\n
I've seen 2 comments total alluding to Milo apologizing and neither upvoted much at all.\n\nIt's actually posts like these that are the real shill posts that need to be countered, imo. It's not "concern troll" comments that can easily be downvoted and called out. Low effort circle jerks and reposts that get easily upvoted and spam our top 100 while quality posts are strategically downvoted and hidden. Whether mere karma whores or shills forum sliding the results are the same by clogging up our valuable real estate of visibility.\n\nOur upvotes are being used as a weapon against us by pandering to T_D circle jerk with spam diluting our focus via hyper focus and have been for many many months now with no end in sight...but that's none of my business.
Wouldn't doubt that it actually works better against those who see themselves as too smart to fall for it. Case in point the many highly educated people and professors who eat up liberal propaganda and flatly deny truth and reality. And that's their greatest trick, not believing they're falling for it and it's actually the other side that is.\n\nFirst step is to admit that we all are vulnerable to emotional manipulation and confirmation bias.\n\nI'm somewhat well versed but can you just imagine the studies, experiments, and results from the top scientific minds throughout the world over the decades on the subject? 
And it's not exactly about changing the mind of an insane leftist, it's about the observers. They see you making common sense  rational arguments while all the other does is REEEEEEEEE. 
Being sentimental and not treating football like a business is how you don't win championships.
I'll have you know my IQ is 98 out of 100 so yeah, I'm literally a genious.
Only way to restructure Floyd is to extend him and he wouldn't take much less per year if we did. Do we commit now to save or let him prove it this season risking having to pay him more?
"Ugh! Those disgusting...incidents! I mean, there's so many of them though! Which one? Which one did you mean specifically?"\n\nHow cucked do you have to be to reach out and be all like, please clarify what terrible thing were you specifically talking about that's been going on in my country? There's so many but please tell me so we can think tank how to spin it so it doesn't look so terrible. \n\nUgh, I can't believe you shined a light on how we've failed our citizens and risk all their safety for...no fucking reason at all that comes close to justifying it.\n\nTrump is a big bully for spreading the truth about Sweden when?
And yet most don't even realize or won't acknowledge we also have a problem with the 'chilling effect' in our own community. \n\nHow often have you seen accusations of someone being a shill or people prefacing their thought with "not a concern troll (check my history) but..."? Having your own opinion that goes against our hivemind is the same even if it's not as vitriol as the left's. \n\n"You disagree with us? Bet they're a pedo."\n\nHarsh truths about us are met with the similar resistance. Disagreeing or giving your thoughts on what's best for us moving forward just might get you deported for being a "concern troll" (and again, the label leads to self censorship). Does that not go against everything we supposedly are?
If we'd have retreated into our own lil safe space instead of fighting them on their home turf would Trump have won? Fuck no.\n\nA boycott is a catch-22 but it's clear what's far more important to win the war and that's winning the hearts and minds of the masses by dropping red pills. The former will take care of the later, they will crumble when we open their eyes and the only way to do so is fight on the front lines.
Equating us to leftists is a poor and lazy comparison that doesn't tackle any of points beyond the superficial. Mentioned it's not as vitriol but the similarities remain.\n\nYou didn't address at all the 'chilling effect' (self censorship) I described nor how quick we are to call those who disagree are shills or in the case of public figures, "they're totes pedo fuckers". If you don't see the similarities I guess I don't know what to say.\n\nDo tell me, can I freely make a post about these concerns or my opinions on how to make our community better? Shit, wait, that's actually against the rules. Wait, guess they changed the rule but it surely was for a long time that we can't question the mods nor the direction of our sub, instead "take it to mod mail" because yeah, that totes isn't the chilling effect I mentioned. They surely will address your concerns. \n\nAnd shit, I was actually perma banned for calling out a user who literally made 220 posts in a 24 hr period a week before the election asking wtf are the mods doing about spam? Pointed it out because clearly it's the best and obvious tactic shills use against us, spam the fuck out of us with circle jerking easily upvoted low effort posts while strategically downvoting quality posts. And it continues on to this day whether mere karma whores or shills the effect remains the same. Had to plead my case to remove my perma ban and [**here's the post that was so horrendous it got me perma banned...**](https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/5an7gz/user_uand_n_made_220_posts_in_a_24_hour_period/)\n\nEDIT: funny, thought I called out blue swede shoes actually for spamming (absolutely was one of the most prolific) and yet both of them hardly post at all compared to the days/weeks leading up to the election, hmm I wonder why...\n\n\n\n
Existing designs no longer exist for construction workers to build, though. 
2 year deal with all guaranteed money in '17 so we can cut him free and clear after this season.\n\nLT in the 1st round in '18. A year to groom or start if Whitworth falls off a cliff.\n\nBest plan imo that doesn't include a trade. No thanks on settling for a below avg starter long term and paying them $7m-10/yr. No thanks to banking on a mid 2nd draft pick in an poor OT class. \n\nWhitworth is the key piece to completely turn around our OL into a top 10 group in '17...with a Wagner signing as well. Who else at LT would you even want? A few guys but they're all risky or shown to be below average. I'd definitely risk counting on Whitworth playing well for one year over committing to any of them. \n\n
And holy fucking shit, a gay publication is defending this and titled this story as [**This video of a young boy twerking at Pride has homophobes outraged -- White supremacists post video as 'proof civilisation is crumbling'**](http://www.gaystarnews.com/article/video-young-boy-twerking-pride-has-homophobes-outraged150615/)\n\nBecause I *must* be an "outraged homophobe" for thinking a boy who must be 10yo shouldn't be fucking twerking sexually at a Pride event nor praised for doing so?\n\nClearly I must be a "White supremacist" for thinking this is fucking wrong?\n\nIt'd totes be okay if a 10yo girl twerked in front of a bunch of old hetero men at an event that's clearly for expressing sexuality, right?\n
How many more years do people need to realize that Kalil *is* a bottom 10 guy?\n\nHis rookie was a fluke because he faced overall poor competition. Time to move on and not settle for below avg at arguably the second most important position in football.
I can't but stay strong friend. You know and can feel it inside the path you are on now is that of good. Takes courage and proud of you. Hope you have a support system already but you are welcomed with open arms here.
Yep, thats *exactly* what I'm trying to say in a thread about Whitworth. smh
> Trump was using fake internal memos to help catch the leaker\n\nYes and that's the oldest trick in the book to catch a mole, ffs. Changing small details in a story to see what is reported. Zero credit is due and lends no credibility when many know this and also stated this obvious tactic.\n\nInsider knowledge of those closest to Trump is extremely different than hearing about a coordinated media attack against Milo. A random MSM blogger could be privy to stories written to be published the next day. Hell, some cuck journalist on twitter could've mentioned their article going live tomorrow. \n\n
A 7th rounder can never be considered a bust. Probably move that up to 5th rounders even when simply making the team makes it a good pick (coulda shoulda taken X not withstanding).\n\nDraft position is key to applying the "bust" label and how big. 
Yeah, it irks me every time because any thread that mentions FB it's highly upvoted and parroted.\n\nCool, congrats? Yes, it's a shithole and you're likely better off, we all know this already ol' wise one, but quit fucking discouraging others from fighting the good fight.\n\nGenerally speaking, truth is you can't make a fraction of the impact circle jerking in T_D echo chamber as you could going straight into the lion's den motivated with an arsenal of red pills and moxie. 
It's not a big deal at all when women do it to young boys unlike when disgusting men do it to young girls, shitlord! That's why women don't get close to the same punishment when they did it, so duh.
The more you're outside and/or reject the social norm the more you strictly conform within your sub group. \n\nRather fascinating these in-group dynamics. Seems the more outside the "norm" one is (gay, minorities, social "rejects", etc) the more one's entire identity becomes wrapped up in what makes you different. Seeking out those similar to you even if that difference is really all you have in common. Feeling that need to fit in, rejecting outsiders, and thus losing who you are in a sense by conforming yourself to the group.\n\nSadly many still see themselves as fringe groups who need to stick together because they're unable to be accepted by the majority when that's simply no longer the case. \n\nI've wondered if there's a "follower gene". Hard to believe there isn't without ignoring the evidence of how so many just follow along once in a social group and with those who won't.
Moving forward we need to be the main hub for news and commentary you won't see anywhere else. We're in an information war and getting out things you won't see elsewhere is big but even more so perhaps, our greatest strength might be our commentary, our outspoken views and arguments that crush the narratives not allowed and censored.\n\nI understand and believe the "high energy" was key to what we've become but imo the circle jerking now directly goes against it. We used to have god-tier OC memes but now it's 99% low effort reposts. Think it's directly related to the karma whore epidemic, why be creative in hopes to get to the front page when all you have to do is "TFW no Pepe" and insert the most common Pepe? Why take the time to make a quality posts when all you have to do is post an obvious and circle jerking statement that should be comment and reap 1000+ karma? Or just make another repost of the top news? Least for me it's made me less inclined to even bother and with the lack of OC and creativity compared to the golden age of the primaries I think it's proof.\n\n
"We saw nothing wrong with the phrasing until we received backlash."
Saying you're being attacked by shills is an easy way to reap that sweet sweet karma. \n\nShit, almost forgot to make my 20th post today titled "We are being brigaded, post things that trigger CTR!" and insert a pic of a hot girl in a bikini. That'll surely show them and red pill the onlookers. imhelping.jpg. Totes my only motivation and not at all to karma whore or cos I'm a shill trying to distract...\n\nEDIT: Wouldn't doubt it's a shill tactic to easily acquire a top comment. Whether it is or merely a karma whore the results are the same. You see it so often it should really make you wonder. Shit, if you ever reference CTR/Share Blue the top post or included in yours should be a link to who they are and what they do because it's not about telling us what we already know (circle jerking), it's about red pilling those who might be peeking in and who actually don't know (red pilling them). Can't rely on cucks to make a simple google search so actually linking would increase the probability immensely. But what do I know?

Far beyond merely lying, this is fucking propaganda. Just another attempt at making Trump's opposition appear far greater than it is.
Should lay off a bit on the parent bashing when peers, the internet, and school have a far greater influence. Their influence is unlike ever before. I'm sure many of these types came from great homes but there's only so much you can do when a kid hits the insane teen years and want desperately to stick out and also fit in. Sadly to not conform they end up strictly conforming within their social group.
If you think someone should be banned the least you can do is take a few mins to vet them.\n\nAgain, the REAL problem is our motherfucking upvotes are being used against us via forum sliding with so many spam shitposts and it's been bad for 6+ months. It's NOT some "concern troll" comments that can easily be downvoted by the community and called out.\n\nThis is the real tactic of the shills that hurt us and why it's so "difficult" for many to see. Check their history and they're frequent posters who do nothing but circle jerk so again, they look the part of a T_D poster and pass the shill sniff test. \n\nWant to make a real difference? Ban karma whoring faggots who make 20+ posts in a given day. Not sure if possible but if T_D could limit users to only 5 posts per day, less maybe for new users, and with possible exceptions for making more, you'd really be combating shills.

Eh, agree but sometimes you need a douche as a coach and a HOF player whose been there done that makes the guys fully buy into what he's trying to teach. Also makes them work harder to impress him. Of course not sure he'd be a good coach or if that'd be the case with CC and our guys but a reasonable assumption.
So, just one article makes it a nefarious CIA conspiracy? Was all the support given here for Milo to be PS astroturf? We pushed that far harder than one article ever could and Milo never had a chance to be PS in the first place.. \n\nEDIT: Deleted comment below was OP (by himself or mod???) claiming this article was what first got the thought of Milo for PS going for himself and many people here. Called that out for being absolutely untrue because T_D pushed Milo for PS for many months prior to the election but seems my reply doesn't show unless you click permalink. \n\nBut yeah, love how we just fucking eat up 4chan posts with "I know something (no larp here)" as insider information instead of being just some random's theory that many can believe. Hmm, confirmation bias? But questioning and pointing out leaps in the logic gets downvotes.
Sliding is easily their most effective tactic against T_D and has been for many, many months now.\n\nBombard post of circle jerks, reposts, and other low effort shit for easy upvotes while strategically downvoting quality posts. Which goes hand in hand with topic dilution (we need 100s of Milo posts right?) or to the same effect, hyper focus. Tons of circle jerking comments that get easy upvotes that can break up or hide informative discussions.\n\nCan't stop the huge news of the day right? Welp, lets make a bunch of reposts on the topic along with low effort shitposts so their focus remains very narrow. Think of the impact one person could make with only 5 alt accounts doing this.
Think if we tender him at a 2nd it'd be because we want the pick. Only saves us $1.1m from a 1st round tender so reason not to if we want to keep him.
(Hmm, the_donald and 4chan have come to a conclusion that's very plausible, how can I piggyback and interject myself into this to be relevant, oh I know...)\n\n> Multiple sources within the WH have told me that the "memo" on the 100K National Guard soldiers was fake news designed to smoke out leaker. \n\n#\n\n> Sources reveal to me and only me, that the Berkeley Mayor personally gave the stand down order to the police.\n\nAmong many more I'm sure.\n\n

Create memes that it's okay to have sex with a 6yo in Islam because Muhammad did. "Nu-uh, he didn't fuck his child bride until she was 9 shitlord!"
Can't blame it all on them though. It's not just shills who auto upvote low effort circle jerks and reposts. The battle is on /new where shills get the ball rolling by upvoting shit and we follow along while they also strategically downvote quality posts. \n\nBeen saying it for over 6 months how this is the obvious tactic they use to make a big impact against us and yet nothing is done when it's easy to combat. \n\nJust check out some user pages and you'll commonly see them posting 20-30 times per day of low effort shit. Not even an exaggeration, I saw one who made 220 posts in 24hrs in the weeks leading up to the election. Are they merely karma whores or shills? Either way the impact is the same. \n\nJust imagine one person with 5 accounts posting that often. All low effort easy upvoted circle jerks and sprinkle in some "fellow kids" comments to pass the shill sniff test. Spamming 4/10 posts that forum slide 9+/10 posts make a big difference against us. Can't always stop the biggest news of the day but you sure can spam it up reposting the same story and with low effort shit.\n\nIt's crucial we keep our top 25-50 as the best quality posts to red pill those who may wonder in for a peak. Can't expect them to dig far and what good does 5 reposts and low effort shit do? \n\nThough it still gets old it doesn't irk me that much anymore but holy fuck was it extremely frustrating in the weeks leading up to such a huge election.

No. PizzaGate refers to the pizza code in the Podesta emails, not any specific pizza place (and besides Comet, a European ping pong pizza place, the pizza boat, all are implicated, it's not just Comet). PedoGate suggests that it is much larger of an issue than just Podesta, true, but Pizza is a big part of the story. \n\nBoth \\#PizzaGate and \\#PedoGate are good hashtags IMO and should both be deployed.

It's the FDA who sets drug scheduling policy. DEA just enforces it. \n\nAnd yes, with a simple EO it is well within the authority of President Trump to order the FDA to look at all the evidence that show marijuana does not fall under the definition of Schedule 1 drugs: that it has no medicinal value. \n\nIn fact, just looking at the classification schedule tells you all you need to know. LSD and similar drugs can be used to treat depression and PTSD in veterans. Marijuana has been used to treat several maladies, including severe Parkinson's and certain types of seizures. \n\nOn the other hand, pharmaceuticals with a high amount of abuse in this country are classified at a much lower restriction than the schedule 1 drugs - look at the list of Schedule 4 drugs for example. All widely abused pharmaceuticals. \n\nFrom the DEA's webpage: \n\nSchedule I\n\nSchedule I drugs, substances, or chemicals are defined as drugs with no currently accepted medical use and a high potential for abuse. Some examples of Schedule I drugs are:\n\nheroin, lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD), marijuana (cannabis), 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (ecstasy), methaqualone, and peyote\n\nSchedule II\n\nSchedule II drugs, substances, or chemicals are defined as drugs with a high potential for abuse, with use potentially leading to severe psychological or physical dependence. These drugs are also considered dangerous. Some examples of Schedule II drugs are:\n\nCombination products with less than 15 milligrams of hydrocodone per dosage unit (Vicodin), cocaine, methamphetamine, methadone, hydromorphone (Dilaudid), meperidine (Demerol), oxycodone (OxyContin), fentanyl, Dexedrine, Adderall, and Ritalin\n\nSchedule III\n\nSchedule III drugs, substances, or chemicals are defined as drugs with a moderate to low potential for physical and psychological dependence. Schedule III drugs abuse potential is less than Schedule I and Schedule II drugs but more than Schedule IV. Some examples of Schedule III drugs are:\n\nProducts containing less than 90 milligrams of codeine per dosage unit (Tylenol with codeine), ketamine, anabolic steroids, testosterone\n\nSchedule IV\n\nSchedule IV drugs, substances, or chemicals are defined as drugs with a low potential for abuse and low risk of dependence. Some examples of Schedule IV drugs are:\n\nXanax, Soma, Darvon, Darvocet, Valium, Ativan, Talwin, Ambien, Tramadol\n\nSchedule V\n\nSchedule V drugs, substances, or chemicals are defined as drugs with lower potential for abuse than Schedule IV and consist of preparations containing limited quantities of certain narcotics. Schedule V drugs are generally used for antidiarrheal, antitussive, and analgesic purposes. Some examples of Schedule V drugs are:\n\ncough preparations with less than 200 milligrams of codeine or per 100 milliliters (Robitussin AC), Lomotil, Motofen, Lyrica, Parepectolin

I really support women breaking norms, rebelling against mainstream society, and bravely empowering themselves to reach their potential like the woman on the left. Many aspects of cultural conservatism objectively liberate and elevate women (and men) much better than a culture of no boundaries or rules.
We are entering a new era for sure. We're at the transition of a death and birth cycle for many aspects of society and culture. Elites are battling to maintain control of mass media and losing on many fronts.
Indeed. I certainly don't see the Trump Administration's agenda as having no compassion for the rest of the world. Just different ways of going about it than Bernie or globalists have proposed in some regards.\n\nI'm not exactly sure what's going on in his head or what he's hinting at. I doubt he's the kind to join Antifa, maybe the totally "grassroots" Resist movement though. He knows we wouldn't reject him if he did. We never even talk politics. He just vaguely knows we support Trump. I think he was just venting anger about his car breaking down and just ranted on NPR rhetoric because he listens to it all day in his delivery job.

I have nothing against people criticizing Trump, his administration and supporters, but talking about violence against those you disagree with is way over the line. I don't like it when I occasionally hear Trump supporters even joking about violence towards the left either. It's rare, but still very unproductive. We need civll discussion using reason more than ever between opposing viewpoints. We don't have any time for shouting matches of insults and violent threats.

My guess is a bunch of people were selected to submit questions and the ones who were approved were emailed a confirmation for their question, maybe with a modification on the phrasing. Which they were asked to read. Bernie could have been given some of these questions before hand, but I doubt it since he fucked up bad on the hairdressers question.
The illusion of free stuff is seductive.
http://blog.dilbert.com/post/156870325681/lady-gaga-master-persuader\n\nAccording to Dilbert Man her persuasion here was to start off with very traditional pro American tunes and presentation and then subtly hint with "Why don't you stay" to prime Trump supporter minds to be open to less restrictive immigration. So that in the future her statements about immigration and other issues might be better received by Trump supporters, as well as the commercials with political themes.\n\nIt was definitely a brilliant strategy, but I really don't think she was sincere.
Teenage Part time jobs, volunteer orgs, private sports teams, etc are all infinitely more valuable at creating social skills applicable to adulthood than the kind learned at public school.
#WE LIKE FLYNN. PUT HIM BACK IN!
The same thing you tell your son. If they want to work for a large company, you have to negotiate your salary confidently with the skills to deserve it and change employers every 5 years or so in some fields in order to gain new experience and negotiate for a higher salary. That's just how large companies work.
The only reason this kid is doing this is because hes well aware of the federal shit storm that is about to rain down upon them. Hes an admitted gang member. Lock him up and throw away the key. 
Regardless of what you think about the man he had a good point. The_donald's success IMO is largely due to its humor and positivity that accompanies the harder red pills about why globalism isn't the way to go. \n\nWe have some damn funny memes and they work. The first time I came here back in June I was expecting you all to be brain dead haters, but instead what I found was a bunch of intelligent, truth-seekers having a blast and promoting patriotism not only for America, but a sincere hope for EVERY nation to get their shit together and become greater than ever before.\n\nThere's a time and place for physical force, but positive humor via memes or whatever really is a more effective weapon in many instances.
It is insane to not be strongly against illegal immigration. It hurts everyone especially the immigrants. Crossing the border can be extremely dangerous. Attempting to live outside the system makes everything much harder and risky legally, while requiring you to break serious laws just to get by. Law and order is simply the only sane and compassionate way to go.
Leftists can be converted to conservatism. Some are lefties for life, but maybe not as much as you'd think. Being married, employed and having a kid tends to make both men and women much more conservative. That's over half the battle.
Why was Cruz picked for this debate? What are Ted's views on healthcare anyways? Something about this seems kind of odd. Why now? It feels like a set up for a coordinated media attack on Trump.
I think it should be fully legal, but I have zero interest in using it myself. i doubt its universally a net benefit for all people, but it is for some. So let everybody figure it out for themselves.
You're probably right. In the least some lobbying limits may get passed, but our best bet is to keep pressing forward on a grassroots level through www.represent.us which is trying to change lobbying laws on city, county, and state levels across the country.
I'm fond of MAGA-American though.

This EO could have been a little more detailed to prevent some of this inconvenience for green card holders and these combat interpreters. But in the end this will only be a moderate inconvenience to some. Nobody is being totally screwed over. Those who deserve to be here will be sorted out.
Fake news hysteria BTFO
Serious question: why don't Muslim refugees simply masturbate when they are having their "sexual emergency? 
Cool, tell us a story about your experience with based Ben please!
They will be free to go at any time to Mexico through the wall's big beautiful door. Getting citizenship there is probably unlikely though.
Not a civil war. Just civil unrest. But don't give up hope yet. Spread facts and sources as much as you can. Remain civil. We still have a good chance to red pill large amounts of people currently mind controlled by MSM. We got this. People are waking up.
My guess is to create a news cycle of bashing the Trump administration on healthcare. Maybe collect some sound bytes to twist and make it seem like there is internal chaos within the Republican Party.
It's still not that simple. Cartels have diversified their income streams a long time ago beyond drugs. They are like the Mafia now. Marijuana in particular would barely put a dent in their income. Although I'm still for decriminalization of most drugs and instead investing more money in rehab centers.
Also we don't counter protest. There's no need for that. Stay away from riots. Only law enforcement in riot gear are equipped legally and physically to deal with these psychopaths.
Do you think a border wall and tougher enforcement of US immigration laws will put enough pressure on Mexican politics to change for the better? Or what else is needed? Sincerely wish the best to Mexico. 
Its recreational outrage.
Trump's presidency is going to help so many developmentally delayed special snowflakes grow up. Probably won't give him the credit though.
Nice shill account m8. Working for David Brock is not a real job. \n\nLet me give you some tips: If you want to infiltrate this sub don't make it so obvious.
The implication is that it would be justified to remove funding if offenses like this became regular and more severe. Sounds reasonable to me. Trump says controversial things like this to get the nation thinking and discussing the topic to further the debate. He has always done this and always will.
FINISH THEM ASSANGE.
did you just assume my gender? 
So a Muslim immigrant burns a Trump supporters hair. Jesus H christ I can't wait to see how the msm tries to spin this one. 
Trump ain't startin no war. Tillerson was chosen to make the transition away from Middle East interventionism to energy independence and much more domestic manufacturing. There's going to be a little bit of posturing with countries like Iran and China, but nothing remotely close to a war, just some renegotiating of relations during this geopolitical interest transition to more nationalism and less globalism. Not isolationism, just a higher degree of independence in many areas.
Calling anyone you don't like a NAZI or Hitler is just lazy thinking. I think they should be branded as far left terrorists, or just simply domestic terrorists.
Very true. 1984 was one of Jim Jones favorite books. A psychotic freak who convinced a bunch of poor people that he could create a socialist utopia for them. (He didn't)

That's why extreme vetting is completely reasonable. Do you want sharia law? If yes, entry denied. No exceptions.
Hell no! Over 30% voted trump. These insane coastal cities have no right to the rest of the state. We stand our ground. Retreating is not an option. If we can hold our position we will win the long game when these cities crumble under the weight of their own stupidity. Maybe after they've been humbled they'll accept someone like Peter Thiel to govern them back to a functioning society.
Elon Centipede now.
More likely I think he's a Romney and Koch brother puppet. Their agenda overlaps with Soros a little bit though.
Extreme vetting for rapists please. Not sure how'd they vet for that in a failed state without much criminal records though. So entire families only if at all. None of this young single male bullshit. It doesn't take a psychology phd to understand that is asking for rape.
Has Pizzagate ruined pizza for anybody else? It's honestly going to be awhile until I have an appetite for it again.

Think of it as an opportunity amigos. Millions of new workers could be put to good use on infrastructure throughout Mexico.
Schools should be teaching teens about the Barbary and other slave trades around the world during the 1700-1800's. Understanding the reality of the universality of slavery and how Western civilization was the main force behind ending it in many areas of the world. The truth about the history of slavery should make nearly every white person proud for their ancestor's role in abolishing it.
Amazing! It's a lefty indoctrination manual. Like some kind of communist manifesto.
Comparative Religion studies is a good topic for a World History class. But it's really hard to discuss it on a 6th grade level that wouldn't end up being propaganda or break separation of church and state in a public school.
Don't counter protest guys. It's not worth it. Let law enforcement in riot gear herd these Soros cattle.
His sister was also expelled earlier for saying she wanted to blow up the school. Apparently their dad was encouraging them to pull these stunts to raise controversy. The parents were using their kids for some kind of 4d Islam PR chess. Not cool. \n\nGavin Mcinnes explained it in this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2R5peL26L-U).
Yep, it was when welfare essentially didn't exist. My Swedish ancestors immigrated to Minnesota and worked their ass off as farmers all day long for two generations.
Rand Paul knows how to be a senator.

 The "Make _____ Great Again" nationalistic movement is about positivity and civility. Anybody advocating or contemplating violence against civilians has nothing to do with us. That has never been part of our rhetoric and never will.\n\nWe want all people and nations to thrive including Muslims. Especially ones in areas that globalists like Obama and Hillary allowed to be destroyed. We want limited immigration from these areas not because we hate them, but because we want them to be great again. We support safe zones and immigration to Saudi Arabia because many more refugees can be helped and have a much better chance at a dignified and meaningful life. We want to help MORE refugees, not less. Just in a more effective way than immigration to the West. \n\nTo refugees already here we want to get along peacefully until it's time to return. Anybody with any other intentions. GET HELP. You are sick and on the road to hell.
Love Trump's Choice (I do)
Good point. It's a fair assumption that his administration utilizes the_donald for that purpose. We executive branch now.
Cuckerberg is very likely planning on running for president at some point. The Centipedes Watch must make sure that this maniac never gets into the whitehouse.
Also don't approach the angry mobs. Don't even go near them. It serves no purpose, except for photo ops that fake news will try to twist as Trump supporters inciting a riot of an otherwise "peaceful" protest.
I'd recommend picking your battles wisely. Unless you absolutely love high school my advice to most decently intelligent teenagers is to get your GED and move on. Apply for college, learn a trade or start a business. Something ambitious in the real world. Public education is a very inefficient way to learn and prepare for a productive adulthood for someone with a drive.
If you are attending an event that could be raided by rioters have a clear get away path designated before arriving. DO NOT ENGAGE. Do not counter protest. Get the hell out of there! Or hide inside a safe building until the freaks are gone if necessary. Its not being a coward. Its playing the long game, which we can and will win.
Cities with nice year round climates are magnets for vagabonds and free spirits. I think its fine to ban urban camping (including in cars). There are plenty of hippie communes these people can go live in if they want to live simply and free with more dignity.\n\nThat being said the Air BnB stuff is just virtue signaling. I doubt they will follow through much on their offer to illegal immigrants.
She's not wrong. I'm not religious in the least but it's clear to me this country needs to get its ass back in church. If not literally then figuratively. We need to rebuild our institutions religious or otherwise that create family oriented community and promote basic values of decency.
I don't think its possible to defeat ISIS unfortunately. Just blow up the weapons that Obama let fall into their hands (whether intentionally or not) and call it good.
Psychopaths. Anything but liberal. These people don't value liberty at all.
###TRUMP 2020, BUILD THE SPACE ELEVATOR, KEEP HER LOCKED UP, KEEP THE SWAMP DRAINED
Lefty Pope can't distinguish between legal and illegal immigration. And especially can't comprehend the difference between young male economic migrants and actual refugees. Most of all he doesn't recognize that refugees do best long term in countries closest to their culture. Don't be like Lefty Pope.
Trump is just trying to bring attention to the lack of free speech at colleges. Its probably not an empty threat, but this is just how Trump operates. He moves the overton window to the topics he wants reform on by getting the public to consider the issue. He doesn't care if fake news freaks out, that's part of the 4D method.
#Seth Rich Lives!\n\nPatriots never die as long as they are remembered. Never forget. Never forgive those who kill to silence the truth.
He may have been a Bernie Bro, but this man died to make America great again the best way he knew how. He did not die in vain. America will be made greater than ever before in every way, including removing the type of election fraud that this patriot exposed.
That's really not even much of an exaggeration.
Turncoat? Nah, maybe a little virtue signaling though.
DO NOT go to protests to troll the left and get up close. This is exactly what they want. They are trying to mock conservative masculinity into showing up to fight, so they can call trump supporters violent. Don't take the b8 m8s.
I wouldn't want a head of state like Gaddafi, Sadam, or Assad in the US, but if I lived in their region I would greatly prefer their secular dictatorships to Sharia law under ISIS. I will never forgive or trust those who toppled these governments for their own gain and agenda with disregard for how it would impact Europe and innocent civilians in these countries.

As they should. Just say no to international fast food and junk food merchants. There's no legit reason why these companies should exist. Support small business, mom&pops and local chains over that globalist crap when it comes to eating out. They're more friendly, interesting, and usually only a little more expensive. I don't want to see a Starbucks or McDonalds when I travel to the other side of the world, I'd imagine the locals don't want them there either.

Thanks for the link.\n\n>The slowdown is primarily reflective of economic convergence and a developing country benefiting less from catch up growth as its economy matures\n\nI agree.

He is good. But I have 2 issues with him. \n\n1. During the campaign, he had underestimated the problems that faced India and said that the issues can be fixed within 90 days. He should talk about how his perception changed and what is his opinion now regarding timeline for fixing India's issues as a inside person. \n\n2. Communication. Mann ki baat is okay, but when is he going to take questions regarding issues that are important in general public's mind. Granted, he may disagree with media regarding what he sees as important issues, but he used social media very well during the campaign, could he not do the same now to be in touch with the public's mood?\n

Ya. Just finished watching. Even Rajini cannot save this movie.... All that talk about Rajini acting and Radhika Apte stole the show in just one scene! Some plot in the middle of huge holes!\n\nEdit: full disclosure. ..I have been a die hard FDFS fan since 1990
Damned if he does, damned if he doesn't!
You might say Trump pisses on Presstitudes?
No big deal... But that Is like saying Americans.... The fat ones, not the polite ones. Not every Indian wears a dot, not every American is fat. But stereotypes do stick in current society. 
If someone airs the right idea, encourage them. Cynicism goes nowhere randia!
Delayed due to land acquisition issues and politics of ownership!
What game is he playing?
However, could Hindi have replaced English as the second language?
The Chennai pitch was hiding right underneath all this time!
However, in the case of defense, they are also free to deploy defensive weapons. Why instead, they throw a tantrum?

I will keep posting it until it reaches the front page of the sub. They are ACTIVELY and INTENTIONALLY setting Trump up to die in jail. Strong words and dangerous intent. It's clear now the IC have been the Government for decades and US democracy is a sham.\n\nSpez: Someone else has posted 2 mins after me and it's gaining attention. They had a better title, admittedly! Just glad people are seeing it.
Streep thought he's in prison. She's a mentalist
4D chess being played by that motherfucker. 
Great find!
> *a fucking white male?*\n\nFTFY
They are ACTIVELY and INTENTIONALLY setting Trump up to die in jail. Strong words and dangerous intent. It's clear now the IC have been the real Government for decades and US democracy is a sham.\n\nI fear a JFK situation, though an assassination in the traditional sense likely won't happen, it'll be a character assassination with the view to disgrace him and put him in jail - just as effective for their endgame. With Trump ruined, this leaves the path clear to justify with no opposition to install a new and compliant figurehead. Figurehead being the important word here - because that's all they are; a talking head for the real Presidents - unelected ones, I hasten to add.\n\nHonestly I don't know how he can take these people on and win, especially knowing even the people close to him may be conspirators. Trump is our last hope against this fucking bullshit, if it all goes to fuck then that's it - IC is back in full charge as the shadow government and the globalist agenda steamrolls on.\n\nIt clicked with me back when he said it, but this quote is incredibly poignant now:\n\n*"This is not simply another four year election, this is a crossroads in the history of our civilization that will determine whether or not we the people will maintain control over our government."* \n\n- Donald Trump, October 2016
Lovely, thanks to you both. Ruth Bader Ginsburg - **you just made the list!**\n\nNeed more examples to BTFO liberals, get in here pedes.
As much as I hate failing SNL, comedy isn't ideal. It's a grey area - but what I find strange is how the audience is lapping it up. Wouldn't this skit be triggering for abuse victims, by their logic?
Damn, you called this perfectly. You should see my inbox right now - they're going nuts. I'm dropping evidence of definitions (can't believe I have to do this for grown adults with the use of Google) and its triggering them more. I knew liberals were lunatics but goddamn the mental disconnect on these people is astounding!

I know there's been a few accounts, but you're right, there's not a lot for that reason.\n\nIn case you haven't seen it, here's one from a secret service guy who had to deal with her: https://youtu.be/zbJe-Yelp-I
[Or it could be that you don't know what yellow bellied means](http://i.imgur.com/yp3VmZ9.jpg)\n\nBut you thought better to charge in shouting "RACISM", of course. That's the definition of 'liberalism'. People like you are the reason I left the left. Keep it up - there'll be plenty more doing the same as long as you do.
[I posted this yesterday, didn't get a great deal of attention](https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/5vcbdz/kim_cattrall_defends_roman_polanski_raping_a_13/.compact)
Saw that yesterday for the first time. Great shout. \n\n# WHOOPI - YOU JUST MADE THE LIST
Haha I know! My aim is to create an infographic/list for everyone to use to BTFO liberals targeting Milo.\n\nI have to say I think Milo was sloppy, but the playing field needs to be level. Anyone who's listened to more than 5 minutes of his speeches and has read/listened to his stance against pedophillia knows what he's about. I'm fact, I'm not even trying to make the playing field level, I'm trying to weaponize us all to kill their arguments dead.
Deleted the post. Thank you all for coming in and saying this. There's a post which is higher rated than mine  (didn't see it before I posted), if they haven't been notified alresdy, they need to pull the post too
Is there a similar thread for people who've met Hillary? This post has whet my appetite.
Finally I have a legitimate excuse.
The joke was from /u/ldanwill. By the time I'd made the picture your post disappeared. Credit to that man/woman - just wanted to add to it!
That's true actually. She did say she wanted him to return to the US to face it all and put it to bed. But at the same time in the same article said "he probably wouldn't do it again if he had the choice." \n\nWe shouldn't bypass the fact this was anal rape as well. Pretty savage. If I'd anal raped a 13 year old after drugging her and was exiled from a country because of that, I would also say "That was a bad life decision." She's very close to defending him. Maybe not explicitly, but it's on the cusp.
I've just given you the definitions. When put in context with the other words in the title, it's clear you're either incredibly stupid or just want an argument. I'm leaning towards the latter - but I'm sure any subsequent responses from you will be trying to change my mind over to the former.
I'm just a humble Russian bot. Any intelligence I have is artifical.
Tanks 4 da Guld kang stranggger fraaand!!!
It's got nothing to do with Trump in the sense that this post is not about what Trump has done. It's about what Takei did today. \n\nThere's plenty of threads about what Trump's done. People like Takei or JK Rowling can do and say really ridiculous childish shit without the counter argument of "yeh but Trump!" being interjected at every opportunity on topics calling them out on their acts of petulance. \n\nThe only way Trump is relevant to this story is that he was being targeted by bitter Takei once again. The man is obsessed, he's unable to post about any other subject. A sad way to go out, I'm sure we can all agree.
Just an unfortunate coincidence. I'm looking at a bunch of synonyms for cuck and two of them appear [here](http://imgur.com/21jGMVa) on the list.\n\nLooking at that list, there's a couple more that could be considered offensive when put into a different context. Pansy. Mommas Boy. Sissy. Daisy. These are all legitimate synonyms listed by thesaurus.com - so with that in mind, what now? Ban all of these words? Riot in the streets? Pay reparations? \n\nThankfully, the majority of people saw the title and didn't get triggered. It's no surprise that all the angry liberals started pounding my inbox once it hit /r/all - they'd find a way to have an argument if they were the only ones in the room - but it's very obvious that the context of my title was insinuating Takei is a coward. \n\nAnd yes I was being over the top with the terminology and the way it was written. It's much funnier that way.\n\n
He's only gone and deleted it!!
This infographic/list will be have the sole purpose of defending Milo
I need an answer on this too. Why would someone lie about this? A bit strange how all of those articles have been removed from Salon at this convenient time.
Circle jerk time guys.
A British DJ, which I'm sure you will agree means he's well qualified to speak confidently and factually about medieval death tolls.
Me neither now. Strange.
Who was the director of X-Men who was embroiled in this business as well? Not actually sure if he was a director, but was certainly associated with the movie in some capacity.
This was my first but I'm certainly going to make more in the next day or so. Judging by the responses, compilations do seem to be pretty high powered red pill weapons against liberals in the Great Meme War. I'll tag you in the next one!
That's the important part about this - he fucking **drugged** her!
Fuck
[Satan confirmed](http://i.imgur.com/1LrLy9D.jpg)\n\nSearch for the video on youtube. He's sweating his schlong off just talking about it.
Mine was far better. Your message had absolutely zero point to it. Care to try again, junior?
Any links you could send over? I haven't heard of this one either unfortunately. 
Yep nice one. I'd never heard of Salon or Todd Whathisname before all that crazy shit emerged yesterday - are they anything major? 
Might be a stretch, but do you have a source on the 100 people who rallied behind him? A list of names would be ideal.
I've got a spicy photo of him hanging out with Epstein. Thanks for reminding me.
*"The United States Senate Select Committee on Intelligence (sometimes referred to as the Intelligence Committee or SSCI) is dedicated to overseeing the United States Intelligence Community—the agencies and bureaus of the federal government of the United States who provide information and analysis for leaders of the executive and legislative branches."*\n\nWidely regarded as the deep state or 'shadow government'. \n\n[More in depth explanation here](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate_Select_Committee_on_Intelligence)
But has since defended him also. Very strange situation. 
Is there a source on that? It'd hurt me to know that about Charlie but I won't be a liberal about this.
[Not safe for work or life](http://m.imgur.com/ojEmx4p?r)
Connected to Paul Bonacci and Johnny Gosch, if I remember correctly?
Yep that's Sulu rubbing a man's schlong uninvited. It's ok though because he's a liberal, so no need to call the police.

Highjacking top comment for visibility:\n\nLooks like the failing NYT deleted the tweet. Someone has likely been taken to the wood shed!\n\nI can still see it via the Twitter app, but if anyone can't then you can see an archived version [here at archive.org](https://web.archive.org/web/20170217191006/https://twitter.com/nytimes/status/832649572795170816?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) and [here at archive.is](http://archive.is/LBeyM)\n\nCredit to /r/BernillaryClanders and /r/minimim for their nimble archive based special moves.
[But JK Rowling told me that all that happened in Sweden - the biggest news story in the whole country - was a horse getting rescued from a well.](https://twitter.com/jk_rowling/status/833267685467234306)\n\nAre you saying she's an ill-informed liberal using her vast audience to push a narrative, you fucking white male privileged bigot nazi misogynist Russian bot?
In to the dossier you go, Whoopi.
What?
I already hate Family Guy so I haven't seen this - do you have any examples/links? I seriously wouldn't know the first place to look.\n\nI think this would come under the Silverman category of where it's 'joking', but still important for the double standard.
Thought about this earlier. Only unfortunate issue is there are no names listed. Difficult one to substantiate, despite it being blindly obviously true.
[You are fake news](http://i.imgur.com/GItxAev.jpg)
He served 11 months I think. Seems light.
If true, it must have dropped insanely because this screenshot was from very soon after it was deleted. 15 mins prior it was the same score.\n\nEither way, we win again! **Still not tired!**
Yeh I think you're right there - good point. I think I'll only use the ones which are explicitly and obviously bad in future - lord knows there's plenty out there and then there can be no mistakes. Thanks for flagging pede. It's my first one, almost got it right!
Wait, what? Racist name calling? Explain the charges brought against me.
Saw this earlier. Probably the most cast iron example I've seen thus far.
> and they eat their own *shit*\n\n
I hear your point but it's not concrete enough. Can't be any ambiguity in the examples.
This post was more about highlighting how if a conservative, or more specifically my example of President Trump, had tweeted something like this out it would have been met with a fierce backlash and screenshots would be plastered all over the MSM until Monday morning.\n\nJust highlighting the hypocrisy, and we should remember this tweet next time Trump is attacked for speaking out on uncomfortable facts.
I love the fact so many purple haired triggered liberals are seeing their narrative crash and burn, in similar fashion to their own unsuccessful lives and miserable bank accounts, and the only way they can feel empowered is downvoting **TRUTH**.\n\nFuck all of you cunts. We're not even one month in, get used to this feeling and prepare for much worse!
She's not said a word about refugees since she was called out. I doubt she's changed her stance, but she's certainly shut the fuck up a bit. Having said that, she's doubled down on anti-Trump rhetoric in place of it.
Haha I'll be sure to, fellow 'pede
Perfect. \n\n# Kurt, you just made the list.
Saw this earlier. It's absurd he feels the need to defend this bullshit, but as he said, some accusations are so heinous you need to.
Again that's fair - thanks for being reasonable. Getting a lot of heat over this at the moment despite me explaining lol :-)
Don Lemon ramming a tequila down his throat and enthusiastically threatening to pierce his nipples summarizes CNN's integrity quite fittingly.
Ponce means someone who avoids taking responsibility for themselves where I'm from.\n\nI'm getting a lot of hate on here for the misinterpreted words. Guessing we're getting brigaded by liberals.
Truly a man of many monikers.
Don Lemon announcing my death is the worst way I can imagine to go.
He didn't even make it far into the show. SAD!
Media was on somewhere around 20% when it started getting noticed about 7000 votes in. Was just a very obvious attempt to use his 2.1 million, mostly liberal, followers to make Trump look bad.\n\nAside from winning by default because he raged-quit, the win is from taking it from 20% to practically level. Over 10 hours left on the poll and the momentum was clearly in our favor. George knew it was time to fall on his own sword.
Is there a TL;DR on this? I'm working at high energy right now and 55 minutes is too long. Can watch tonight but a summary would be ideal
I wasn't being racist - check my post history to see the definition of yellow belly. Honestly I'm shocked I'm even having to say this, but whatever.\n\nSpez: In fact here it is for you http://i.imgur.com/yp3VmZ9.jpg\n\nYou're absolutely right, we shouldn't stoop to the levels of liberals- we shouldn't automatically assume everything is racist.
No problem at all - it's going to happen when there's so many of us from across the world with different native tongues and regional meanings of words!
I wasn't being racist - check my post history to see the definition of yellow belly. Honestly I'm shocked I'm even having to say this, but whatever. 
It's all the same to Gary
That's fair, but I've explained the meaning and I'm telling you I'm not so (unless you're a liberal looking for an argument, which you won't get) maybe you can settle that I'm not and we can move on?
I've personally never been the same since viewing 'the incident'. As patriots, it is important we see these things to understand the enemy and protect the vulnerable. Thank you for your service.
Do you have any links at all?
Good shout on all accounts there. Plenty of material to use. If I'm found with 2 bullets in the back of my head and it's a suicide, you know why.
Todd Nickerson just made the fucking list.
Not sure why this is getting downvoted so heavily? The previous reply was "ur a shill" - that's not how debate or investigative conclusions work. Yes it's a case if taking this guy for his word (unless they provide proof of their correspondence) but coming back with an ad hominum attack is far more retarded.\n\nI'm keeping an open mind on both ends of this, seen compelling arguments for both sides so far.
Drink it in, maaaan!
I'll certainly watch this tonight, but I'm looking for things which are easily digestible to grab the short attention spans of liberals. Is there a summary on it?
We have the best web designers, don't we folks?
Oh how could I forget about Creepy Joe! The only other exception aside from Sessions was James Lankford. He alpha's Biden throughout.
I did check it wasn't satire first. It wasn't.\n\nMixed emotions. Happy I could include it in the delightful pictorial, sad because vintage liberal behavior.
Have you any sources on Eichenwald and Kaine?
Great stuff. Saw the video but was hoping for an article. Thanks!
It's been the second highest rated post on the sub for the last few hours, it got serious attention. To say otherwise wouldn't be neccassarily factual. \n\nIn regards to whether Trump is a cream-puff, I don't believe he is but perhaps you do. Takei put out a poll and revoked it once he realized it was going to backfire and destroy his narrative. I mean, that's childish isn't it. I'm not saying Trump is perfect, but this isn't about Trump's behavior. \n\nWho would have you preferred over Trump as president? 
Fully agree. If you have any names please do send them over. Journalists are just as important in this.
I hear you - but I've seen a lot of people say they've lost respect for him over this. Incidents of liberal hypocrisy (re: JK Rowling, Pewdiegate, Jeremy whatshisname cancelling because of Milo - other recent notable cases) do red pill those in the middle.\n\nAlso I'm quite enjoying the shitposting.
I'm on the fence with this one too. To not condemn Milo's comedy but condemn McFarlane's would only be detrimental. Will give it some thought though
Mutual consent is implied. 
so on that note do you like the idea of the CBC promoting a viewpoint that is ultimately self destructive to society?
the fact that they support undocumented (read: illegal) labour is enough for me to never go there.\n\nbut its not like I went there in the first place - im not a pretentious university student
indeed  - the more people who see the CBC for what it is the faster it will be defunded.
then the person who is being, as you put it, judged based on his race alone belongs to an organization that itself demonstrates racism, I would think that trump (or anyone in a similar position) would demand a recusal.\n\nCase in point:  if this person were a jury member and not a judge he would be removed by the defendant during the selection process immediately.\n\n
im not denying IQ or its value.  im simply asking it 184 is feasable from anyone, let alone an actor.  dont get me wrong I love james woods but this puts him above everyone on the planet afaik
She and soros should be immediately arrested for sedition.
something something nigel farage.  Gotta watch that double edged sword
I wonder if Milo intentionally went in there dressed as a SJW
18 million percent is a lot. she must have not been that great before
trump has proven that people are more powerful than money.  Hes proving it again.  Let soros blow a bunch of cash that only gives trump a reason to have him arrested
the series would have ended better if jadzia waited just one more season
Excuse me, did you just assume my height?
most pedes would have committed to the act and showed us instead of whored for internet points.  just saying
goddamnit our country needs help bad
A republic simply means that there is no king or other form of monarchy in control of the government.  its actually a much more loose term than democracy, which means rule of the people, which means not only is there no king but there is also a vote wherein the population makes the major decisions.\n\nFor purposes of the US - the US is not a democracy.  It's technically a constitutional republic.  that is to say how government runs is determined by physical contract (the constitution and associated documents) and does not have a leader that is royalty.
public hot tub.  no one there, but the water isnt exactly clean
seriously 4 years?\n\ncould it be that the left genuinely thinks they have such a massive majority population on their side that such a stupid ideas as this would have worked?  He had to know it was going to be trolled
he's an elected official.  aside from him losing an election im not sure we can remove him anymore than we can remove soros from our history\n
Im not gonna waste my time on a conversation with someone who gets personally aggressive about something they know little about.  I hope your downvoting me makes you feel better at least.
ok lets look at the debt claim you made.  the link below is a simple google search.  feel free to pick any result you choose:\n\nhttps://www.google.ca/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#q=us+debt+from+2008+to+2016\n\nTell me more about how he dropped debt by 1T.  Do you have a source or did you just make it up ?
ok seriously. is 184 even possible?  yeah, especially not an actor.  dont get me wrong I love James Woods but lets be realistic\n\nhttps://classconnection.s3.amazonaws.com/713/flashcards/1314713/png/wechesler1331766743056.png
I agree wholeheartedly
my point is that the womens march was staged like so much arab spring, and americans are falling for it.  the protest would never have gotten that large or have happened at all were it not for money from this particular globalist.
and not just any refugee, but a 12 year old child.  I can tell by the beard
not a very efficient death camp if he's been to 8 of them
if the people calling in to the talk shows are any indication I would repsectfully disagree.
I think it would be more accurate to say he was the first person to make politics cool
Dont get me wrong - im not saying socialism doesn't work.  im saying it doesnt work when you inject massive numbers of people who wont pay into the system by way of taxes but still have access to that system.  \n\nsince the left seems to be OK with both (social services + mass refugees) the conclusion is that its an unsustainable system.
kinda ruins the whole point of the IQ number being relevant then, doesnt it?\n\n"my IQ is 155, but only on the IQ-V2 scale"
you fool!  procrastinators aren't productive!  You'll have no idea how to do it properly
ahh yes. takin the kids out for a good 'ol seal clubbing.  why I remember back in the day....
missed it - got a link?
Only sub im ever really on is the_donald.   I used to also go on /r/hillaryclinton but got repeatedly banned.  im shadowbanned from /r/politics but who isnt nowadays.\n\nVoat.co if you want actual information.  
im out too.  whats a good replacement for a canadian like me?
this would have had to have been around 1945 actually - in the 1940's germany was in command of the war and america wasnt even in it yet, having waited until dec 1941 to join in the war once pearl harbor happened
yup
jokes on you, thats a black bear. 
its funny - I love star trek and used to admire its vision of the socialist utopia....they had no money yet had everything.\n\nBut then you realize that the only way for this to work is for them to have unlimited clean energy and replicators...so in other words magic.\n\nIt just reinforces the notion that socialism in the form that everyone wants it is an impossibility.
this is probably my favorite picture of trump as a president. The island of stability amid the storm he inherited
I agree its important, but there seems to be a problem with a soros funded uprising that should be dealt with first
O'Reilly is still on the top?  damn i thought tucker overtook him 
\nThey do this all the time, figured I would just wait until the next time and blam! here it is:\n\nright now on radio one is a show with women all talking about the fear of trump and the loss of womens rights.  there is no countervailing viewpoint.  I will post the link once its done from the CBC website.\n
no. let them do their thing - more and more people are turning away from them just way watching their own actions.\n\nThen they go low, we go high.
a bus driver and cleaner typically doesnt make enough to pay taxes to the point where they pay for themselves, let alone others.  Even so, the employment among refugees is insanely low.  \n\nmy point still stands.  again - im speaking about refugees and not immigrants who typically have to demonstrate a working knowledge of the local language and an education in order to get into a country.
the position of Kennedy to me is a powerful statement - the assassinated president is only partially there but on the right (which is to say, left) side. \n\nAlso im suprised theres no nixon
yeah ok, fair enough.
guaranteed the refugees come with a sweet grants and other money - otherwise wheres the motivation
Im no fan of takei, but lets be honest with ourselves.  The_Donald prides itself on boycotting and brigading all the time.\n\nStarbucks, lumber stores, you name it.  if it hints of anti trump this sub of thousands will try to take it down.\n\nCase in point with regards to takei:\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/5uq8ks/lets_change_this_poll_from_liberal_pervert_george/\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/5uq4zh/calling_all_pedes_george_takeis_trying_to_stump/\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/5usgh6/centipedes_great_victory_with_george_takeiyou_got/\n\nWe're guilty of the exact same stuff sharia blue is, just in a different way.\n
jurors can be excluded for any reason the lawyers deem fit during the selection process. its called peremptory challenge.\n\nbut even before this stage the lawyers get a number of vetos where they can remove a juror for any reason, not have to state that reason, and cannot be challenged on it.\n\nHaving said that - \n\nHow would you feel if, for instance, you were considered famous among half of the nation for hating mexicans and the judge in a case you have to deal with was mexican himself?  be honest.\n\nIts not racist to ask for a guarantee that the judge wont be racist either.
It's the ultimate expression of living vicariously through another person
you can argue it down to a generation if you want - thats still 20 years of a refugee who needs money for healthcare, housing, food, clothing etc.  understanding and speaking the local language is by itself a feat and not even close to the amount of education needed to get a job that actual contributes to society by way of taxation that covers other people like what the natives are doing.\n\nthe math simply doesnt work
I drive a lot so I listen to the radio.  after a while top 40 gets boring and the other talk radio channel is unabashedly right wing.  I dont want to find myself in an echo chamber of my own design.  Besdies, all it does is reinforce the notion in my mind that they are not neutral and i've become so annoyed with it that Ive changed my views on the matter instead of not caring at all.\n\n\n\n
im just saying that the claim of honestly answering a question is false when there are calls to specifically skew the vote to one side.\n\n
I put rand paul in the same pocket as ted cruz - both legitimately wanted the type of world donald is creating, but neither had the balls to carry it out themselves and are finally coming around to the idea that its possible through trump.\n\nI wouldnt trust either of them though.
sadly they arent alone.\n\nhttps://pbs.twimg.com/media/CxL3s7JVQAE_ICN.jpg\n\nLet that second tweet sink in....
How much do you want to bet that Shia did this himself and it just using a scapegoat?\n\nThe project totally backfired on him, and to have that go on for a year would be just too damaging
thats what the police is for.  we love our law enforcement people, dont we?
indeed - cruz is taking it to him\n
only problem with having the democrats implode like this is that without a decent opposition its easy to any party to quicky go full retard.\n\nHaving said that holy shit I never thought I would see either party blow up and Ive been watching since reagan
im saying that supporting people in any form who by definition broke the law to arrive is fundamentally a bad thing.
im simply pointing out that your earlier phrase of "honestly answering a question you asked" is clearly false in the face of obvious influence towards a specific side.\n\nwhat really happened is we did to "them" what they do to "us" using the exact same weapon.  The battle continues
wait! it gets better!\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gzxN2JkvOnY\n\nSorry to ruin your day heh
hate to point this out but...we blame obama for this but give trump credit for the jobs report....what are we, liberals?\n
By using twitter like this he puts pressure on other public officials to do the same.  he knows not many people will watch the press reports. \n\nFucking ingenious 
then they staffed it with refugees
Mr. president, I...
I havent had a cable subscription for over a decade now - all of my news comes from the intertubes basically
Islam and Violence?  Get outta here....
the math applies to any country that has a partial or totally socialized system that allows others to access it freely, and has nothing to do with corruption.\n\nHeres an even simpler example:  your a father of 3 kids with a wife in a nice home.  \n\nYour food budget is 200$ per month.  \n\n6 months later, 2 men move into your house.  They will not or cannot work for at least a year and a half, but you have to give them food and board as you feel its the right thing to do.\n\nWhat do you think will happen to the quality / quantity of food for your family now that you have to feed 2 more people than you originally planned for? \n\n
The right thinks the left is uninformed and incorrect.\n\nThe left thinks the right is actually evil.\n\nNo one protested like this when Obama won.  
 what does it say about their culture if they're willing to go to jail instead of return to their country
I love blacks.  The problem is, I hate niggers.\n\nMuch in the same way I love women, but I hate SJWs.
agreed.  besides, bathrooms for deaf people dont even need background music so its cheaper
this was him vs. another person, not takei.\n\nhaving said that, takei and shatner never got along, not even during the actual taping of TOS (the original series)
ironically it was the left (specifically john stewart when he was with the daily show) to call this out first:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNV3_bS_0ts\n\nits a good example \n
if were going to go on facts, then trump won the electoral college and people are protesting a man who has only been in power for 6 days out of nothing but fear.  it will dissipate as a result, and its already starting to.
as if heterochromic isnt the reason you bought the cat in the first place
love the name - but what were the ratings like under obama for comparison?
no, but I remember posting it a day or so ago here on this sub

well, (using round numbers) lets say you have a population of 100 million people.  Math gets done and the government figures out that to take care of 100 million people it costs 500 million dollars.\n\nSo the government sets the tax at a rate that generates that amount of money to provide said health care.\n\nInject refugees (not to be confused with immigrants) who on average take 2 generations to get to a point where they can make enough money to not rely on government assistance and actualy pay taxes themselves and suddenly there is a problem.  Either we have to tax the existing base population more or the healthcare system will have to suffer.\n\nand thats just healthcare.  same goes for all assistance from food stamps to subsudized housing.
they rape our children in exchange for letting us make comics of their prophet?  \n\nISLAM IS RIPPING US OFF IN TRADE
With that, Canada goes one step closer to becoming the country the "immigrants" fled in the first place.\n\nIf the immigrants win and canada becomes islamic, where will they flee to next?  God knows it wont be canada.
learn the difference between deficit and debt before you go around telling people to "shut the fuck up".\n\nPeople like you who are barely smart enough to grasp these concepts are the most dangerous because of exactly this.

"so im at this protest trying to start a riot using the club I bought with my soros(tm) paycheck, and out of nowhere this MAGA freak sprays me with the stench of success.  I dropped everything and went and got a job.  Thanks Invaka!"
if you dont follow the news you end up just as confused as some of the people on this sub.  Like it or not its still the CBC.  However there is one more soul among the ranks of those who wish to see it defunded now because I spent so much time listening.\n\nBefore I was a supporter.
yeah im starting to see what you mean
Tonight on Alternate Timeline Television:  Republican Nominee Ted Cruz debates The Democrat's choice of Bernie Sanders.  Who has the better Argument to make for the american voter?\n
Soros is really going all out on this isn't he....Grass roots resistance doesn't have this level of organization

if you mean progress as in advanced a progressive agenda then you are correct.\n\nBut if you mean progress as in things headed in the right direction then I would argue the opposite.
His campaigns primary message is one that mexicans find offensive, and youre asking me why he would not want a mexican judge in court during said campaign?\n\nseriously?
depends how you look at it I guess.  I for one can't think of a right that men have that women dont in the US.  As for economy well, thats a whole other subject
imagine how scary it would be to have the same scale problem as an ant - life would be terrifying.  \n\n"in tonights news, new york was wiped off the map by 2 large giants using what appeared to be a magnifying glass"
The tolerant left everybody.  Perfect example right here.\n\n
For me it was the realization that immigration + social policies like free healthcare simply cannot work from an economic perspective.  The more I looked into the left the more I realize it was all just words and promises with no concrete explanations as to *how*.
im trying to break it down to a level you can understand, since you seemed to think that corruption was the reason socialism doesnt work in the US.\n\nIts easy to fall for the moral argument of doing the right thing, but at the end of the day the doctor has to be paid, and the taxpayer can only pay for so many people.  Thats the failing of the "left"  if were going to stay on topic.\n\nMaybe this video will explain it better than I can:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAQvTFnNNGQ\n\nEDIT: apologies if my first sentence came off as condescending

Too late for debate? Sounds good to me.
I'm on the other side of the argument and I'm seeing it too.
I'll try and explain the joke for you.\n\n2.3 adds multicrew. With that comes the gunner role, where you can control the turrets on a friends ship.\n\nThe joke is that 2.4 adds a station turret gunner role, but he's just sitting in a spot where the authorities can't fire at him while he is firing on other ships, effectively becoming a station turret.
Never, but I will definitely keep this in mind for the future. It could totally explain some of the other strange courses I've seen charted. 
I'll give it a try

You sound like Dan Carlin. 
Are you in Alberta right now? Calgary has an unemployment rate >10%. Edmonton is >9%. I got turned away from a grocery position at Save On Foods, a company I have more than a year of positive working experience with and a position I have three years of experience in. That has been my only call back so far. I was laid off at the end of November because the apartments I was maintenance for were sold by the owner, who lives in Arizona, because they were hemorhagging value. Rents were reduced to stay competitive with the market and bad eggs were able to move in, reducing the value even further. These are two high rises on Jasper Ave in downtown Edmonton that I've seen turn to shit holes. 200 units that my boss and I were responsible for, sold by the son of the man that designed them, because of this fucking economy. It breaks my heart, but I'm not putting myself on the cross for the sake of Canada. I need to look after myself and my interests, which happen to be in line with American interests right now.\n\nMaybe I can affect positive change before I leave, vote as often as I can before I have to move, but there's just no place for me here anymore.
That's just Old Iron Keep, dude. Especially if you're playing Scholar. Intercontinental ballistic samurai, like fuck... 
No, the Brown Dwarf Badja A is the system's primary star. I guess the trip planner doesn't take into account the system's primary star, just whether or not it has a KGBFOAM star or not. Just another example of my nav computer trying to get me killed!
Is it directly negatively affecting anyone else's play time?

Yeaaah they kinda fixed/nerfed that platform in Scholar. 
I have removed the post.
Players should be punished for using an in-game exploit in order to have a negative impact on other players games.
Yeah I figured that one out a little too late, you can see me disabling stuff in the video. 
Canada isn't as free as people like to think it is.
I may have to play around with my controller settings to make this work but it sounds like a great idea! Right now my bumpers will identify a hold as a press, do you know if there's a way to set it to differentiate between a hold and a press?
Mad Adder, love it! I also painted my DBS yellow, set up four MCs with yellow tracers, and lovingly refer to her as my Rumblebee.\n\nI'm finding the Asp X to be surprisingly capable in combat. Now that I have a larger power plant and faster recharging distributor, both G2, I'm going to swap out the two small gimballed pulses for beams and see how that treats me.\n\nSpeaking of surprisingly capable, I've been blown up more than a couple of times by Orcas. Killer whales, for sure.
Mostly out of efficiency. I discovered my Asp X could easily be outfitted for 26 tons of cargo and still take part in the war going on in Sothis and Ceos, and I didn't want to be flying back and forth very often. I actually got eight of my terminals shooting down Sirius Corp ships.
Over and over again. 
Yeah dude. Everyone is aware that there is a no fire zone around around stations. If they weren't aware, they wouldn't be looking for a sneaky place to shoot docking ships from.\n\nSo the only people that are going to be doing this will be doing this to shoot ships entering the mail slot. If they're firing at NPCs, okay that's fine. If they are firing at human players in order to achieve a negative impact on their experience, not okay that's not fine. If they do it regularly they are clearly a negative impact on the game as a whole and should be removed, like every other unintended bug.\n\nIf you can't understand how griefing players by using unintended bugs could be a bannable offense then we don't really have much else to talk about as far as this conversation is concerned.
Because that's how no fire zones work.
Are they using exploits to do it?
> and blind spots\n\nIt's a big galaxy. They're going to miss some things here and there.
Ah well it happens fairly often to me, and I rarely ever refresh the route plotting feature. Only when I'm mid trip and notice an unscoopable star is up next, as it's always set to KGBFOAM and to filter the route. 
Thank you, neighbour!

Yeah, that would work just fine. There are only two USB 3.0 ports on the front which some accessories require so I like to keep the ports free. Duracell makes a clip on battery attachment that can recharge in a cradle, that might be worth looking into.
I do. Here's the video of me gliding in to scoop at the star, timestamped to just before I figured out disabling modules decreases fuel usage. In particular, watch the Fuel/hr as I disable modules.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/Ml5NXdkp67k?t=37
I didn't get it. Thanks. 
If you're into combat the DBS is a lot of fun.
Soft cap on phases is 40, hard cap is 50. Those 19 points would be better spent on lore implications. 
Casters would shoot at you before they could render on your screen on 360. The few hanging around the temple across the bridge from Vendrick's gear would shoot you before you reached the few outside the second bonfire. The tracking was insane to the point that you couldn't roll forwards or backwards through the spell, only left or right to your death off a ledge. And then the gang bang with healers before the third bonfire? For-fucking-get about it! I'm willing to bet that most of the people that soloed Amana before the patch did so with a bow. I know I did.
As far as I can tell, he doesn't actually have a plan though? This is just a proposal to create a plan to address a growing problem.

The popular vote, if you will. 
Definitely check out Calle Mexico.\n\nDefinitely avoid pretty much everything else. In particular, the bed bug ridden furniture strewn alleys, the hooker on the corner of Waterloo Ford that will scream at any passerby (except me, I give her a cigarette from time to time but I can't protect you), the needles oh\nGod the needles...\n\nI'm mostly joking. Nearby is Nomiya for awesome authentic Japanese ramen, Happy Harbor Comics for comic books and geeky stuff, Saigon Taste has a great $10 bowl of pho or Marco's is next door if you want a donair. Railtown Park is a nice walk and the river valley isn't much farther away, 124st is pretty rad. I actually really like living downtown, even if my hood is a bit rough. \n\n
It's been Destiny and Elite Dangerous for me, I'm also excited to return. 
I like to collect and outfit ships for different purposes. Because of that my bank account hasn't been able to afford anything beyond the AspX and Vulture, but nearly everything leading up to those two. As it stands right now, I am less excited for multicrew compared to all the other features. Holo-Me adds yet another layer of customization for your CMDR without having to visit the Fdev store page. I'm extremely excited to start naming my fleet! I just really don't care about multicrew yet, although that may change when I test out the matchmaking.\n\nEther way, I'm extremely excited for 2.3 and the opportunity to move to PlayStation so I can play with my friend.
You should be thankful for people that defend free speech and honest discourse. If this Trump presidency is as bad as you think it is, you might need it in the future.
You misread. Thanks for the advice though. 
600m?! I'm in that awkward stage between AspX/Vulture and Python/FDL, and this looks my ticket to bigger and better. 
I'm replying under the assumption that you simply shared the video but did not upload it.\n\nYou are not at all in trouble. You did nothing wrong. This is not a strike against you. You are in good standing with the sub and Kimmundi, as far as I can tell.\n\nI do feel it is important for us as a community to respect the wishes of the creators of the game that we all love and rally around. If they don't want this video being distributed then I feel it is my obligation to do what I can as a moderator to assist in that. Whether or not you agree with me, or the sub agrees with me, is another issue altogether.\n\nFeel free to ask me any other questions or voice your concerns.
I enjoy giving them away though :).\n\nI can always be paid in beer, or candy.
Not really. DPM is handy for games where encounters take upwards of hours, like MMOs. DPS is better suited for games with low times to kill. Take Destiny's crucible as an example, although DPS isn't a huge factor in that game; your typical hand cannon has a DPS of about 215 without reloading, and your average guardian has 200 health. That's pretty easy to understand. It should take less than a second to kill a guardian under perfect circumstances.\n\nIn DPM that comes to 12903, a number that makes little sense in relation to the rest of the game, crucible specifically.\n\nNow I don't play proper MMOs (does Elite Dangerous count?) but as I understand it they have raid tier bosses and damage fluctuations based on part composition, buffs, etc..  When the boss has 666,000hp dealing 12903 DPM makes a little more sense.\n\nUnless we're talking deaths per minute, which I haven't seen around for a decade or so.

Oh it's on. Has this never happened to you? I'm always getting sent to TTS stars.
I figured that out on an empty tank just moments ago.
Breaking the law is an intended game mechanic. Griefing players through unintended bugs and blind spots is not.\n\nI agree that FD should fix this, obviously, but also that players should be held accountable for their bad behavior.

From the description;\n\n\nOur next guest is in the early stages of putting together a report called "Reclaiming Alberta’s Future Today," or RAFT. It proposes to put tens of thousands of people back to work cleaning up as much as $100 billion worth of liabilities in Alberta’s oil patch — everything from leaking inactive wells to abandoned pipelines. We hear from Brent Nimeck, a former oil services worker.\n\nSo essentially, Make Alberta Great Again.

> talk about anything unrelated to Dark Souls\n\n*twirls banhammer*\n\nJust kidding, welcome to the community!\n\nAs a PS4 owner I would say your best bet would be to play Bloodborne > 2 > 3. I say this because Bloodborne was specifically designed to fuck with Souls players in the way that combat is designed. Souls is slow, methodical, defensive. Bloodborne is fast, frenetic, insanely aggressive. This skills you learn in Bloodborne will help you in 2 and 3. The skills you learn in 2 and 3 will hurt you in Bloodborne.\n\nIt's also exclusive to the PS4 and widely regarded as one of the best games on the system. Personally, it's my favorite Souls game of the bunch.
Buy two controllers and a charging dock for both.
No, I'm advocating that players be held accountable for their in game actions in accordance with the legally binding document we all agreed upon. 
Blue is still a smelter demon. You even get the same soul. And the cats have their own separate souls. I'm not really sure what you're trying to say. That we'll get another version of Prince Lothric?

I do.
I warned /u/abyss__watchers that [the sub](https://i.gyazo.com/ba65c195b226dca19e118e300848c57e.png)  would eventually revolt. 
That's exactly what I'm talking about. Hell even raids in Destiny can take hours. 
I don't know what any of that means. I just wanna get paid and help the environment.
I don't follow. Smelter demon was a failed attempt at creating a dragon. The cats are cats. Where does Lothric come in here?

Don't worry about it. Getting the video off of the internet (lol gl) is not your responsibility or mine. That is for Bamco and their legal team to deal with.
Hah well to my credit, I earned my wings with exploration. It wasn't until I was completely comfortable piloting my ships that I started to dabble in combat. There's a reason the Asp X is my daily driver, and it's only just this past weekend that I sidegraded her from a stripped down speed machine to something a bit more multipurpose.\n\nI don't even really have a play style, and you can tell from my fleet. I have a Cobra for mining and smuggling, a Viper for bounty hunting, a DBS for stealth combat, Asp X for exploration and passengers, Vulture for combat CGs, a chrome hauler for ratting... The list goes on. I love the variety of Elite.\n\nNice shot with the probe by the way! It's odd that we were both hyperdicted tonight though... 
This is such a great idea and I would jump on the opportunity for both cash and moral reasons.

That's actually referring to a clause that if Bungie can't produce Destiny 2 in time that they well lose shares of their company to Activision.\n\n“If Bungie misses this year for Destiny 2, Activision is awarded a hefty chunk of the independent studio’s stock, according to two sources familiar with goings-on at Bungie,” he said. “Bungie employees’ stock vesting schedule is also based on game releases, including Destiny 2, which gives them major incentives to get the sequel out this year.”\n\nhttp://www.forbes.com/sites/insertcoin/2017/02/10/destiny-2-is-coming-out-this-year-or-else/\n\nSo we're likely to get a rushed final product, but without all the drama of the original's development.

We would all like this to not be a partisan issue, but the Democratic party has made this Democrat vs. Republican.  **If you vote Democrat in 2016, you are voting for their party platform**:\n\n>With 33,000 Americans dying every year, Democrats believe that we must finally take sensible action to address gun violence. While gun ownership is part of the fabric of many communities, too many families in America have suffered from gun violence. We can respect the rights of responsible gun owners while keeping our communities safe. We will expand background checks and close dangerous loopholes in our current laws, hold irresponsible dealers and manufacturers accountable, keep weapons of war—such as assault weapons—off our streets, and ensure guns do not fall into the hands of terrorists, domestic abusers, other violent criminals, and those with severe mental health issues.\n\nThe NRA didn't write that to trick people into sending them money.  The Republican party didn't write that to scare pro-gun voters to vote for them.  This is the heart & soul of the Democrat party.  This is their core values, and will be used to set the agenda if/when they win the election.\n\nIf you are able to convince yourself that you need to vote Democrat because you don't like the Republican party platform on other issues, that's fine--whatever.  But don't tell me gun control is not Democrat vs. Republican.  The Democratic party chose to make it that way.
Your honor, members of the jury, my client did not intend to kill anyone that night.  As we all know, without intent, their can be no prosecution.\n\nThanks Hillary!\n\n
The plaintiffs should be forced to put $250K in escrow to cover the defense fees when they get the case tossed before they allow it to proceed.  None of this after the fact, "Well, we can't & won't pay that." baloney.\n\nDid Lucky Gunner ever actually get their money from the Brady lawsuit?
That's actually pretty good for Hillary. ~~/s~~

Similar experience.  Went to CMU and some of my best friends are Pittsburgh fans.  \n\nThey were hurt when the Browns left.  It took away one of the things that made our friendship special.  When the Browns came back, the guy sitting next to me in CBS on 9/12/99 was one of them.  I was mercilessly & relentlessly mocked for 60 minutes.  And I wouldn't have had it any other way.\n\nThe first two people to text me 'Congrats' after the Cavs won?  Yep, those same Pittsburgh fans.\n\nBeen to many games at 3 Rivers/Heinz wearing my colors.  Never had a problem other than the occasional Steeler fan revealing their genitals.

>Additionally, the Fifth Amendment right of due process is only a constraint on the government, not the private citizen.\n\nSo if anything, this line of argument means police and other government officials (ATF, FBI, etc.) would not be permitted to use firearms/lethal force.

You can turn that off, as well as asking them to remove you from receiving solicitations if you do not wish to receive those either.
Filibuster away.\n\nIn the meantime, Trump can order his new Treasury Secretary to re-open the NFA registry to new machine guns under the 90-day amnesty as provided in section 207(d) of the 1968 Gun Control Act.\n\nThey want to play games?  How about 90 days to Form 1 all the things.  I'll raid my 401k for that party.

My current T7 guild has a leader that can't follow raid rules.  Since we cannot kick him, I am shopping for a new guild along with a friend.  (To be clear, we need 2 spots)\n\nWe both have very strong rosters as we've been playing since November. (30+ 7*'s, almost always top 20 in arena, finish 1-2 in raid)\n\nWe are looking for a T7 guild that raids with fair rules for all, and has a daily activity reset time between 9AM-4PM Eastern Daylight Time (1PM & 8PM GMT, I believe)\n\nAlly codes 952-558-574 & 131-186-896\n\nWe are still in the crappy guild, PM me here if you have a spot for us.  Thank you!
You are darn right. \n\nIn a just world, Candy Crowley & Lester Holt would lose their jobs and journalism credentials over a move like this.  \n\nThere is no way they can retract calling one of the candidates wrong in a forum like this.  Millions of people right now believe Trump doesn't know the law/Constitution when the opposite is true.
To be fair to MDA, there were a lot of guns nearby.  And they are extremely afraid of inanimate pieces of metal & plastic.\n\nI commented to my friend as we walked the NRA exhibition hall Friday, "You know, walking around here, I feel comfortable and at peace.  If you took some of those anti-gun types and dropped them in the middle of the Glock booth, they might literally die from anaphylactic shock before they could find their way out."
You are right.

You don't even need to go back to the founding fathers.  The militia is defined by law!\n\n[10 U.S. Code § 311 - Militia: composition and classes](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/10/311)\n\nThe militia of the United States consists of all able-bodied males at least 17 years of age and, except as provided in section 313 of title 32, under 45 years of age who are, or who have made a declaration of intention to become, citizens of the United States and of female citizens of the United States who are members of the National Guard.\n\nMost states also have similar, if not more inclusive, guidelines for membership in state militias.

Listen, I want to like Gary Johnson, I really do.  Cruz is my guy, and I think Trump is a giant question mark on just about every conservative principle.\n\nThat said, I'm not so sure that Gary Johnson is even as pro-gun as he portrays himself to be.\n\n* He does not own a gun, red flag.  Big red flag.\n\n* He does not seem well-versed on the pro-gun argument from interviews I've seen/read (no link, going from memory).  Seems to default to gun control is bad because "It's a right" rather than engage propaganda with truth.\n\n* Picked Bill Weld, a known graboid, for VP!?\n\n* From the [CNN town hall](http://www.cnn.com/videos/politics/2016/06/23/libertarian-town-hall-johnson-gun-control-restrictions-sot-3.cnn) on gun control laws: "We're not looking to roll back anything" & "We should be open to these discussions"\n\nSo, Hard Pass.  \n\nFor me, it's either hold my nose and vote Trump or skip President on the ballot altogether.  At least Trump seems willing to talk the talk.
> I found her stand-up pretty funny when I first heard it\n\nMe too, but the jokes were told by a different comedian the first time I heard it. 
True, but no one even seemed to care.  Duke, Hue, anyone.  It was just kinda like, "What?  Redskins ball!?  Well, I have the ball right here, but okay--you're the ref!"\n\nIf I were the coach on a bad call like that, I'd be writing a big check to Goodell to pay off my fine and begging him lower my suspension down to a couple games.

Per my other comment about those states where people can use their CHL to bypass NICS, the firearm enthusiasts/collectors that are buying THE MOST guns, are very likely not even included in the FBI NICS numbers.\n\nI know my purchases are not. ;)

>why are rape and murder illegal ? there still are murders and rapes? then let's make them legal???\n\nThe dipshit has it backwards.  The *crime* part is illegal (you know, the actual thing that harms another person.)\n\nThe proper analogy to "banning guns to stop gun violence" would be "banning penises to stop rape".
>FBI background check numbers, which roughly equate gun sales, totaled some 27,538,673\n\nNot really.  Many states now can skip the NICS background check if the purchaser has a concealed handgun license ( I think this is at least 20+ states)\n\nFurther, 1 BGC can be >= 1 firearm.\n\nThe disclaimer on the FBI-published NICS numbers is as follows:\n>These statistics represent the number of firearm background checks initiated through the NICS. They do not represent the number of firearms sold. Based on varying state laws and purchase scenarios, a one-to-one correlation cannot be made between a firearm background check and a firearm sale.
Preston Smith (Redskins #94) has has to be the most confused person on the field.  He watches Duke get up with the ball, looks back at the pile, back at the ball, back at the pile...
When you are the victor, it's not a march, it's a parade.
Problem is that a couple years from now, they will keep the "no-fly, no-buy" law on the books and start calling any NFA relief given back to us a "loophole" that needs to be closed.\n\nWe cannot keep compromising our rights away.

I'd love for Trump to use that exact wording in the debate.
They don't give 2 shits about the Bill of Rights, you think FOPA is gonna stop them?
More projection. \n\nRemember, if they think YOU would use a gun to stifle THEIR speech and cause them to passively acquiesce, it is only because they know in their heart, THEY would do the same to YOU.
Correct me if I'm wrong, but I believe the stats screen has changed with the mod patch.  \n\nIt used to be "100(20)" meant your effective stat was 120 (100 + 20 from gear)\n\nNow it is "120(20)" which means your effective stat is 120, with 20 coming from MODS.\n
They literally only see people for their color, gender, etc.\n
To be fair, that was Hillary's public position, her private position is going to be different.  America knew going in that she holds contrasting public & private opinions.
I'm sure the FBi was full-on investigating the reports from Disney & the gun store that reported him as suspicious.\n\nThat is to say, Loretta Lynch was investigating Disney & the gun store for hateful rhetoric & discrimination against a Muslim man.

This is to be expected, as Gun Control is a major part of the Democratic Party Platform.  When the entire party is anti-gun, you will get things like 100% Republican endorsements.
Tack the Hearing Protection Act on to every bill they try to pass as an amendment.\n\nJust to ensure any bullshit that gets past the House & Senate dies to Obama's veto pen.\n\n\n\n
Well, the Senate in 2014 had a Democrat majority when all the Sandy Hook bills came up for a vote, with Harry Reid as leader.\n\nThat was part of the "backs against the wall" mentality of the progun side.  That and the Democrats were coming after EVERYTHING-UBC, AWB, mag capacity. \n\nI think the lethargy this round can be attributed to a little too much trust in Mitch McConnell and the Republican majority to kill the bills this time.  Fact is, they might see this as a chance to buy into the whole "no fly-no buy secret list" baloney, which they can then use to expand government surveillance and extralegal prosecution.\n
Dang, thought I was just in a rut.  I probably bought 6-8, but it's been awhile since the last time.
So, the Hunter was named GeorgeSoros?
While others have covered it.  I'd add that the NFA is just a tax collection scheme.  Possessing an unregistered machine gun is basically tax evasion (at the federal level, anyway).\n\nThe 1968 Gun Control Act re-wrote Chapter 53 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, which deals directly with firearms.  \n\nIn section 207(d), the law states:\n>(d) The Secretary of the Treasury, after publication in the Federal Register of his intention to do so, is authorized to establish such periods of amnesty, not to exceed ninety days in the case of any single period, and immunity from liability during any such period, as the Secretary determines will contribute to the purposes of this title. \n\nAs far as I know, the amnesty provision has not been revoked by an ensuing law.\n
Building characters/teams is fun.  The actual gameplay?  Not so much.\nArena used to be fun, but after you've seen it hundreds of times, you realize it is just extremely elaborate coin flipping.\n\nNeeds head-to-head synchronous play to reach the next level.
I kind of feel bad that my own purchases no longer count towards the NICS numbers...\n\n(Ohio CHL holders can bypass NICS as of May 2016.)
Criminalization of the illusion of a threat to safety (wearing an empty holster) vs. the facilitation of an actual threat to safety (adult men allowed into women's restrooms/locker rooms).  \n\nThis is a poltiical subreddit and giving tips to point out the stupidity of opposing views is absolutely on topic.

>For one, you can buy a firearm in a state other than the one you live in without processing through an FFL in your home state, but those states have to border.\n\nI'm almost positive you are wrong.

Miller didn't even rule that we couldn't have them (SBS), just that the government is allowed to tax them.
But a man wearing a dress going into the little girls' room should be cheered & celebrated.

Halfway in, I told my wife, "This isn't helping him.  It shows him being all buddy-buddy & having fun with all these elitists."  My wife lost interest and left the room.\n\nThen he flipped the switch.  After a couple minutes, I hit pause on the DVR and went to get the wife so she could witness the public execution.\n\nHillary got some shots in, but you could tell he was loving every minute of it.  Giant set of balls on that guy.
I'm going to have to defer to Chelsea here--If anyone is an expert on rape law in Arkansas, it's the Clinton family.
The angle of the pile won't show a clear recovery because the ball was not in the pile.\n\nWatch the angle that shows Duke standing up, ball in his hand, raising it high to show everyone that he still had it.
Ah, but in order to regulate something which "shall not be infringed", repeal must occur.
And in greater numbers.
Where does the Sea Cow go then?\n\nI'm not even kidding...

Yep, the CDC did a research study in 2013, here it is-\n[PRIORITIES FOR RESEARCH TO REDUCE THE THREAT OF FIREARM-RELATED VIOLENCE](http://www.nap.edu/read/18319/chapter/1#v)\n\nRight there, on page ii-\n>This project was supported by awards between the National Academy of Sciences and both the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) (#200-2011-38807) and the CDC Foundation \n\nThey are not banned from research in the slightest.  They are only banned from advocacy.  You don't hear about this study very much, because the results did not exactly match the Obama Administration's hopes.  It basically showed gun control does little to nothing and guns are extremely useful for self-defense.\n\nSo, there is proof that the Dickey Amendment does not stop legitimate research funding by DHS/CDC.  How the graboids are allowed to twist that into "The evil NRA won't even let us study gun violence!" is a mockery of the truth.
Perfect, tack it on to no fly-no buy.  Let him veto and explain why he wants to destroy every hunters'* hearing and let terrorists buy guns at the same time.\n\n*-Yes, I realize this isn't just hunters.  But every "common sense" law they provide tells us how it won't hurt hunters.

Riiiiiighhhhht I'm the one who didn't answer the question. So again, Where is Eric Braverman? 
Don't let your memes be dreams\n\n#justdoit
Where's Eric Braverman?
Barbaric is the right word for it 
I had a post earlier today that went from 150 to 90 
#AND
Ok.  So when was the last time he was seen in public? 
I thought not.  It's not a story the Liberals will tell you. 
OOHH SHIITTT
Fuck yeah thank you 
Try putting walnut sauce on it 
Is this the end of Donald trump? 
WE WILL ERADICATE RADICAL. ISLAMIC. TERRORISM. FROM THE FACE OF THE EARTH

I'm going so sacrifice a chicken to moloch in my backyard, can I be a liberal now? \n\nSpez: to\n\nToo many Jager celebrating MAGA 2017
You were there Tuesday night at underground arts?? Dude as soon as Elvis flaming star starts playing a huge shoving match/brawl breaks out in front of me it was ridiculous. But they fucking killed it easily one of my favorite bands now
Mental gymnastics.  I love it, I picture the hurdles and the hoops of fire liberals have to jump through in their own heads to come to the conclusions they do,  then I picture them panting and catching their breathe as they yell racist! Sexist! 
Brilliant 
This pains me
I agree, this is getting bad.  Regardless of how much we don't want this to happen, we may soon have no choice 
Yeah what the fuck was that? There was singing coming from the speakers yet all she was doing was talking... embarrassing

The only thing I will give you is that government offices are usually only open during business hours. That is inconvenient for everybody. Other than that most of those items I mentioned are navigable for someone who wants to put a little effort in. Heck half of those apply to me and here I am with all sorts of government ids. The idea that voter id can be no-effort is impossible - and there in lies the liberal defense.  
Just become a coffee person
>So when you're so angry and seeing red that you just repeat what someone has said and then angrily pose a strawman you come off sounding stupid.\n\nTake a breath man. Don't be so defensive. You have people genuinely interested in your post, which was well written and has lots of great information. \n\nWhen you insult the people who ask polite, legitimate questions, you hurt your cause. People who might start evangelizing your position are turned off and walk away. \n\nYou outlined the Singapore system where saving is compulsory, but only hinted that what the US should consider is incentivized saving, not compulsory. It is understandable that people will question that. \n\nNow, with that said, as someone who worked in payroll outsourcing, incentivized saving still has a low adoption rate in vehicles like 401k where there is company matching. That's free money left on the table. Most adults will not carve their budgets to save for things that are in their best interests. I actually think compulsory HSA saving is a really good idea. I also think that everyone gets one when they are born as well.  \n\nAnd family pooling? Such a great idea. Not only does it compound the power when something terrible happens, but it is positive pressure to hold a family structure together AND positive pressure to raise children well so that there is a wider set of contributors that can support the family.

At least here in NY, you can get in trouble for this. If you do something that logically would cause harm, even if a criminal "walks right into it" you can be prosecuted. Real world example, setting boobytraps on your property. Even though someone is trespassing, because I know that my trap would cause bodily harm, I'm liable. It's kind of fucked up.  \n\nWith that said - I would love to see someone grab this hat. 
I actually think the administration will be in favor of this - but first things first right? Get the criminals out. Build the wall. Then we can have a conversation about the good ones. 
What are you talking about?!???!? Iranian islam is so progressive. They were even stoned!\nREEEEEEEEEEE. 
Well, I agree with you. But I don't think failing schools should get more money - or even the same money. They should be replaced. \n\nThe problem with what you stated above - which is how it works today - is that students are trapped and the schools have no way of improving. We agree. \n\nBut if students could be mobile - and take their funding with them, shittier schools would have reduced budgets and require cuts - cuts of shitty administrators and teachers - hopefully leaving the school smaller and leaner and better aligned to provide education to the remaining students. \n\nNow that too is impossible right now, even if we could make students mobile. Principals do not have the necessary power to drop dead weight. In order to actually have reduced funding actually work (instead of whatever it's doing today), we would need: student/fund mobility and the ability of principals to run schools like businesses. \n\nIf I were a principal, I would want to fire a teacher for any reason I wanted. I would want to hire only the teachers I wanted - and be held COMPLETELY accountable for the work they do and the success they bring. I would want the parents who send their children to me to be a hostile corporate board who can vote me out if I don't perform. Basically the way a business is run where I need to produce something for my customers or they vote with their feet. 
I'm pretty sure Poo told Piglet we're burning this bitch to the ground. 
Well played sir. 
What I don't get is that you are describing a perpetual motion machine (which is impossible, at least in physics). You have corporations fully automated, but if no one has money to pay for their goods the corps fold, so the corps pay money that is handed to people to use to buy stuff without adding to the economy. There is no such things as a completely closed system, energy leaks out. How is this utopia of basic income any different?
Exactly this. The tax isn't meant to be the source of revenue - it's meant to be leverage for a literal check Mexico writes to us to remove the tax. 
That's actually a really great way of putting it - separating the people from the ideology.

The problem lies in how people perceive the spectrum. They think it's a line. The far right is way the fuck over there ---> and the far left is way the fuck over here <---  \n\n*this is wrong.* the spectrum is a circle , where the far-left and far-right touch end to end. Both ends exhibit the same traits and tendencies--boiling down to power concentrated at the top with a permanent supremacy. They are one and the same where they meet.

There's a podesta email chain with some Japanese guy that eludes to exactly this. Another pede posted it a day or so ago. 
This is what KAC was talking about when she said "alternative facts". It is the number one thing to look for when spotting fake journalism - the distortion of the truth by omitting facts. It is very true that Trump pondered the idea of cutting funds to schools that don't support free speech and association. It is also true there was crazy, violent riots that suppressed such 1st amendment rights. Any organization that doesn't clearly articulate the facts is fake. 
I like the cut of your jib based keto-peddling pede!

They take "disenfranchisement" to absurd levels too  - can't afford ID? We make it free. They don't have transportation to the office, they don't get time off to go, they can't read or write, the offices are over-encumbered and white people have shorter lines. You can never satisfy their belief that ID is a source of discrimination. 
If two teachers produce the same quality and one makes double - that's actually an economic sign that he's getting paid too much. I can get the same quality for half. No employee in any industry wants to hear that, but it's the reality of how economics work. \n\nEdit: to address the first part of your reply. Those are all great questions. I think standardized testing has fatal flaws that don't consider everything you said. I think there are teachers who are genuinely getting pissed on because they choose hard to teach students who because of external circumstances will never achieve the same growth curve as students with everything in their favor. \n\nAnd to your point a good leader would factor that in. If a principal was really a business owner, she would factor all that in and really see which teachers are solid and which need to go. She would make sure what is working is done by all of her staff.

Fetuses have differentiated nerve cells on the 16th day of their development. They have a heartbeat at the 6th week. \n\nI have similar views to you, but I think we all need to come to terms with the time tables of exactly when a clump of cells becomes a living, feeling human. Science will continue to prove that fetuses are humans earlier and earlier. Just some food for thought.

The one thing I would change about your comment - you word it in a way that validates that there is actually such a thing as hate speech. There is not. Hate speech isn't actually a thing. There are threats, there are insults, there are calls to violence. These have varying degrees of legality. Hate speech is some sort of nebulous way of saying "anything speech I don't agree with". Don't validate it.  
I still don't get it. President Trump will close loopholes and remove regulation, but also lower the actual tax rate for corps. So doesn't it just even out?\n\nI suppose you have a point that even though the loop holes and regulations are expensive to navigate, it puts corporations that have the manpower at an advantage, in which case they'd be defending that advantage. \n\nJust thinking out loud at this point. To me I would jump at the possibility of reducing accounting staff, but I guess I'm stupid and not a shitlord. 
I agree - but we need to protect businesses who terminate people who can not pass e-verify. If you read the text in the link, it's pretty clear businesses are left wide open for lawsuits which must change. 
So much trolling:) honestly Austin riff-raff are probably more tolerable than northeastern liberals. 
I'd be for an amendment temporarily barring anyone who takes federal subsidies from voting. There would need to be some clarifications on this (child tax credit - does that Count as a substitute?

You're looking at this the wrong way. It isn't about the actual tax - you are correct in that if you tax something, the demand goes down and that tax revenue dries up - but that's not the point. \n\nTax Mexican imports - we buy elsewhere. That hurts Mexico. Mexico bends the knee. Wall funded through alternate means ("please Presidente Trump, we will pay you for the wall - lift the tax so our imports are attractive again!"). The tax is just leverage. Think dynamically.

> If you forced me to put a pin on the timeline where I thought personhood began, it'd be at the cutoff point for fetal viability, which is around 23 weeks, but technically different for every single fetus.  That's the bare minimum of gestation that a fetus needs in order for technology to keep it alive outside the mother.\n\nIf you know a fetus has a differentiated nervous system within the first 20 days, and an beating heart by the 6th week, and can respond to stimuli as early as 8 weeks, would you be cool with stabbing it or electrocuting it, knowing that it could feel it? \n\nI agree there's a continuum. I just think it's WAY earlier than we all want it to be. I believe it's in the 4-6 week range which the majority of that time is the 'I might not even know I'm pregnant stage'
I look forward to an EO or (if the fucking congress did something) and actual law that made federally funded schools comply with open and diverse 1st amendment activities. \n\nHonestly, as a libertarian, I can't believe I'm at this point. 
I feel this way too. I get why we need to meme it / to bring it to light. But every time I think of podesta and skippy I get really mad -- really furious that there are children being raped by this guy and his shadow government friends. 
And you know what really gets me? Infrastructure is actually on of the thing government is responsible for. The one thing they legitimately need to take care of and they neglect it at both state and federal levels. It's ridiculous.

As soon as the embryo starts dividing, it meets the criteria of [living beings](http://infohost.nmt.edu/~klathrop/7characterisitcs_of_life.htm) (The reproduction item is often cited as "potential to reproduce when mature).\n\nWhen the embryo first divides, DNA is created that is unique and will never be reproduced again. \n\nI'm actually not against stem cell research, but these items are ethically questionable.

I see it, maybe try the link again?\n\nBasically twitter has a new tactic for discouraging people from clicking retweet links. Normally when you quote or retweet a tweet, you see a preview below. In this case all I got was a "this tweet is unavailable" -- but when I click the link to the quoted tweet, it's there. \n\nThis tactic was reported by Scott Adams a while ago when he discovered weird user behavior and analytics on his tweets. 
Religion is but one arm of Islam. It is an ideology encompassing religion, military, politics, economics and codified laws. It is a complete system of human interaction. It is thinly veiled as a religion so it can remain protected.

Yea man it's not just high def displays, it's any external display. I sometimes get inexplicable lag on my 1080p display and I have a 2012 MBP with an AMD GPU. The way OSX renders it's UI is unique. It's similar to running Linux with a compositing layer like Compiz, but in OSX all output is double buffered and synced with the display refresh rate. So if for whatever reason Quartz (the compositing layer in OSX) can't spit out more than 60fps on a given output, it hits the buffer and only feels like 30fps. Everything in OSX is double buffered, even inputs which is what causes OSX to feel slow, even on good hardware. You never get faster than 16.6ms of response.\n

I'm going to have to agree with Mark Cuban on this one. His angle is that we have to prepare the populace for the new types of software and support jobs that are in high demand in current American industries. 2017+ is the true era of the entrepreneur and every entrepreneur needs a team of dedicated, budding leaders to bring their vision to fruition. Manufacturing is only a small fraction of our industry.

He's talking about consensual relationships with boys who've hit puberty and understand what they are doing. Young gay boys are attracted to older gay men because most people their age don't know wtf they want. I think his statements are perfectly defensible while still skating a thin line. The take away is that he's not defending or excusing pedophilia, and he explains why very well. Was it the priest joke that threw you off?
what's going on with that switch configuration?

My Astro A50's have been solid for the last 5 years. 
It's a throwback to the mid 2000's Digg days before they sold out. Ron Paul was our guy but the community was a lot less divided back then. Everyone was a classical liberal, or a true libertarian when it came to the internet and free speech and the federal government. We hated Bush's warmongering, but we weren't attached to the left either. Something happened after Obama won...Digg sold out to the MSM...If you were around back then and you think back it all makes sense now.
Well people do, and honestly it's part of the balance of the game. I made a decent amount of cash playing Halo 2 in 05-06. My whole crew went from CS to Halo 2 when it came out. We were bored of PC shooters and the communities at the time. Halo 2 had a much more dynamic strategy in ranked play and had A TON of fresh meat. It was good times, and it was so much more convenient to play with your buddies.
People get stranded in airports all the time. This small group happens to have attorneys throwing themselves at them for representation as well. Doesn't seem so bad. Most of us want the wall. Heroin is crossing the border in record amounts and nobody is doing anything about it. Trump is doing exactly what we wanted.
Lol he must define pissing as being able to make it into the toilet.
No of course not. Milo clearly wasn't arguing that.\n

I worked the 2010 Census in southern California. It was hard enough getting the legal Californian immigrants to answer the door and list the persons residing in their homes. 
No you wouldn't have. You would have voted Ron Paul. The Right was shilling so hard back then. What we saw in 07-08 was exactly what we saw with Bernie and Hillary this time around but on the opposite end of the spectrum. It was neocons vs libertarians and the problem was we didn't have enough people online to get woke. This was before Facebook really took off as a media platform. Fark and Digg were the established link aggregates as well as some other small social media and message boards that fostered political discussion. What we're seeing now is nothing new, it's just happening on a much grander scale.

Yea I have the original pair that charges with a mini-usb cable haha. They are still solid though, outlasted 2 pairs of G930s. The thing I like about the Logitech is that they have bindable buttons which are great for wireless PTT. The audio really left a lot to be desired though and they did not like Apple devices on the same network. I had to make a separate 5ghz wifi network to connect my iphone and ipad to because it caused very noticeable interference when they were on the 2.4 network.
It means that the left will instantly start comparing him to Hitler.

I've been watching Alex Jones for over a decade and you really have to understand he way of describing things. All the crazy stuff he says, he says because they are so crazy, and it's part of his delivery. If you listen to him, he's taking the angle that "This crazy shit MUST be because of none of this makes any sense" then goes on to expose THE OTHER ANGLE that people are completely missing, which leads them to thinking it doesn't make any sense. In this clip he says he doesn't get into that stuff. It's true, he doesn't have any dedicated content to those pursuing those types of topics. 
Good news: Britain is still a part of the European continent.

I have a lot of money on him being wrong actually, a lot of Trump supports I know do as well...
He should be in jail for treason.
3.4ghz is the base clock and 3.7ghz is the guaranteed turbo clock. I'm gonna assume they use the Wraith cooler and test the chips with ambient air temp between 32-35c. If you can keep temps below that it that it should clock higher when needed. Based on how these things are expected to be priced I'm expecting some pretty beefy turbo clocks on chilled setups.

Probably want people to buy in before they realize there's only like 3 exclusive games worth playing.
Yeah I have a good friend who has a hard time thinking for himself. Buys things based on their popularity, reviews, etc. They cant see that these things are subject to fabrication. It's elitism and it's become a disease.

There's only 3 games worth getting that will be released by next Christmas. \n\nZelda\nMario Kart (which isn't even a new game)\nMario\n*And splatoon if you are into that*\n\nSo over the course of 9 months that's all you get. The rest are just ports of old games. Granted there may be some hidden goodies in there, but it just doesn't seem worth it. You still won't be paying 1000 dollars. $550 tops not counting the inevitable price drop the console will have after people realize this.\n\nUnless they have something exciting planned for the virtual console, it's just not worth it out the gate.

There's already a regulation that prevents water pollution. This was just regulating on the same thing which is why it was removed.

Bing bing bing all the winning everyday. 
AHHHHHHHHHHH YESSSS!
Milo should do his own thing down the street like what trump did for one of the debates. He could do a speech and raise money for some kind of children's charity. 
Illegals should not be able to get a drivers license/ID to begin with. This is such bullshit that they can get the benefits of being a citizen despite not being one.

These baseless attacks on Milo are parallel to what Trump faced during the campaign.\n\n* First: they get accused of being white nationalists, xenophobes, misogynists, etc. \n\n* Second: the attacks do not work so an obscure piece of audio-visual material is brought to light to slander them\n\n* Second and a half: in both cases, the accusations were sexual in nature because of their ability to illicit a strong emotional reaction from the public. This emotional reaction is KEY to the attack because they ensure that those who may hold these individuals in a negative light do not bother listening to the other side's story.\n\n* Third: More "evidence" is brought forward to further "prove" false the allegations in an attempt to bury the individual. 
* Jeff Sessions (Attorney General)\n* Linda McMahon (Administrator of the Small Business Adminstration) \n* Mad Dog Mattis (Sec of Defense)\n* David Shulkin (Secretary of Veterans Affairs)\n* Scott Pruitt (Adminstrator of the EPA)\n* Mick Mulvaney (Director of the Office of Management and Budget)\n* Tom Price (Secretary of Health and Human Services)
Also Benji HATES Milo so it makes sense why he'd spread this kind of shit around.
The problem with Scientology is their leaders, like Miscavage. They're the ones that let the non celebrities get fucked over and abuse them relentlessly. It makes sense why famous people would want to join since they get so much power and connections to their respective industries, like John Travolta can straight up kill someone and the "church" will cover it up. 
Alex Jones should be president, he knows everything about everything it seems like. 
Benji is a scared loser

You fucking idiot, do you know how powerful those people are? These people own the police and are intertwined into the government, there was nothing he could do. 
I really feel that something has to be happening behind the scenes at Warner that keeps messing with the DC universe movies. The marketing looks great for most of these movies and I always hear stories about the studio meddling in the writing and forcing reshoots.
I think he understands his audience is growing up so he's changing up the content for the better. I used to like his screeching gameplay videos when I was young, but now I like the "edgier" jokes he pulls like with the fiverr video.

Also, he was talking about it from his perspective through his experience of being sexually abused by a priest. In order to cope with it, it appears he was claiming to be the aggressor so it won't be "abuse" to him. Apparently this is a common recovery method of people in similar situations.
Kinda like Sarah Silverman thinking construction markings were swastikas.

Amazon doesn't charge until they shipped so you can just cancel the preorder.
An edited clip is going around talking about his own experience of being molested and it's made to look like he supports pedophilia which is a lie. The CPAC has disinvited him since they don't fucking care about the facts and they're just a bunch of bitch-ass never trumpers. 
This isn't some kind of beauty pageant, he is one of the most outspoken victims and that's why I used him. 
There are no strings on them anymore. 
YAY
On Amazon they don't charge your account until it ships.
Sounds pretty good, of course the left has to give him shit for liking a regular food.

It's ridiculous how lefties are always whining about how it's impossible to come in legally when there's all these great folks who can do it. 
Milo has already said that he was a victim of Child abuse, firing him would be a fatal mistake.

Hey Alex, fairly new info wars listener here. I wanted to ask how'd you start talking with Trump, did he reach out to you as a listener? Also, what is your favorite thing to eat at a BBQ cookout?

Spike is such an irrelevant hack
Cannibal Holocaust is an amazing film, probably the best in the found footage genre as well.
They still love Polanski so I think they'd be cool with him. 
I am not making excuses you insufferable twat, he was merely discussing what had happened when he was molested and how he is coping with it. You are shit, sharia blue.

It's funny to read the super petty ones, especially for theme park rides and convenience stores.

It was hilarious to see that LA protester fail to explain how Trump was a danger to the gays. Shows how these people know absolutely nothing and just spout off talking points they absorb from CNN and all the other fake news.
I get you. Chinatown is one of my favorite movies so I don't group the art in with the evils of the director.

It's like what happened to Trump. The "racist, misogynist, xenophobic" baloney didn't work so they started calling him a rapist.

Holy shit
He could afford it too with how loaded he is. If Sam Hyde can self publish a 700 page book, so can Milo.
I got a pretty good idea for one.
WOW they pulled his book???  Amazon sells lots of raunchy things and suddenly they're the moral police?  I was not at all happy with what Milo said in the video that I saw.  I am zero tolerance on that subject.\n\n\nHOWEVER... it is absolutely nuts that amazon pulled his book.  Is there a precedent for this?  I don't recall this ever happening to anyone or anything before, other than the Confederate flag.
I hope he has some badass security.
Yes it does.  But aside from that, if they were able to look into the womb, see faces, hear / see heartbeats, see reactions to pain... the things that we can do now... the ruling would have been different.  This ruling was made before we were able to do any of those things.
so many of us "wrong" white people voted for obama in 2008.  we didn't voe for Trump because we're fucking racists.  but i guess the longer it takes dems to figure that out, the better.
i really don't know what you're talking about unless you just mean you don't think pedogate is real.  if that's the case, i wish you were right.
ha.  well i don't know what else to do.
yes.
any reason at all to believe him?
fair enough
Elaborate? 
thanks i'm going to look at it again.
well he said he was.
I am anxiously waiting to hear more from our President and/or Attorney General and/or oversight committees.  There are so many people and so many things that need to be investigated.  I feel like every day I'm just checking the Donald a million times, hoping to see some action.   There's probably action behind the scenes but I'm hungry to be told.
yeah, dumb probably isn't the right way to put it.  but a lot of them do seem to lack common sense.  maybe that has to do with the hubris.  it's like they literally forget that they have weaknesses and they can be completely caught off guard by attacks that they would have seen if they were using common sense.
downvotes?  do we have some child rapers in our midst?
yeah.  I tried to do that twice last night.  Interesting discussion began to ensue.  Then the threads were shadow banned.  Really fucked up.  People are acting like because Milo has fucked up views due to being abused, we're supposed to accept those fucked up views.
well it was what milo himself said in that video that made me go "wait man... no."
Is he still on for CPAC?  If he is, it'll be the most watched CPAC in God knows how long.
you're bad.  lol
I empathize with Milo and the fact that he was an abuse victim.  But there's no way I'm giving him a free pass after saying something like this  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azC1nm85btY&t=3552s&app=desktop\n\n\nI stand with President Trump, and frankly I doubt President Trump is amused that he is now tangentially associated to someone who said the things above.
it will be here, no doubt
I don't want him to censor himself.  I want them to be loud.  I was just curious what risks are associated with that in Sweden.
I thought I did know.  I was going by the video.  I figured video was more accurate evidence than just what someone wrote.  Lesson learned.
lol
They do.  It's time to stop playing. 
So when are ya'll gonna march on your politicians?  Get all the real Swedes together and make a public statement of asking for our help.  I believe the US will help Europe.  We have to be asked though, loudly and clearly.  The people of Europe need to stand up and speak up for themselves about what is really going on.
Do you guys think President Trump is fully briefed on what's REALLY going on with the Milo thing?  With Bannon nearby, I hope so.
I've been watching what's happening over there for a year and a half now, so yes I believe it.
Clearly this is all president trumps fault /s
Fuck "multiculturalism."  Return to "melting pot" mentality.  If you can't overall be part of the whole then gtfo.
Probably.  Tucker is quickly gaining a cult following, myself included.
I love that tweet.  Now even if Ellison is the best person, they'll be falling all over themselves second guessing because President Trump praised him.  lol
Yes, and she probably is.
Don't give them that much credit yet.  If enough of us see through it in time, Milo will be stronger than ever.
Maybe.  I'm not really sure about him.  It would be nice to know.  Maybe truths will come out with Trump's presidency.
If he can first definitively clear up what sounded like him promoting "consensual" sex between 13 y/o boys and grown men... then I'd be all for going after pizzagate.  He needs to clear it up though and address what he really said.  (His response that he wrote on facebook did not.)
He said nothing about suing, but he should.
That fucker should have been out of DC looooooong ago.  And if he does belong in jail, I hope he ends up there.
When it's a liberal, they're not responsible for the people who endorse them.  This, class, is what we call a double standard.
I'm sure that's why he said what he said.  I still can't stand behind someone as a "voice" for us though, when he is espousing those kinds of fucked up viewpoints.  I empathize with why he is how he is, but it's still something I can accept being put out there and associated with us... especially when we've got pizzagate stuff probably coming on the horizon soon.
can so relate
yep
yeah I don't approve either.  I find it disturbing that so many are doing mental gymnastics to excuse the things he said there, which are clearly fucked up...
buzzfeed?  they aren't even news imo, and do they have a "news room"?  it's gotta be cnn.
One must view the video in question before forming an opinion.   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azC1nm85btY&t=3552s&app=desktop
except that he said this...  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azC1nm85btY&t=3552s&app=desktop
I was also abused as a child.  The idea that a 13 y/o boy is the one who is the "predator" is nonsense.  I get why Milo would want to believe that, but it isn't true and it gives a loophole and excuse to sick men who take advantage of young boys.
Do you think it's only in he US?  nope...
I'm not going to talk about it anymore after this thread, so you won't see any more from me.  I just needed to say my peace.  I really liked Milo.  To me it's not a narrative.  It's just what I unfortunately found last night when I listened to the video.  (I read his response first, by the way, because my initial reaction was to NOT believe what was being said about him.)  I know we're not responsible for what someone says.  I just know that I for one will not make excuses for what he said in one breath and in the next breath be calling for the prosecution of all the elite sicko pedophiles.  That's all...
gotta have something on him... only thing i know of is that creepy rape essay he wrote in the 70s or something.  i'm saying more like something that's like "damn dude" like no respectable human being could listen to him anymore.  i'm not sure if something like that exists but if it does i hope it comes out.  cause bernie people seriously need to get the fuck over it at this point.
activity on redacted is way down too though.  reddit can't win this game.  they are dying in slow motion because they are trying to censor the views that are most popular.
Are you going to try to barricade the entrances to your school and throw rocks at his car and burn trash in the street?\n\nOh yeah, that's right... you're not a liberal.
I wonder if it's really that important to release "hundreds of hours"... why not just release what's relevant... or release all of it for verified context, but also single out what's relevant?

I love this possibility.  Please let this be it.
I love how he throws around "NOT!" with no shame.  lol.
I'm being serious.  I've watched the DP video and Joe Rogan and I don't see it looking or sounding edited at all.  A lot of people are saying it is, so it would be great if someone would point out where / when it is edited...
That's the million dollar question.  The current establishment media doesn't need to just be distrusted.  They need to be literally replaced.
That is twitter's doing.  There are a few people who they always push to the top of the comment feed.  This shit is why silicon valley needs to drown in a sea of anti-trust lawsuits.  They are absolutely BRAZEN right now in their selective "free speech."
I was very upset about people "defending" milo for a little over a day.  Eventually someone was able to show me though, the spots where the video is edited.  It isn't an actual conversation the way it actually went.  They took him talking about when he himself was abused at age 13 and put it in as an answer about a different question, to make it look like he was advocating for 13 y/o's to have relationships with adults.\n\nActually, Milo (like a lot of abuse victims) simply didn't want to think of himself as a "victim" so instead he chose trying to frame it as "I Milo gave consent at age 13."  Make sense?  I would say Milo has some stockholm syndrome and was defending the "relationship" and his abuser.  Those words were put together with a different conversation to paint the picture of someone advocating abuse.
I have watched the whole video that I posted.  If there's something else I should be watching PLEASE share it with me and I'll gladly watch it.
have you guys all watched this video though?  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azC1nm85btY&t=3552s&app=desktop\n\nMilo ain't right about this, and in my opinion if we stand behind this we WILL be hypocrites and the left will get what they want.  I know that Milo was abused and that undoubtedly colors his views here, but his views are still wrong.  For the record *I did read* his response.  I actually did so before watching the above video because my initial reaction was to think "this accusation is probably bullshit."  The video directly contradicts what he wrote though.  Anyone who has not watched it needs to do so before forming an opinion.
He still won't say that?  Cause that's pretty ridiculous.  I kind of thought it was agreed upon that he'd just run symbolically but then he didn't "keep up his end" by dropping out or something.
I actually thought it was too at first, and I sought out Milo's response first.  The video fooled me though when I saw it.  =(
This bitch needs to be hit with a multi million dollar libel suit!
child molesters are horrible people.  may they get exactly what they deserve.  at the very least, may they be purged from our midst.
That pepe is clearly out for vengeance.
The ptb want Trump gone because he is going to oversee the prosecution of their crimes against humanity.
I honestly don't think that they and most of Europe will be able to do it without our help.  The citizens there are disarmed.
My opinion is that abortion is murder, and if Roe v Wade were tried today, the ruling would have been different... because science.  Also, knowing that killing a baby is wrong isn't just courting "Christian orthodoxy."
calm down... i didn't downvote you...
hahahaha... only the most braindead of the braindead would fall for calling him "lazy."  even people who don't like him know that he's anything but lazy.
get out bioch... there are literally millions of other people who would do a better job than you in the press room.
yeah we probably just seem totally obnoxious to people who don't get it, lol
If they did anything to help, hmm maybe it's cause they already KNEW what a truly evil person she is?  hmm just a hunch.
Yep. Totally disgusting. 
Getting tired of the leaks being telegraphed forever in advance.  Just do it.  This isn't just for O'Keefe, but in general.
Well my opinion WAS swayed for quite a while.  I'm so furious at pedophiles these days that I just wanted to be DOUBLE SURE that I wasn't letting someone off the hook and being a hypocrite.  It's so infuriating that someone did this.  It would be awesome if charges could be brought for libel!
I want to message her but the the link doesn't work.\n\nCAN YOU MESSAGE HER?  TELL HER...\n\n**DO NOT** LET THAT BABY OUT OF HER SIGHT!!!\n\nTELL HER NO MATTER WHAT THEY SAY BABY STAYS WITH HER OR WITH TRUSTED FAMILY MEMBER!!!\n\nThis is horrifying.  I am going to pray right now for that baby.
nice find
There are so many gonna have to pull out the research but yeah let's get a nice big list going.
You are absolutely correct that it's nowhere near the same thing.  It's not even in the same galaxy.  However, after watching the videos last night, I personally decided it's best to keep distance from promoting Milo because it is just WAY TOO EASY for the true evil people to use our "defending" him as a defense for themselves.
too many people are falling for it though
the "truth" seems to be subjective.  everyone keeps saying the video was edited but i don't see where or how...
Yeah I am not cool with what milo said, and I'm not going to pretend I am.  It's pretty obvious though that "they" are going after HIM in particular because they're afraid of his message on things like islam.  "They" couldn't care less about all the other creepers out there.
Yep I wasn't going to buy it, but now I will.
yeah.... HUGE PROTEST of 2 dozen people... ridiculous.
they do though.  they also ran a creepy ass ad during the super bowl with people playing... ping pong... and suggesetive voice going "ooooh yeaaah"... fuck pizza hut.
That video didn't / doesn't appear edited to me.  Do you happen to have a link to the one you're saying isn't edited?  Serious question.
A lot of them are too dumb to realize what they've done.  How do all these dumb people get into the most powerful positions?  I think it must be that they're chosen by the real "elites" behind the curtain... because they have vices and are easily blackmailed and controlled.
if not for citizen journalism we would have no idea what's really going on in Europe.  God bless these people.

My current Footjoys are last year's model.  They have the BOA system, and I haven't had a single issue yet.  I actually really like the BOA style as I like to just slip on shoes.  \n\nMy price point was hoping to be around $100, but I've considered ECCO as well, which are almost always higher.  Maybe I can find a deal on the FJ.  
Your argument would have more bearing if this actually weren't 'left shilling' which it so clearly is.  
Vayo is ignoring one the simple rules in poker:  if you are not aggressive enough to get people to fold on the flop or turn, your hand is going to get drawn out on fairly often, and you also leave yourself open to be bullied off pots on the turn or river.  \n\nI know Vayo is trying to trap Nguyen into bluffing off a huge amount, but you still have to pick up the smaller pots on the flop or turn.  
And you are using this platform and tragedy to spread your anti-Trump narrative. Stop acting holier than thou. 
Anyone else noticed the incredibly loud screaming girl on every snap of the ball. Sounds like bloody murder. Not sure which mic is picking it up, but it is quite annoying. 
I had not seen that video, and it was great.  Even at no benefit to him, all Trump cared about was avoiding wasted money and fraud.  Makes me smile even wider knowing that he will be leading this country.  \n
I think what Rubio was pointing out was the difference between the the Republicans obstructionism against Obama and the Democrats current obstructionism.  \n\nI can't deny that many Republicans tried to prevent many of Obama and the Democrats policies for the last 8 years.  But there is a large difference between dissenting through cordial debate and dissenting by character bashing and hyperbole.  \n\nI'm sure I am older than most on this site, and I have never seen so many blatant, baseless, and outlandish character assassinations promoted by our leaders.  I don't believe the Republicans are innocent of this by any stretch, but the majority of this filth is stemming from the Democrats.  \n\nAlthough Rubio acknowledged that Warren may not have intended to turn the Senate chambers into a Salem witch trial, her words surely did.  If the Senate cannot have meaningful and passionate debates without resorting to name-calling and reputation bashing, then there will not be a single place in this country that can do the same.  \n\n
Sadly, he is using that excuse to call for increased taxes and  flavor bans.

First of all, I'll assume you are referring to the KKK...which is not a large organization as you claim.  In fact, estimates are that there are only 5,000 to 8,000 members.  \n\nSecondly, the republican party does not cater any messages to nor do they support the KKK.  I'm not sure where you got the idea that the GOP crafts their message to cater directly to this group...but you are flat out wrong and spreading lies.

As a non-vet, VA reform is one of the most important reforms that is needed.  Too many young men and women my age are still suffering and aren't provided timely and adequate care that they rightfully deserve.

He is taking a principled stance of the law.  He said if he thought a student was illegal, he would report ICE.  \n\nHow is it all of the sudden deemed wrong or immoral to report criminal activities.  We are a nation of laws.  You can immigrate here legally.  I know the system currently is plagued by red tape and bureaucracy, and it needs to be reformed and streamlined.  But that doesn't mean that people can just stream in here illegally because the system is slow.  \n\nAnd he is also making a good point emphasized by your comment:  people that came here illegally are "illegal immigrants" not "undocumented citizens."  That type of PC terminology is total bullshit.  
I'm so sick of hearing 100% negative stories about vaping from major government or health institutions.  They aren't concerned  about our health.  They are concerned about the almighty dollar.  They use our vices and addictions as a source of revenue, and it is despicable.  \n\nIf they cared about our health, they would be promoting the use of ecigs for adult smokers as a cessation or harm reduction method.  But rather they drum up the old 'think of the children' argument so that they can increase their scope of sin taxes.

It's sad.  
Regardless of the election outcome, you deserve thanks for pursuing true journalism.  You spent over a year of your life organizing an effort to expose just how dirty the DNC is.  We need more journalists with your drive and dedication.  \n\nSo from me personally, THANK YOU!

> I'm not saying pretty much all Republicans are racist, but pretty much all racists are republican.\n\nThis isn't even remotely true.  You do realize that it isn't just white people that can be racist, right?  I'm sure you only associate racism with republicans and white people because that is all that the left-leaning news feeds you.  But take a step back from the media, and you will see that there are plenty of hateful and racist people on either side of the aisle.

Why am I not 50 points ahead? 
No worries - I didnt take it that way at all.\n\nMy whole psyche was fucked.  I was often confused about relationships and the manner of how they should be appreciated.  Around 12-13 i became clingy to my girl friends.  I attribute this to my abuser leaving me.  I couldnt find my life, or the meaning of life.  Not saying thats rare, I was just forced to have a different outlook on life at such an early age.  This brought a high level of dissatisfaction and discontent in both female and male relationships.\n\nbut honestly, I was just depressed from a very early age, and without a cognitive reason.  My mom actually sent to a psychologist with no help.

Oh ya.  I was a 2nd grader receiving.  It always bothered me.  Ive always had guilt about the situation.  Even to this day.   I just came out about the ordeal..  on Reddit.  Its easier for me to have conversation with strangers than with my wife or fiance.

i honestly never thought about her children.  I should take it into consideration, but dont know if something that happen 15+ years ago warrants any attention now, though.  
I honestly couldnt imagine if it were a male.  my experience created a bit of confusion with sexual identity, but i never got lost due to an understanding of my changed psyche.\n\nI share the same dishonosty type of feelings.  You/we cant define any better than utter confusions.  We were both manipulated, and we have spent a long time trying to figure out what the hell is reality.\n\nI too, again, was scared to death about the "Truth or dare?" situation.  Then, one day i decided it wasnt my fault - early 20's.  \n\nSorry about your situation, man.  You have to remember, gay or not, you didnt chose that life or those actions, consenting or not - like some idiot earlier tried to insinuate.  You can only control the present and future.  Forgive yourself, brother.  Bringing good into this world will give your life meaning.
I think 15, but I can remember.  She was old enough to understand what was going on.  I stated earlier that maybe my title should have stated "girl" rather than woman.  But it continued into her early adulthood.

I think the point of the post is that Obama has killed thousands of Muslims and the country barely batted an eye.  Trump temporarily restricts travel and people are freaking the fuck out.
ohh, I didnt even notice the typo.  \n\nWhile not working, I do not spell check.  Too lazy
We did engage in intercourse, little though from what I can remember.  I stopped out of the blue, but not sure exactly how it stopped.  It never went public, so it didnt stop from someone stepping in, though.  \n\nI have heard from her.  Id still consider her a friend, I guess.  Shes doing well with children and married.  no clue where she lives.  Like I said, I grew up with her brother. 
Probably when it ended.  Now that Im looking back at it, I remember my older brother being the one to step in.  haha  - and now I can actually remember the conversation vaguely.  He never liked it, and this specific conversation revolved around me having to be the one to make an effort not to see this person any longer.  He helped me.  I need to thank him for that.\n\nEdit - I was always aware that it was more than experimenting because she had boyfriends that I would meet.  She was well older than I.  We had nothing in common, other than a relationship with her brother.\n
Just put-up a new one.  Let me know what you think
thats a good question.  Almost as if I grew to love the girl.  The manipulation is strong and can last a life time.  Just like Milo's remarks, and even George T's.  Youre eternally changed.  Youre entire paradigm is flipped upside down.\n\nIve learned to be a forgiving person at this point in my life.  mostly impart to being tired of being sick and tired.
We lived on the same street.  I was friends with her brother.  \n\nI cant actually remember how it started.  I do remember being in 2nd grade and it being an issue.
Are you talking about the ages between 10-12?  or 15-17?\n\nI truly believe its all circumstantial.  ive said previously that I enjoyed it, but enjoying it doesnt mean I wasnt manipulated, or groomed for that matter.  Enjoying it is what caused a large chunk of the mental anguish for myself.\n\nAs far as placing blame on the initiator, its could be more beneficial to focus on ones decision making processes.  That a lot of our decision making skill relay empirically.  \n\nEither way, at such a young age, even in the early teens, guilt should be contested by the circumstances.  Early teens and younger still experiment - and this experience can still be traumatic.  
good looking out!
its hurt my relationships with women.  Trust issues being the worst.  Even in grade school, I could never trust my girlfriend.\n\nIt caused depression as well.  An unidentified cause of depression in my teens, which turned into rage and alcoholism from the age of 16 through 23.\n\nWas sexually promiscuous for the better part of 12 years as well.
Appreciate it.  Im good now.  I was molested, and not rapped.  I feel horrible for what others go through.
anyone that supported this c*nt after the release of her books admission is a piece of shit, including anyone that watches her show.  The public needs to be aware that these intentions do not magically leave your paradigm over night.  Shes still, to this day, a sick and twister bitch.

and in case you were wondering what the legal definition is - \n\nmolestation\n\nn. the crime of sexual acts with children up to the age of 18, including touching of private parts, exposure of genitalia, taking of pornographic pictures, rape, inducement of sexual acts with the molester or with other children, and variations of these acts by pedophiles. Molestation also applies to incest by a relative with a minor family member, and any unwanted sexual acts with adults short of rape. (See: pedophilia, rape)
confirmed
Very much so.  It would be tough for me to act like I could give some advice on the situation.  Its still a very early age for consent to be considered.  It very possibly could be considered manipulation and trust.  Like you said, there are cases that are FAR FAR more complicated that what words can explain.  Rather than focusing on labels its important to focus on confusion, focusing on rehabilitation,  and understanding that many people experience situations such as this. 
well the pedo sympathizers have made it into the thread - name checks out.  Welcome!\n\nI was 6 when it began, so no, I wasnt consenting.  It started when she was 15 and ended in her 20's, while she was in college.  \n\nNow, to say that I didnt grow to enjoy would be a lie.  To say I wasnt brainwashed or manipulated to enjoy it would also be untrue.\n\nWhen exactly do you consider a female to be a women, when they start menstruating?\n\n

Good question, I was waiting for this one.  I was very promiscuous, and dangerous in my teens and through my 20s.  I cheated on almost all my girlfriends, and now feel guilty about it.\n\nIt has been a quest to do more.  experience more.  I can go into greater detail, but for a better lack of an explanation, experiencing sex at an early age, sex never was enough as an adult.
that's how I've framed it up, and the reason I wouldn't want to bring any attention to her.

Being an adult, I can acknowledge the difficulties ive endured, and will continue to endure.\n\nIts important for everyone to realize that once it happens the persons childhood has been taken away from them.  For me, it went from thinking about toy cars and toy soldiers to thinking about boobies and why I was erect while in 2nd grade class.  makes me sick thinking about it.
I would say it first started around 15, so not a full blown adult.  Still old enough to know what she was doing.  Then led into her adulthood.  Im actually not sure though.\n\nafter saying this, maybe the title should read "girl"?  
I like it.  Ill take everyones input and make a "community meme"

Let's not forget that these retards would have you take their political positions seriously....
Obviously Bill Maher has no idea what he's talking about, because by the definition, women can absolutely rape/ molest males.\n\nI think it has escalated quickly.  These people are opportunists that used Milo's situation, and then his poor choice of words, against him.  Whatever side you support, this has quickly gotten out of control.  \n\nBill Maher's comment also address the social norm when I was enduring my situation.  I believe it was from 98, correct?  It was the good ole "I'm getting some pussy" and high fiving time.  This is the mentality that needs to be addressed, even today.  It fucked me up.  Its fucked Milo up.  It fucks everyone up - even if it happened only once, and with the most beautiful girl in the world, it still rips your childhood away from you.
I could have explained this better.  The message from what youre saying is the message that needs to get to the masses - I was forced to experience something that, in turn, has caused damage.  Essentially, we both had our childhoods taken away from us.  We didnt realize it then, and might have seemed "cool" during a certain period of time.  Being adults we can look back at it now and realize the damage it has caused.\n\nWhat got me over the "hump" was realizing that I couldnt fight any longer.  With my friends, with women, with my family, and with my self.  There's nothing I can do to change the past, but I can influence the future from my misfortune. \n\nI wish I could give you some advice, but there's nothing that words can do to help you find someone.  Though, keep this in mind (and what I tell myself often)  Accept others for who they are.  pretty simple, I know.  But this helped me enjoy life rather than always seeking the bad in others.
confirmed - Thanks man
I love the Shilled Cucks coming into our sub to get their asses handed to them.  Pure cuckary at its finest.
Oh, that is super spicy...
Im trying to recall how things went down exactly.  Sorry for your experience.
Well, as boys talk, we talked.  I was always the guy that was getting more than anyone else.  Some would call bullshit because I never said who it was or her age.  I was def brainwashed from an early age.\n\nI wish I knew where the shame came from.  Its weird, because still to this day I feel ashamed.  Maybe it was because I liked it, or because i never spoke up, or because i was being abused and didnt know I was actually being abused.
She did not.  I dont think I would want her to get in trouble either.
I fell alright.  Still processing it.  \n\nAlmost dirty to an extent.  Im 50/50
I think 15 when it all started.  Im still having trouble remembering the exact age we were.  I do though, have a fond memory and being in the second grade.
Sold him 1.5m - He went first.  incremental.  Super easy deal.  Dude is legit.
I dont believe this AMA has to be verified.  I could be wrong, though.
Appreciate that.\n\nNo, she wouldnt have stopped.  I do remember trying to end it, without luck.  \n\nIt was all manipulation.  Actually, I cant remember when it first started, or how.  What I do remember, and thanks to someone else talking about Truth or dare, it evolved into a game of Truth or dare.  Always starting out with a kiss.\n\nThanks for the kind words. I feel like im "over it" but will always feel that shame.  Its a planted seed.
no no, yeah, sorry.  Wasnt trying to imply anything there.\n\nAll of the above.  It was more manipulation rather than forced.
That you must remind yourself that its ok, its not your fault, and that acknowledging this in an attempt to help others is better than doing nothing.\n\nI hear that shame is common, as well as depression.  Reminding ourselves that it wasnt our fault is very important.  For some reason, im seeing myself wishing no harm against my predator.  I dont know why.\n\nFor adults, especially with children.  My advice would be to pay close attention to who you bring around you children.  Get to know their mannerisms. \n\nI just came out with this info yesterday, so im still processing a lot.  I dont even know if at this very moment I can give the best advice. \n
I joined.  Thanks for the extra work pede!

This holds true to my state - Im a man, and therefor I needed to act like one.  I was the youngest of 3 brothers, so I had extra pressure to be the toughest.\n\nId like to be some sort of an advocate, but Im still in the early stages of acknowledging that it actually happened.  Even with this minor AMA, Im finding myself with little to say, or being stumped.  End goal has to be some sort of advocacy work.  I fear that I couldnt or wouldnt be able to provide the proper advice.  Maybe I need to understand that just being there for someone is enough.  It is still a sensitive subject, and I believe this thread is the beginning of opening up about it.  What innitatied all of this was the public humiliation brought onto Milo and George Takei - which I dont take sides in this case, and serves as a perfect example with them being on the opposite sides of the political spectrum.  Its disgusting watching the manipulation from the media and those on the opposite sides.\n\nBack to this conversation - I honestly had no idea how common it is.  We, the public, rarely hear anything about males being molested, unless its committed by a male?  and I could be wrong with that statement.\n\nI cant recall the school having the molestation conversation - which could just have been a mental block.  As a young kid, I truly believe if someone would have talked to me like an adult, rather than the "show me on the doll where you were touched", the conversation would have gone much further.  I am interested if your father and husband feel as though, that day, they became an adult, and adversely lost their childhood?  I remember becoming very pessimistic at an early age - due to this long lived experienced.
Ive received a few encouraging responses during this, yours is included on top of that list.  \n\nI think its the personality shifter Id like to focus on, and that its forever changed.
as I was sitting here trying to remember how it started, I realized she went to a catholic grade school.  I went to public.\n\nNot saying anything happened to her, but I have this uncontrollable desire to forgive and not blame her.

History\n\nSeine-Saint-Denis was created in January 1968, through the implementation of a law passed in July 1964. It was formed from the part of the (hitherto larger) Seine department to the north and north-east of the Paris ring road (and the line of the old city walls), together with a small slice taken from Seine-et-Oise.\n\nSeine-Saint-Denis has a history as a veritable left-wing stronghold, belonging to the ceinture rouge (red belt) of Paris. The French Communist Party especially has maintained a continued strong presence in the department, and still controls the city councils in cities such as Saint-Denis, Montreuil and La Courneuve. Until 2008, Seine-Saint-Denis and Val-de-Marne were the only departments where the Communist Party had a majority in the general councils but the 2008 cantonal elections saw the socialists become the strongest group at the Seine-Saint-Denis general council (while the Communist Party gained a majority in Allier and lost it in 2015).\n\nA commune of Seine-Saint-Denis, Clichy-sous-Bois, was the scene of the death of two youths which sparked the nationwide riots of autumn 2005. In October - November, 9,000 cars were burned and 3,000 rioters were arrested.\n\nDemographics\n\nSeine-Saint-Denis is the French department with the highest proportion of immigrants: 21.7% at the 1999 census (see table below). This figure does not include the children of immigrants born on French soil as well as some native elites from former French colonies and people who came from overseas France. The ratio of ethnic minorities is difficult to estimate accurately as French law prohibits the collection of ethnic data for census taking purposes. However estimates suggest there are 500,000 Muslims out of a total population of 1.53 million (32.7%). Saint-Denis is home to the Union of French Islamic Organizations (UOIF) in the Bourget district, which annually hosts one of Europe's major Muslim conferences, Paris-le-Bourget.\n\nIn 2005, 56.7% of young people under 18 were of foreign origin including 38% of African origin (22% from Maghreb and 16% from Sub-Saharan Africa). Islam is believed to be the most practiced religion in the department.[1][2]

> It's not about damaging decibel levels, necessarily. Even an 80dB explosion, well within the safe range for human ears, would be intolerable if it were unexpected/unannounced.\n\nUnexpected/unannounced 80 dB noises happen all the time in major cities - god, in many cases that's roughly the ambient noise level - and they used to be very common near airports (though FAA noise restrictions have been very effective in reducing the overall noise footprint of airports over the last 20 or 30 years).\n\ne: the OKC tests involved booms with overpressures about 60% as large as the Concorde (60 psf vs 100 psf) but there were tests in Chicago and (I think) Kansas City that used ~100 psf overpressures\n\ne2:\n\n>even modern military fighters, with all their technology, do not fly supersonic over US soil.\n\nThey do.

A lot of the things that have been preserved over the years have been preserved specifically because they were something special.  Only rich people got tombs, and only tombs survived to the present day.  So is it that surprising that the things we discover in those tombs are much nicer than you might expect an ordinary person to have? You're right, most of the swords made by the ancient Egyptians were almost certainly not at all ornate. But Tutankhamun was important enough and rich enough to afford a very pretty sword. And since he had people to do his fighting for him he didn't have to worry about it getting messed up.

There are two mechanisms for removing a President, whether temporarily or permanently.\n\nOne: The President decides he is not able to execute faithfully the office of the Presidency.  Maybe this is temporary (e.g. if he's going under anaesthesia for surgery) or maybe it's permanent.  He invokes the 25th Amendment and the Vice President becomes Acting President.  Until and unless the President affirms he is able to execute his office again, the Vice President continues as Acting President.  Obviously, this mechanism is not likely to happen if someone is completely compromised but in the event of something like a blackmail attempt it might work out.\n\nTwo: The President is impeached in the House of Representatives and removed from office by the Senate.  This requires a simple majority of the House of Representatives, and a two-thirds vote in the Senate.  Although the Constitution says that the President can only be removed if they commit "Treason, Bribery, or other high Crimes and Misdemeanors", in practice the question of what constitutes a "high Crime [or] Misdemeanor" is what the courts call "nonjusticiable" because it is a "political issue". What that means is that the House could impeach the President for just about anything, and if the Senate convicts the President and removes him from office, there is no appeal to the courts.  It's final and irreversible.

What are you suggesting, that studios should sell their content to streaming video providers like they sold VCR cassettes to Blockbuster? That is, the provider buys a particular instance of a stream for a given amount of money?  This is basically how e-book licensing works for libraries.  It has a lot of artificial complexities - the biggest of which are that e-books "expire" after a certain number of uses and have to be re-purchased by the library, and also that the library can only have X users reading the book at the same time, where X is the number of licenses they have purchased - that kill a lot of the major benefits of e-delivery of content. 
I judge everybody all the time.  I'm judging you right now.
> I don't see how "I said I don't send nudes to anyone for any reason, ever," is a "negotiable" response. It's a no.\n\nPretty simple - not *sending* nudes doesn't mean you're not open to receiving them. 
> Sonic boom - a loud explosion-like noise that is made around a supersonic aircraft. A sonic boom cannot be eliminated.\n\nThere's no compelling reason a modern SST shouldn't be allowed to go supersonic at 60,000+ feet AGL (which is where they would cruise). The magnitude of the shock at ground level is not significantly damaging at that point. Concorde was banned from going supersonic over the US mainland basically for political reasons, not because the sonic boom was/would have been a real problem. And while it's true that the sonic boom is a fundamental phenomenon that can't be eliminated, the characteristics that allow it to propagate through 12 miles of air down to ground level can be modified, and there has been significant research in this area since the design of the Concorde.  Mitigation is very possible.
Snapping a brastrap is not OK but to suggest that it is "sexual violence" and therefore worse than, or even comparable to, a punch in the face is just crazy to me. And using the term sexual violence to lump it in with rape dilutes the term and makes it likelier that people will take rapes less seriously if they are just called sexual violence without being specific.
Why would I lock the doors? The car's parked next to the house.
Sure. I grew up in a 5-person household with 3 bedrooms in about 1,000 sq ft. I had to share a 10x10 bedroom with my brother. It wasn't terrible but having my own bedroom would have been nice, especially during both my and my brother's teenage years.  But when OP says "tiny home" he's not talking about a home that's 1,400 sq ft instead of 2,400 sq ft.  He's talking about a home that's like 300 sq ft.  And that's an appalling situation to force a child into.

> They can compete in the same way video stores did, and in the same way any two competitors that provide the same product do.\n\nNot really.  Video stores competed on the basis of content and physical location.  If you want a system where online streaming services all have the same library (e.g. because of compulsory licensing), then there's no differentiators between competitors, since the Internet is everywhere.

There are a lot of laws that people break completely unafraid of the consequences.\n

It is usually a fireable offense for employees to take stuff like that home, so that they don't have an incentive to, say, get their friends to "accidentally" leave out a steak.
So what, exactly, is it that's different about the context that makes this creepy? As a private Catholic high school the school is well within its rights to require pre-approval of prom outfits.
>But it's still illegal. If you think a law is unfair, address it. You don't get to pick and choose which ones to follow based on what you feel is right. \n\nOne of the most effective ways to get a "crime" eliminated is to commit it in droves, both to burden the justice system and to highlight its inequity. When the civil rights movement did sit-ins and refused to move to the back of buses, they were breaking the law.
The radius of a galaxy is ~100,000 light years (this is the Milky Way's radius) while the radius of a planet is ~1 * 10^-9 light years (radius of the Earth is 6.734 × 10^-10 light years).  This means a galaxy is 10^14 times as large as a planet.  On the other hand, 13.5 billion light years is only 3.375 * 10^8 times as large as 40 light years.  Overall that means that, without accounting for the fact that a galaxy emits a shitload of light and a planet does not, the galaxy should be 10^14 / 10^8 = 10^6, or ***one million*** times as easy to see as a planet.\n\n**To say it without involving math: a galaxy is so much bigger than a planet that even a galaxy at 13.5 billion light years away is still *a million* times bigger than a planet 40 light years away. On top of that, a galaxy emits a tremendous amount of light while a planet emits essentially 0 light.**
> Can you cite that statute? Parental consent can reduce the age of marriage yes but I'm not aware of any laws whatsoever that say it also reduces the age of consent. They can be married but it'd still be illegal for them to have sex\n\nIn a lot of states age of consent laws explicitly do not apply to married couples. Here is the pertinent part of Georgia's law defining statutory rape as an example:\n\n>[A person commits the offense of statutory rape when he or she engages in sexual intercourse with any person under the age of 16 years ***and not his or her spouse***](http://law.justia.com/codes/georgia/2006/16/16-6-3.html)\n\nAnd in states where there is no explicit exemption for stat rape laws for married couples, the fact of a marriage can still be used, often successfully, as a defense against prosecution.
Wait, are you criticizing the Obamas for schmoozing with the rich?
Jesus, I feel bad for her sons. Hopefully they have a strong father figure.
Yeah.  Somerville is badly underserved by the T.  The Green Line Extension is and was supposed to address that to a limited extent, but unfortunately we all know it's gone into the shitter.  The problem you mentioned is just one of a million pieces of evidence that Boston would benefit tremendously from a wheel, not just a hub and spokes (that is, we need a circumferential rail line!).
> No, it’s like trying to justify racial profiling. It's inconveniencing/scrutinizing people based purely on their gender. It’s sexist by definition. All you’re really saying is that you think this form of sexism is justified.\n\nOK then, I'm saying I think this form of sexism is justified. \n\nHow do you think this Catholic high school should address dress-code compliance issues at their prom? Should they send girls home on the night of the event without giving them any guidance beforehand on whether their particular dress would be acceptable? Because that's what they would do if they had a non-compliance situation with a boy.  They'd send him home.\n\n>If the people being subjected to it think it’s creepy, then it is creepy, to them. That is how subjective descriptors work.\n\nFine.  I don't think it's reasonable to be creeped out.
Cyrillic is derivative of Greek, as St. Cyril was Greek
In the US, professional child care like that required in an orphanage is a very low paying profession. People with Master's degree in social work make $40k low. Employers exploit the fact that the people interested in that kind of work don't do it for the money. As a result it can be hard to maintain appropriate staffing. It is also a very high stress field for the caregivers, which leads to a lot of turnover.
> Understand they choose to do this.\n\nUnfortunately this isn't universally true.  Sex trafficking isn't that uncommon, even in the US.   That said, without any specific reason to believe that a particular woman is trafficked or a particular business participates in trafficking, it's not something people should feel bad about when going to a strip club.
It's an op-ed. Walter Cronkite's real ghost would understand what that means.
There is zero reason that heating in the microwave would affect the flavor of the tea l, unless you're heating the water in something that leaches chemicals. If the water is at 200 degrees F, it neither knows not cares how it got there.
[Incidental copies that are only produced in the course of performing a licensed activity are not a violation of copyright law.](https://www.law.berkeley.edu/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/craincidentalcopies.pdf)  \n\nI suppose that if you have a physical DVD player in a physical building and you only allow a single stream from that particular DVD player, it would be OK to stream it over the internet to a viewer.  But that's impracticable as a business model. 
Milo also said this, just a few minutes after the priest conversation in the same video:\n\n>“I am guessing, I haven’t told this publicly … we are talking 13 – 25, 13 – 28. These things happen perfectly consensually. Often by the way it is the women who suffer.”\n\n>[“What normally happens in schools very often is older woman with this younger boy. And the boy the predator in that situation. The boy is like let us see if I can fuck the hot gym teacher or the maths teacher. And he does. The women fall in love with these nubile  young men, these athletic young boys in their prime. And end up having their lives destroyed. They end up having to move schools, move the country, whatever. I would say, that situation I am describing on Joe Rogan show I was very definitely a predator on both occasions. As offensive as some people would find that I don’t much care. That was certainly my experience.”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azC1nm85btY&t=59m12s)\n\nwhich I find worse than his saying he doesn't feel damaged by his personal experience being fucked by a 30-year-old Catholic priest when he was 13.
> I don't want kids, won't want kids, and I should be able to make that decision as an adult\n\nYou can make that decision; in fact, you have already made the decision. That's fine.  What you really want, apparently, is the ability to compel a surgeon to remove your uterus.  Which is, of course, not a right and shouldn't be a right.  A surgeon is entitled to refuse to perform a hysterectomy on you for any reason or no reason at all.
I mean, civil engineers aren't shitty or anything, but their area of expertise is basically a subset of mechanical engineering.

> they are never prescribed or recommended for this purpose any more\n\nCodeine cough syrup is sold OTC in Canada and in some US drugstores (probably can't buy it at CVS, but if you live in a small town and have known the pharmacist your whole life there's a reasonable chance he will sell it to you).
> Also, when you consider the time it takes to travel to the airport, get through security, then get through customs at your destination and travel to your hotel/home, the time saved on the actual flight doesn't make any real difference as the majority of the day is already used up. \n\nMaking a NYC-London trip in 3:30 instead of ~8 hours is a big benefit for business travelers.  It means you can fly in on a 6 AM flight, make a 3:00 pm meeting, and potentially return same day.  A lot of businesses also have internal travel rules where travelers are allowed a recovery day for flights over about 8 hours.  Shortening a lot of the long routes removes that expense.
How about you provide even one state where telling someone to kill themselves is a specific crime and not just harassment.
It's not good policy to combine Latin and Greek letters in the same word.
> You could generate power using the pressure differential to generate flow, harnessing with turbines. A variation on the hydroelectric damn except with gravity building pressure in deep oceans to be released in a geyser-like construction, releasing the water pressure upwards at lower depths.\n\nWhat *exactly* is your concept here? Are you just building a pipe filled with water and putting it vertically in the ocean? Do you understand why that wouldn't work?\n\n
> Add it all up and combine my usage, before tax, it's about $.23/kWh. Fuck UPPCO. The only place that pays more than us in the US is Hawaii.\n\nPretty much all of the Boston area also pays about 20 cents/kWH. On my last electric bill I paid 9.6c/kWH generation charge and 10.5c/kWH distribution charge.

> I meant was that I'm sure my son would have adequate space and would enjoy the unique fun of a tiny home \n\nHow can you possibly know for a fact that your son would have what he considers adequate space in a tiny home and enjoy the "unique fun of a tiny home" when he doesn't even exist yet?
Culturally speaking it's not unusual for teenagers to start having sex by age 14 or so and it **is** unusual not to have sex until age 20. 
[Nice quote from a massive piece of spam that was sent to Podesta.](https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/40193)\n\nYou know, when you try to put quotes like these in the mouths of people who didn't say them, that's what some might call fake news.
> Just because there hasn’t been a problem with boys’ prom outfits in the past, doesn’t mean there couldn’t be in the future. It doesn’t justify a blatantly sexist policy.\n\nRepeatedly having trouble with girls' outfits justifies scrutiny of girls' outfits; having no trouble with boys' outfits does not justify scrutiny of boys' outfits. This is like saying it's racist to have a larger police presence in high-crime areas if it's true that those areas are majority minority.  \n\n>You asked what the difference was between people having their pictures taken at prom, and the girls being asked to submit full-body photos of themselves for approval beforehand. I answered your question.\n\nI didn't respond to that part because we're just going to have to agree to disagree on whether having to submit photos of dresses a girl wants to wear to prom is creepy. I don't think that it's creepy to have an administrator look at a photo of clothing someone is willing to wear to a function the administrator is likely to attend.
Of course they don't give a shit about Milo. But they don't have to, because they give a shit about free speech. The defend Nazis for the same reason. It's not a slam against them to say they don't like Milo; in fact it makes their defense of his rights more impressive.
No shit it is someone in a very high position, that's how they have info to leak. This sort of shit is vague enough that everything that happens will be seen as vindicating the OP. It's like how psychics bullshit people into thinking they can talk to the dead.
Milo can say he wasn't traumatized by being fucked by a much older man when he was 13.  No one else can tell him that he was.\n\nBut he also said this:\n\n\n>[“What normally happens in schools very often is older woman with this younger boy. And the boy the predator in that situation. The boy is like let us see if I can fuck the hot gym teacher or the maths teacher. And he does. The women fall in love with these nubile  young men, these athletic young boys in their prime.

>Question: if one pays the minimum due monthly, why is there an interest charge?\n\nBecause "minimum due" doesn't mean "minimum due to not pay interest", it means "minimum due so that you don't default on your debt to the credit card company".  If you don't want to pay interest you need to pay the statement balance.\n\n>2: what can I do to avoid future interest charges?\n\nEvery time you get a statement, pay the statement balance by the due date on the statement.  If you always do this you will never pay interest.\n
>  I grew up lower middle class with 5 siblings + 2 sets of grandparents all living in the same house and I personally never felt that I didn't have enough space to myself.\n\nSo 11 people in a house, with the caveat that 6 of the people were paired off - so the "ideal" would be 8 bedrooms.  How big was the house? If you put 3 people in a 300 ft tiny house you only have 100 sq ft per person.  I would be surprised if you really crammed 11 people into a house smaller than 1100 sq ft (which would be a 1 or 2 bed by modern standards and a 3 bed by '70s standards). If everyone in your house doubled up, with one set of people tripling up, you still would have needed 5 bedrooms. That would be a pretty big house, probably at least 2200 sq ft. By the way, a standard house in the '70s was about 1500 sq feet for a standard household size of 3 - so 500 sq ft per person. If your cramped house was 2200 sq ft, that would be 200 sq ft per person - still twice as much as three people in a 300 sq ft tiny house.\n\n>Was I envious of kids that had their own rooms and space? Sure, but that was from a materialistic standpoint.\n\nWhat does it matter *why* you were jealous of kids who had their own rooms? What does "from a materialistic standpoint" even mean? Of course it was from a materialistic standpoint because bedrooms are material goods.

> Ok, so if his or her entire cabinet is compromised, do they have to have a separate impeachment process for each member one by one and go down the line? \n\nYes.\n\n>Or is there a eject government button (not a literal button, just liked how that sounded) they can hit that just removes the entire cabinet from power? \n\nIf there is anyone in the order of succession who can be trusted to act as President, then they can just remove officers until they get to that person, and that person can fire the rest once they become President.  Otherwise, yes, the entire order of succession would have to be removed one by one.
> Difference 1: Only the girls are required to send in photos for approval.\n> \n\nThat's because I can guarantee they have never had a problem with a guy wearing something they would consider "too revealing" to prom. Because there is a single "guy uniform" and it's not at all revealing.
>  but I know more and more women who are the primary or equal breadwinner in their relationship.\n\nNot a surprise, as young women are better-educated than young men are (and have been since the '80s).

I'm so glad that you managed to escape and stay away.  You absolutely did the right thing in not even letting your ex know the city where you went.  If that guy is willing to dump cold water on a 4-year-old I shudder to think what else he would do.  Don't worry about your son being upset and acting out. It's only natural when you had to change his whole life.  Fortunately, he's so young that he might not even remember this in a few years.  \n\n I know you're having a tough time getting set up economically, and that sucks, but things will ease up.  Your son is turning 5 this year, right? Hopefully your state/city does all-day kindergarten.  That should free up time during the day for you to work. In the meantime, do you need any help locating resources like food banks in your area? Please don't feel ashamed if you take advantage.  There is no one out there who donates to a food bank that wouldn't be thrilled to hear they are helping a single mom with a young son get away from an abusive ex. No one.  If you need help locating those resources and you don't feel comfortable giving out more information online, that's fine.  Your son's principal ought to be able to put you in touch with food banks and other stuff like clothing and school supplies donations, etc. I remember when I was in school we had a Secret Santa type event every year, where needy families would make a list of things they wanted/needed for Christmas and they would be matched to people who would volunteer to donate whatever they could afford.  And it was all totally anonymous (unless the recipient wanted to disclose their identity) so no one got teased for being poor on that account. \n\nRemember that as a low-income single mother raising a child you're eligible for pretty much every aid program out there. [Check out benefits.gov and search for the info on where to apply in your area.](https://www.benefits.gov/) If your child is still 4, you're still eligible for WIC until he turns 5.  You can apply and if your child is nutritionally at risk (a physician will check this for free) you will be able to get vouchers that allow you to buy a lot of staple foods at no cost to you. \n\nHave you done your taxes yet? You are almost certain to be eligible for the Earned Income Tax Credit.  You will probably get several hundred, if not several thousand, dollars worth of EITC money back from the IRS even if your income is so low you didn't have any income tax liability at all.  If you need help doing your taxes, the IRS has a free program [where you can get help from IRS-trained volunteers.](https://www.irs.gov/individuals/free-tax-return-preparation-for-you-by-volunteers)  If you prefer, you can do it online [through the IRS's Free File program.](https://www.irs.gov/uac/free-file-do-your-federal-taxes-for-free) This lets you use commercial tax software like TurboTax or H&R Block absolutely free. Unfortunately, the Obamacare open season ended just a few days ago, so it might be tough for you to get a subsidized health insurance plan in the near future.  And who knows what will happen with the Trump administration.  He claims he will repeal it and replace it with something better, but I'm not sure it will work out that way.
By law that sort of thing can only stay on your credit report for seven years.
> I've used other examples in this thread, but consider access to the internet - I get pretty much the same content regardless of what I use to do it.\n\nYou get the same content, yes, which is a consequence of net neutrality.  That means that if you're lucky enough to be in a place with more than 1 ISP, they compete on things like reliability of service, cost, and speed.  But there's very little for streaming services to compete on if they all have access to the same media under some sort of mandatory licensing scheme.  If it were run like radio, Netflix, Hulu, Amazon Prime, etc. would all have the exact same library and pay the exact same amount of money on their end.  How would they distinguish themselves from their competitors? Just on price?

It is not true that the President has as many rights as a private citizen to make and destroy tweets or other documents at will, because the official documents the President generates are property of the United States, not of the President.
If the utility is required to allow you to hook up to the grid at any time, it's only fair that you should have to pay for the maintenance of the grid, whether you're hooked up to it at any particular time or not.

Well, the right to vote is the most fundamental right in a representative government whereas there is no right to buy canned air, so it's more important to make sure everyone entitled to vote is allowed to exercise that right than to make sure that people can buy canned air.

As the map you posted shows, the only direct access from a bus line with any other stops in Somerville is the 90.  That's pretty shoddy access. Just take a look at Davis for example, there are 6 bus lines with Davis stops that go to a wide variety of places in Somerville. Assembly has 1, and it's actually a stub line that terminates at Sullivan meaning even though it's the same line you have to switch busses to take the rest of the line out to Davis.

If there is a mechanism by which you and the utility can mutually agree that your property is not now and will never be entitled to utility service, then I see no reason why you should be obligated to pay.  But that situation is incredibly unlikely, because public utilities are generally obligated to provide service to parcels in their service area.\n\nBasically the problem is that even if you decide *you* don't want utility services, the utility still has to have enough money and infrastructure to provide services to your property, because at any time you could sell your property and someone who doesn't want to go off the grid could move in.  Depending on the regulatory structure, the utility may or may not be able to recover the entire cost of installation from the property owner.

This just in The Blaze owner Glenn Beck may have supported pedophilia says our anonymous sources. We can't prove it happened, but more importantly we cannot disprove it. More to come.
If you were Assange right now. Would you do the following after the election:\n\n1. Continue as normal dumping high profile damaging leaks on an administration that has threatened your life repeatedly.\n2. Constantly make yourself available to the public when multiple administrations have a death wish on you.\n3. Both 1 and 2 when the current US administration has been defeated partially thanks to wikileaks and will lose power soon. Knowing they have nothing to lose now and will act on anything they can before losing control.\n4. Sit quietly for 90 days with more damaging evidence and wait until the new Administration is in charge. 
Ok that made me laugh. He would be the Ed McMan .. just one word responses. "Shameful", "Unamerican", "disgraceful"

Perhaps this is why the families at the consulat in Istanbul were ask to leave?
Pull up his 5 point plan for reform, print it. Tell them it's from Hillary, ask them how they feel about it. Then flip it on its head and say it's actually from Trump.
I really hope they get the photos, unfortunately our society is photo and video hungry. Too lazy to read.

Omg tears starting

I agree. Something with upvotes on debunked posts. Let's be better than click bait posts, other sub reddits, and the media. 
Can't get enough of Cruz memes. This Sunday is the perfect blend of fact checkers, motivators, researchers, and shitposters 
That's the first part, of those 9200 they took a sample of 200, and 185 of those 200 had actually voted. That's a good sample size and enough I think to start a full investigation.

Ahem....FRENCH vanilla?
Correct response. 
It won't load anymore. Imgur is worse than North Korean propaganda.
BLONDES MAN
Most clever. 
That look of pride in Le Pen's eyes. That's a look anyone would be thankful to get 
Clicking on it won't load, but opening link in incognito mode loads just fine. Very strange...
I'm sorry (I'm not). The immeasureable levels of hotness would be too much! 
Am I in love? 
You spelled "President Trump's daughter and President Le Pen's niece" wrong
These ladies are what i imagine the french look like... 
"The future is female" 
eh, she's cute but not "smoking hot".  Ivanka... THAT's HOT
Only other peoples children. 
My Frank ... furter
Dont you mean "Nice"?
This and more this. Just c/p into a new tab and it works.  \n\nFUCK YOU, REDDIT.
**AIRHORN**
Ivanka and Le Pen's Niece will be the French Connection in 2024
So a three way with them wouldn't be quite so weird
Just tried it, and yeah, imgur is censoring us.
I'm experiencing the same. If you access imgur through T_D it gives you an error. If you copy paste that same URL into a new window it works fine.\n\nWeren't we trying to make an effort to use sli.mg instead of imgur?
I always knew :)

A bit cringey with the title. Isn't that her niece not her daughter?
I'd love to eat her box 
the right certainly has the best looking based babes
Another post is stating Imgur is doing that to all T_D linked images. If you copy the URL in a new tab it will open. \n\nLiberal tolerance at work again.

This is what I have been getting for the last hour when trying to view this pic:\n\nhttp://imgur.com/a/RcxsA\n\nWhen going directly to imgur all is well, only trying to get a pic of the Le pen's creates that mess?  WTF?
Not daughter, but niece,
Wow. Awesome speech.
#Pizzagate Confirmed!
Always whether it's deviant or not! They rather get praised for helping  other people's kids than help their own. 
Mine is a Jewish, married First Daughter. I STILL HAVE A CHANCE
The English have the pound.  But these two can have my franc.
Seriously I babysat for enough of them when I was a kid, they all have dirty homes with inappropriate shit all around & spoke to their kids so friggin creepy!

That name is a mouthful.
Mmmmmmm...
Smells like French Vanilla. 
nice niece
They are disgusted by the color of their childrens' skin
That's ok, she isn't

Uh.. both hot..

Yeah this is getting a little ridiculous.

goddamnit. \nSORRY PEDES\n#FAKE NEWS\n\nREEEEEEEEE
They're both beautiful 
What the fuck is wrong with imgur? Broken at every turn.
Nicccceeeee
I understand that, sure. But that train of logic leads to arranged marriage. Here, women marry the guys who fuck rights and make the funnys, and the $$. Wait.... they tricked us.... lol
I just donated all my shekels!\n\n#MATCH ME!
That's my problem with modern marriage. We've strayed too far from its roots. I mean, can anyone even rightly *think* their marriage is meaningful if it *doesn't* secure an alliance with a rival fiefdom? Does a marriage even count if you can't use it to sire an heir with a claim to the throne of the neighboring kingdom? Marriage used to mean something, and that "something" was a tool used to gain power and prevent wars. Now it's all about love. And love, last I checked, at least, can't be used to gain the throne of France.
Damn, very impressive speech!
sorry 16 year *long* bone ;)
Statistically speaking people with conservative values are more attractive than liberals. https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2017/01/conservatives-liberals-trump/512987/
Beauuuuuutiful
I'm right in between, just right...\n\nWait, that came out... Too right. I wish :D
Niece, but you can definitely see the resemblance. 
Imgur is blocking it.
Hey Takei, get out of here
Marine is running for president, she's old. Marion is not running for president, she's young. Marion is Marine's niece. That's all anyone needs to know to at the very least pretend they're following along. 
well played
Too bad they're against gay marriage 
Very odd; the link leads me to a page saying Imgur overloaded, try again later. \n\nFor fun I type in imgur.com and have no problems at all surfing 50+ pictures at the same time. \n\nAnd this link still wont work.
Bae
try copy the URL into another browser / don't get linked straight from here. it will work then. \n\nyes, i know, it's more anti-T_D fuckery. no suprise there
I respectfully disagree (about Marion, not about Ivanka).
>imagine a 16 year bone....\n\ncareful w/ that phrasing.
Lavender! 
And also smoking hot.
Le Pen Croissant 🥐!! Yummy!
heheh,  no prob.  just want to <wait for it....> CORRECT THE RECORD.\n\nYou're right that she's smoking hot tho.
Her niece :)
This comment thread needs to be higher. Blatant censorship for questionable reasons.
##I'm holding you to hire standard than CNN.
They're both very attractive
Marine is hot af in her own right; MILFy
Smoking hot \n\nBrick me
hide yo wifes hide yo kids!
A better chance then bernie. Believe me.
DAE smell vanilla?
They're both pretty hot.  But I'm getting old.

Imgur is fucking with us. Most of the time if you click on something hosted on imgur from /r/the_donald you'll get an "overloaded" error message but if you copy and paste the link in your address bar it works fine.
I don't appreciate "experience". I know I don't. \n\nHow about relatively old compared to her niece. One is visibly older than the other.
They're both attractive. 
I would pound both of them. 
based genes
Stop using imgur.  They quarantine this sub because leftism can't survive exposure to criticism.
😍😍😍\n\n
Same for me.
They can have my Richard...
Been doing that on every Le Pen post for me too.  I think she has become very poplar since refusing the hijab yesterday.
If only we could marry them off and forge an alliance like ye older knight times.
Marion Jeanne Caroline Maréchal-Le Pen. [She's based](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_PSYCyN4UI).
Europeans were once great brawlers. Now mostly just beta cucks. 
Breed them and create a ruling race of supreme human beings.\n\nno, scrap that. I think that idea didn't work out last time.
If you consider Marine "old" you are simply not old enough to *really* appreciate "experience".
Elect me like one of your French girls
No I didn't 
If they need some new york support I'll kiss every inch of either one of them
What kind of idiot doesn't place a smart, French blonde into their list of potential dream girls? Does no one plan ahead? 
That is an immaculately shaped lady.
Trump owns beauty pageants, it's only right that he should follow his presidency with models 
The parallels to Trump are amazing 
It worked out just fine.  It was called Europe.  But their descendants had to go full cuck and fuck it all up.
Supremely underrated comment!
Source of that information?
I'm from the time when we called a really good play a 3k elo play. I feel old.
Nice PvE game we got here.
The other teams are glad too, now that they have a chance to win the tourney.
We don't need to focus on the matchup. We're not the ones playing the games.. we're the viewers and gossip is all we got.\n\nI say let the accusing/excusing continue. Love me some spicy reddit drama.
Roller coaster > Airplane.
What's the origin of 'boosted animal' meme? Interested to know.
Too bad for you that Riot is an NA company so they give their region priority over your slimy region (and also the fact that it makes them the most money) Maybe you people should make your own game and start playing it or quit being elitist over the so-called competitiveness of your regions.
Calling someone a 'fag' as an insult in 2016? You sure restore my faith in humanity.
(G)2-8 never forget.
Why do you think it's your responsibility as an EU resident to make people of other regions happy about the performance of teams in your region? Don't you think it's the responsibility of the players to react to it/do something about it?\n\nYou don't have to take anything personally, really. You don't represent EU, LCS teams and players do.
Nice try McRee.
His name is Zarya Stark.
NukeDuck? More like NoobDuck.
He absorbed some of Faker's powers after getting to play against him in solo queue.
Kikis CS and overall performance is embarrassing.
Monte can be an obnoxious little clown and laugh all he wants. In the end all that matters is that Forg1ven won and Deft lost.
Like he insulted YS?
Now kiss.
Then Darien proceeds to play mid lane with just one hand.
Faker 1v9 this game. Truly stuck in elo hell.
It's time to FF-natic.
I know what you're trying to say but their work literally is a game.
I'd like it to be *bad meming*.
Rito pls, we want the botlane stream. Even Doa/Monte didn't sound as good today after my experience with Krepo, Mithy and Zven's hilarious yet insightful commentary. \n\nI'm spoiled. -_-
How come this thread is so empty? Is there another more active one?
Fnatic having a close series with a bottom two contender team doesn't really bode well for them.
They "throw a lot". You got that part right!
Hilarious how he fucks George over then proceeds to lose his train of thought.
That's what happens when you recruit washed up pros like Soaz/Amazing and an LCS reject like Jesiz. GL with your LCS ambitions Fnatic.
It may be entertaining to watch for most viewers, but it's a clown feista in every sense of the word. There's hardly any strategy involved. Just solo queue level team fights everywhere.
Parth gulps a lot when speaking to the team. A sign of someone who gets nervous when public speaking.
**WALL**
What about green ward. Still stuck in Bronze? (would be ironic because no one buys wards in Bronze)
He forgot to add he was the best midlaner when he played mid. /s
How can any team even think of beating this year's SKT. They make everything seem so effortless (way too much talent together in a team) They're gonna be S7 champs ezpz.
And a penis.
Happened to me live when I was playing Torbjorn with a turret on the point but no enemies got in its shooting range for quite a few minutes. The game kicked me for inactivity. I was really pissed but what can you do.
I'd pay to watch a Koreans vs world championship level bots match. It'd be probably the only time west can beat korea.
Rekkles does nothing but pussyfoot at the outskirts of the fights. The guy must be really tilted.
Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice, shame on me (how Fnatic hid in Ivern bush to catch Roccat TWICE)
Should have been fourth but oh well.
More like drop the biggest load League has ever seen.
G2 got outdrafted hard. I don't see them winning this.
For a sec I thought Google Nexus started exploding too after taking inspiration from the Galaxy Note 7.
Sorry bot, but you got outplayed this time.
The difference in this vs EU is unreal. It probably cost many thousands of dollars to make, while EU one is clearly a low budget video that they just put together in-house for no more than a hundred bucks.
Nice start by CLG but I have a feeling Huhi will fuck it up for his team somehow.
Bible thumper BTFO.
I'm still confused. Can you rephrase?
I've alway thought ESO's graphics are just average. GW2 looks more mature graphics wise and it was released years ago. Dunno maybe just me.
CLG has evolved into a world class team in this tourney. Darshan, Stixxay and even Huhi are making beautiful plays this game. FW stands no chance.
A certain gold 4 brand solo killing Faker comes to mind.
Only Duke seemed overly happy but that's probably because he's a rookie and it's a big deal for him.
Someone is soon going to get kick-ied from Fnatic.
It's OK, I'll be your ~~history~~ meme teacher.
[Sorry Loco, but you can't beat the destiny](https://twitter.com/Locodoco/status/718842966823993344)
I still don't get what "die <-- this one" means.
Riot is based in America so I'd say its west.
Our lord and savior Kobe even casts the game that he doesn't cast. Now wrap your head around that.
4 regular sized boobs and 1 D-cup.
We do: https://discord.gg/0hRQ0QjZ6iWgGZkU
Duke is clearly a downgrade from Marin.
Not gonna lie Jensen. That was a boosted ult.
Overly Photoshopped. And so are the rest of the portraits of all players of every team.
This actually can be a valid strategy in pro games.
Not gonna lie, after watching LCK final today, this feels like high school football.
Source on this? Just wondering.
Faker flashed to Nami so she could heal him, but instead Nami just threw a bubble at him. KR clownfiesta right there.
Why is it starting earlier today? Not that I'm complaining. I can finally catch more than one games live today. Yay!
That's one outdated design and UI. Twitch and Youtube are godlike compared to that.
Bot lane stream is hilarious and awesome for not being politically correct and not shying away from calling a spade a spade, as compared to the main stream which seems like a watered down and disney version of this stream.\n\nRito pls, we want more streams like this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XnG8QgkcAdA
H2K got the luckiest quarterfinals. The 2nd one would be SKT vs C9. Who knows what would have happened if they got a Korean team in quarterfinals!
I'd say that he's gone completely banana.
The ~~north~~ China remembers.
It's insane how high quality the plays are in this game. I'm truly entertained.
EU mids man! Caps schooling Perkz on how to play League of Legends.
It has been an honor watching top kik-is.
Great to know. I've watched that stream many times myself and there's absolutely nothing about it that warrants getting banned. Player names and in-game chat is hidden, so absolutely no way of knowing who's playing and what're they saying. All in all, it's just a stream of bronze plays and clown-fiestas of unknown players, which some viewers find very entertaining to watch. Nothing wrong about that.
"We"? Just a reminder that you're not SKT, just a random SKT fan. Saying "the team I support" would make 10x more sense.
Ah, now kith.
They weren't rejected in LCK but whatever floats your boat.
*Shitting rains from above*
Good old toxic ~~tyler1~~ Forg1ven.
You loyal.
Kobe's commentary makes it eve funnier though "Its like he's paying his soldiers half wage. So, they're like ehh we won't go the full distance, only half distance"
Gotta give it to Faker. He was amazing even on a losing team. Sadly, 1v9 just doesn't work at this level.
FW got to quarter finals because CLG couldn't. DUH. Also, they lost to PNG. Nuff said.
A pathological liar too on top of that. I remember once when he was streaming a team game and made a call for a teamfight, which went horribly wrong, he started outright denying that he made any sort of call and instead blamed someone on the team for making the wrong call. And it's not the only moment at all. He usually was toxic towards his own team and lied a lot. He certainly has a good relationship with Steve because when he played, he got his team members kicked all the time. And when he retired he's been coaching on and off.
A few weeks feel like 6 years. Have I lost my sense of time?
I would add some but I lost my train of thoughts.
jiji means long penis in Chinese. Just saying.
Sheldon Cooper is that you?
So no chance for him if he's a guy? Sad world.
CLG back to its usual level?
So basically whoever gets Taliyah, wins. This champ is just broken.
And the rest just penis rides the pros no matter what they do.
CLG was winning when I went to washroom to answer nature's call. Came back after 5 minutes and CLG had lost. What the actual fuck!
"They"? It's just a Facebook post by a random nobody with just 1 like for christ's sake. Stop creating unnecessary hysteria.
This is conspiracy changes level stuff.

He doesn't get much exercise. \n\nLife of a rich kid... Near 1000$ jacket at no more than 22. I have a 1000$ suit at 35 for big business meetings and I treat it like gold. Hes out rioting with it, no sense at all. Never earned money so it means nothing to him.\n\nSorry to be verbose, I'm just disgusted with this.
Scott Foval is talking about rigging the vote, using shell companies to lend cars to people to vote illegally in Illinois, and his plans to grow the scheme nationally in Republican states to gain control of the elections. He recommends using this plan in the general elections.

Because pink a blue have been an easy way to indicate the sex of a child from birth for generations. But hey, seeing as were destroying everything in society that women in pink is awful, sexist, hetero normative, racist, and oppressive to people of color.

What would this army do globally? What conflicts would it engage in? With the support of how many member "STATES" of the EU? Would it be deployed within the borders of the EU in times of unrest?\n\nThe problem with a border-less army and an unaccountable politico in another country must be examined. This has never been done before, and as with most EU policies is near impossible to undo.
This is how it ends.
I do remember he said that was an opening point for negotiation. I know you don't go into a negotiation and ask for exactly what you want. It leaves you with no wiggle room.

This is hilarious.
Red pill has become a popular phrase among cyberculture and signifies a free-thinking attitude, and a waking up from a "normal" life of sloth and ignorance. Red pills prefer the truth, no matter how gritty and painful it may be.
Yeah, you got it buddy. If there's no contact there's no problem. Lets try to recreate that scene. I'll drive.
I'm sorry to hear about your story. Clearly Heath care is not as much of a priority for our government as it should be. I'm sitting here with now more than 100 people approaching 5 hours and I have not seen anyone. Nor have other sick people that need help, this is really not the way the system was envisioned.
Very disturbing.
I hope this isn't that Hillary being enraged against a black person video we were hearing about "that will destroy Hillary" because that wont cut it.
You glorious bastards. That image is number 3 when I search side of beef in google images.
I might be casting too bright a light on this, but I read his use of safe space as tongue in cheek. At least, that's how I'd be writing that tweet.

Humanity aside, its a smart strategy. I must assume this area is controlled by IS, or another faction that they do not like. If there is no water the populace is unhappy because of the lack of clean water and other basic necessities, the rule of this group is currently in jeopardy. Furthermore, when people remember their rule later, it will be much less of a rosy picture.
Like in the EU, right?
You might be sick of some speech that others aren't. IE A tumblerina that hears white men aren't the devil.\n\nMuting any speech is dangerous. If you mute only hate speech, who decides what hate speech is? \n\nThe slippery slope into conservatism or right wing politics being hate speech is right in front of you. Look to Europe RIGHT NOW to see all forms of expression slipping into the hate speech definition to quell dissent.\n\nIt is very dangerous and totalitarian to say "You're not allowed to say that" to anybody. Especially when it comes from the government. 
If people are going to die, grab the persons adams apple (larynx) push inwards and pull to one side or the other. You're playing for keeps so make it the most strong push and pull you've ever done.

>  6 dead Canadians\n\nI am deeply saddened that anybody would cause such pain so close to my home. Innocent peoples families are destroyed because of this barbarian. \n\nWith that being said, this incident will be used to excuse the next 200 terrorist attacks in the world perpetrated by Islamic extremists just as Dyllan Roof has been used for the last 200.\n\nWe should be fighting and clawing for solutions, and instead we're just pointing fingers. There is little that can be done with zealots on both sides, and both must be dealt with. In reality however you cant deny that there is a disparity in the body count.
Its funny, they had to know the hypocrisy would shine through. Its like they want both sides to be talking about it, and henceforth have people talk about their brand, and sell a product.
I don't want to dismiss someone's ideas due to their weight, so know that I hate his politics and as a side note his legs are fu*king disgusting.\n\nPS: if you had legs like that would you sit spread eagle in shorts? No shame.

Its off urban dictionary. What definition are you shopping for today sir? \n\nSadly, the oxford dictionary doesn't mention it. Why don't you write your own definition on a piece of paper and frame it on your wall?
The best part is the twat telling him that he deserved that for his political views. Its true what Shapiro says, their minds are so warped by academia they think free speech is hate speech and an appropriate response is violence.

An MRAP is a defensive vehicle. "[It] was acquired for free for rescue missions at schools under siege". They removed it because the community wasn't comfortable with an ex army armored vehicle.\n\nWhats funny about being proactive? This stuff is free from the military (minus maintenance) and helps save lives.\n\n-Furthermore, they listen to the citizens and remove the vehicle because the are uncomfortable with it. Much better than on the federal level.
"Two police officers wearing hijabs in London"\n\nThere's something wrong with this. I know we're supposed to like diversity at penalty of racism, but the west isn't supposed to have officers in burkas.

Here is a list of >320,000 directives that EU member states must achieve by whatever means available. \n\nIn brief, sometimes member states get to argue the merits of these laws and draft them.

Your analogy implies you're prey.
Here is what happens with people like this:\n\nYou make a reasoned argument for your position. This takes some time and thinking. The person looks for undeveloped parts of your argument which are self evident on face value. They (mis)quote it and beg the question to attempt to win their argument. It takes all of 30 seconds to make his slanderous reply, and he attempts to muddy the waters by introducing unstated biases.\n\nI say he "ended up getting shot while running away" knowing full well that alone is not enough of a reason to be shot. He knows this, but its a doorway to slander me. Then you reply with the argument that they didn't know whether they were still in danger or not (WHICH IS SELF EVIDENT BY WATCHING THE VIDEO). He completely ignores your argument and quote-mines you as well.\n\nChrist, I was sure the gunfire was going both ways and he was armed until I came to find out different here.\n\nThis guy is either disingenuous, terribly biased, or an idiot. 
Cut mine in two. Coat's on back-order apparently. Too high energy for the factory :P
I'm nervous as a Trump supporter. But I would feel just as nervous with Hillary in office. The saber rattling was getting rather intense with Russia. \n\nTruth is, its a little soon to know how things are going to play out in the first year. If Trump outright lied on most issues like other politicians, I would expect a migration back to the left. A non-inconsequential number of Trump supporters were Obama supporters, myself included.
CBC is trash. Nobody is watching. One day taxpayers wont be able or willing to pay for welfare for them, and their assets will be bought up by real profitable news outlets for pennies.
Hahahaha this is the time that they will stop him. The other 3 videos were just mulligans.
Frankly, the UN is more or less a joke. What will happen if they don't abide by their ruling? Nothing. \n\nYou think they would attempt political or economic sanctions on a G8 [(+5-1) <-lol] nation?
Downvotes don't bother me. Thanks though.
That number.. kek is real.
Operator as fuck.
I love that these far left people are always willing to sell out.
Canada of all places, not to get too specific. There's stuff going on all around you all the time that you probably don't know about, no matter where you are.\n\nI was stabbed with a bottle once. I went to the hospital with an induced coma for 2 days (not too bad, relatively) when I was attacked from behind with a heavy wooden chair. I've had a gun pulled on me too, thankfully I was with someone and we were able to wrestle it from him. It wasn't loaded.\n\nFrom the videos I've seen I'd be dead in Brazil.
http://finance.yahoo.com/news/trump-administration-frozen-obama-quiet-195211333.html\n\nIts real.
Please give me cogent arguments on why abortions have to be subsidized by tax dollars. \n\nTo be clear not an argument on why they should be legal, as I am  pro-choice. \n\nI would like to understand the argument, and will read intently but not reply because I don't want to argue; I want to hear your side.
What I read is apparently the perp is still being held, but will face retrial due to not understanding what "no" meant. I echo your sentiments but I'd like to make that statement clear.
I find it odd that it's the people's fault for going to the hospital. I'm sure there are some outliers that go because they have a cold, but I assume the majority have serious concerns for their health. My situation is I have numbness in my hands and feet, lack of energy difficulty concentrating. Will I die due to that in the next 24 hours? No. Is it serious enough to be granted access to medical treatment? Who decides? You? Where else can I go today? I had an appointment with a clinic, and the doctor didn't even come in to work. 
lol, I knew there was a 75% chance it was fake from the start. More than half of the news is fake and everybody knows that now.
It has more to do with stoking the flames of a fire. The guy nearly ran down police officers and had no care for others lives, then ended up shot while running away. The title implies the police did something wrong and he was out going to the store for skittles and iced tea.\n\nIf it were worded hit and run, fleeing felon, it would be more accurate. The current title, if it exists as stated, is devoid of all context.\n\nIf I were to say a white man killed an Asian teen, and implicitly avoid mentioning this teen had a knife to his daughter's throat that statement would still be accurate on its own, but is stripped of all the relevant information as to the cause of the conflict.
The UN did a bunch of talking.. No action is taken as of yet.
The cameras used will often not be able to be on for an entire shift, so they are controlled by the officer. Technology will eventually enable them to be on for a very long period of time.\n\nCurrently, you can either have a very poor quality video all day long, or a 1080p+ high quality video when needed.

More bullshit. Nobody said he deserved to die. If he hadn't put himself in danger, by being a danger to others he would be alive right now. The blame lands on his head not mine.

So, you think that people will get castrated for having sex in the western world. Can you honestly believe that? There's no right answer to that question, but its you making these statements so you have to bear the consequences.\n\nStep back for a second, collect yourself, and realize this is a ridiculous argument. White people will always exist, but will be a minority almost everywhere in our lifetimes. We don't want to increase our population and welcome other races and ethnicities into our countries. Nobody else does that on earth. \n\nStop beating us down, it does not lift you up. Instead it makes us both look pretty stupid.

That's your opinion cuck.
I agree with the article. We should have a curfew for all men at night... except for the police, firemen, ambulance techs.. factory workers, power plant employees, security personnel, city works staff, plumbers, electricians, road workers, taxi drivers, garbage men, city inspectors, signal techs, long haul drivers, delivery men, snow removal crews... wait a minute, feminists take all this stuff for granted.
You can actually feel how afraid the prosecutor is of having riots in the article. Sad times.
Here's the thing: The UN depends on the cooperation of its members. The "EU Army" would in all inevitability be outside of the control of its members.
Seriously though, the definition though slightly imperfect conveys that it is an internet lingo signifying a paradigm shift  (a fundamental change in the basic concepts) in this case politically.\n\nWhat is wrong with this definition? I know you wont be happy with it.
I'm surprised people don't like being subtly called racist when buying coffee.

> How much is the product you wanted to buy?\n> It depends. A custom made software is always, all other conditions equal, more expensive that something canned.\n> What do you need, basically? It reads like these solutions do a lot of things.\n> PS: I don't do freelancing, so you can be candid.\n\n10,000$ Would be willing to pay 3, but looking for a solution for as low as possible. From what I've been researching in the last 3 hours the base of this software is a simple POS. With a bunch of modules that offer bar code scanning, "rapid POS", remote receipt printing, card processing, loyalty programs, dashboard, management, and reports. \n\nI could live with a program that can handle a fast POS, remote (bluetooth) printing, loyalty card processing and tracking (CRM), dash, and reporting.\n\nI suppose worst case I can even drop the remote printing.\n\nI'm pretty in the dark about programming and open source beyond contracting out the work.\n
I agree with everything, but I'm born here and my life is intertwined with everything.\n\nOtherwise the province is amazing, I love speaking French and the people. The night life is the best I've seen anywhere.\n\nThere are honestly less SWJs here than you would think. I've never met one from here, that I know of. I have met a lot of imports from other places going to school here. The type that will stop talking to you if you have different views on subjects ranging from small to large.\n\nThe problem we have is there is a culture of corruption and a culture of statism. The state is a nanny, and corrupt, and increasingly needs more and more revenue for pet projects, welfare, subsidized housing and the like. The more money they get, the more they start new projects.\n\nThey have regulated industries that did not want to or need to be regulated. They require companies that used to deal directly with the government to deal with private corporations at behest of the government for 2-4 times the "fees". Automobile dealers, security firms, etc. etc.\n\nAs Shapiro says, at the point of gun, they demand fees. If you don't pay for the local business associations fees they consider it the same as not paying taxes. It requires a minority vote to open these associations, and a 75% super majority to close them. Once open, they stay open.\n\nAs a complete coincidence, this is all happening in a Province with massive problems with politicians taking bribes.\n\nBasically we're governed like socialist Europe with an economy heading the way of true communism.
I'm no tough guy, but I managed bars for 10+ years mostly without security so I've dealt with the dredges of society, which was a small minority of my customers.\n\nMy view on it is that I didn't want to end up in one of these videos, so I would fight as dirty as possible when there was a chance I would lose.\n\nI've gouged many eyes in my life and I can tell you it immediately shuts down everybody. There is no fight left in people once you make their eye sockets bleed. People enter complete panic mode, and stop fighting. Its not bad advice; if you fear for your safety go for the eyes.\n\nAll you really have to do is put your finger in the side, and once you feel the eye nerves... stop. At that point they will give in immediately.\n\nHope that helps you feel comfortable about all of this.
> White guy here, 21,000 dollars in tax this year that's how much I paid in property, income, sales, and payroll taxes. But I'm the one who has to do better...\n\nHaha, don't come to Quebec. 40,000$ in Payroll tax, 42,000$ in municipal tax, 15 employees total during the year (peak 8, low 4), small business <1,000,000$ in sales.\n\nGood news is there's almost nothing left to tax for year end... @ 11.25% Federal, and 8.65% Provincial.\n\nFeels good knowing all my work is paying for 3 people on welfare annually, and I could make more money working at the corner store.\n\n(We're only open 1 year, 6 mo. Growing. But stifling taxes)
Saw this on Voat, curious what you think.
I read that too, but she said verbally that the grand muffy guy said it was not required.
Well, frankly that's not bad news, and it makes me feel slightly better. Its not undeniable proof that all is well, but its a start.
She's a comedian alright.

And we should be interested in her opinion because............?
Yes.\n\nRegardless of what you believe about climate change, you can be sure of this: All the solutions offered to combat it have nothing to do with actually combating it.  It's all about redistribution of wealth.  "Changing the economic model".  It's not a conspiracy.  It's all right there, in their own words.  It's an "acceptable" form of communism.\n\nYou know what Green parties/environmental groups are?  They're "Watermelon" parties - a thin shell of green, with a whole bunch of red underneath.\n\n
Yes, if for no other reason than it's universally understood better than liberal.
Sellout Sanders is the last person who should be challenging someone's authenticity.

Hmm.  Could have sworn I read something earlier in the week that claimed he was the front runner.  Maybe the author was trying to project and meme their preferred candidate into leadership.\n\nAnyways, it's an interesting tweet.
Only white heterosexual Christian males are capable of rape.  If anyone else does it, it is:\n\na) an expression of culture, and we shouldn't denigrate anyone else's culture\n\nOR \n\nb) they were driven to rape because they themselves are victims of some sort of vague and nebulous form of "oppression", perpetrated by evil white cis-hetero white males.\n\nThey'll deny that that is their thought process on the subject, but it is.  It's buried deep in their subconscious, deep in their psyche.  It is the natural outcome of an all-encompassing victim culture that permeates media, academia, and politics.
Interdasting
Does she have a family?
Very nice!
Two very interesting points that you bring up.  I too have ruminated on the subject and have attributed it to indoctrination as you mentioned, but never really considered epigenetics or any other biological/hereditary factors.\n\nThings like this need to be brought to light and discussed more often, because what appears to be happening is troubling to say the least.  I'm thousands of kilometers away, but from where I'm sitting it seems like a national identity/psyche that is built upon total self-annihilation.  Hopefully my impression of what is happening is just a cartoonish exaggeration.
That's a bit disconcerting.
that's fine.  his opinion is meaningless.  and congratulations to him on being a super bowl champion.

Embarrassingly weak leadership from the mayor and chief of police.  Berkeley is open for pillaging.
Delegitimization of the CORPORATE press.  The "press" isn't solely confined to being the mouthpiece for million and billion dollar multinational corporations.  Everytime you publish your idea for the world to see, whether digitially or the old-fashioned way, you are engaing in activities of the press.  Everytime you tweet, hit 'enter' on your keyboard, take ink to paper, hit 'record' on your camera etc. - you are engaging in activities of the press.  The 'press' as referred to in the First Amendment simply refers to the printing press, and now we all have many more ways to publish our thoughts and ideas.\n\nThe press =/= corporate news media.\n\nEvery American man, woman, and child is a member of the press.  "We the media now" is not just a meme, it's the truth.

There's a naive utopian streak that runs through libertarianism, unfortunately.

Happy to be part of history tonight. Thank you all for your hard work.
Just a theory about why they start the fires. \n\nThey start the fires to trigger people's emotions. It makes everything look dramatic, more shocking for pictures. If you took a picture of protesters all clean and sunshine in the background it wouldn't look as intense. You add smoke, fire, and gritty protesters and it starts looking more like a war zone. It plays on people's emotions. It's just another form of emotional manipulation. Make it look scary, dark and dangerous. \n\nThey have to make it look worse then it is. And make it look threatening to the passive observer or to spread their own propaganda. Sunshine and rainbows don't spread fear and that's why they need to create the fire and smoke.
Don't they do that every day while crying about white privilege?
Feed them some line like "Help spread the awearness by telling the undoccumunity to use #PROUDILLEGAL to speak out against Trump"

When my brother and I helped our dad put in a new hard wood floor we decided to have some fun writing on the floor we were covering up. We started off just writing some of our favorite quotes. One quoted I did was from penny arcade http://www.penny-arcade.com/comic/2006/04/10 \nThen we started to draw alchemy circles from full metal alchemist. Also since I'm a supernatural fan I also made a devils trap in front off the back and front doors and other symbols also. When we got done the floor looked like the writing and drawings of a mad man and our dad flipped out a bit when he saw what we did. We just laughed as we covered everything up with the new floor. 
Thank you all for your words of support. It helps in times like these. 
I do both. I'm a monster. I admit it.

Well the BernieCucks are still going strong a week after the DNC, so I'm going to say that /r/hillaryclinton will still be there at least until December after she loses.

Likely the admins were trying to implement some new code to suppress /r/the_donald from /r/all but they fucked it up and instead absolutely flooded it with Donald posts. They'll just go with it and claim reddit was hacked by a Trump supporter, use it as an excuse to ban the sub.\n\nThis almost sounds familiar, where have I heard this before.... Hillary... Russian hackers blamed for her own fuck up.... Promptly filed under "things that make you go hmmmm"
Why does this Jewish woman keep saying "we" in reference to white people?\n\nAnyways, these two are entirely unfunny and actually physically difficult to listen to. The woman's voice is shrill and annoying, and the man n-n-nee-needs t-t-to g-g-g-get o-o-over h-h-his s-s-st-st-stutter (I imagine he's become too used to sitting back and allowing his wife to dominate any social setting they're in).\n\nI didn't listen to the entire thing, but from what I heard, they're basically saying that whites are too thin skinned and are supposedly now calling for the same safe spaces that they have mocked recently. I don't think white people are calling for safe spaces, we've been putting up with this shit for a while now and have pretty much gotten used to it. We're just asking that if we are being given all of these new rules and social etiquette on never saying anything mean ever about a specific race, why doesn't this also apply to white people? Why is saying "genocide jews" a hate crime while saying "genocide white people" is a non-issue?\n\nI do love the fact that the left has now begun using the term "safe space" to insult us, though. In order to use that as an insult, they have to first acknowledge that the notion of safe spaces is ridiculous. It's just like implying that any homophobe must be a closeted homosexual as an insult, they're using "gay" as an insult.
In today's political climate where saying ["black hole"](http://www.foxnews.com/us/2010/06/11/naacp-urges-hallmark-pull-racist-card-shelves.html) is racist, I'd imagine it's difficult to find anybody who hasn't said something """racist""". What about the DNC staffers who referred to Hispanic voters as taco bowls?

> Trump won not because he was Not Hillary\n\nlol I thought the number one thing Hillary had over Trump was that she was "Not Trump."\n\nFace it. The people want Trump. Your horse lost.\n\nEdit: your horse**s** lost
It has been an unofficial quid pro quo for the presidents to allow a select press pool to hover over them at all times and get the newest breaking stories, and in return those journalists write favorable articles on that president. Trump already knows the media hates him, and he's not going to throw bones to dogs who have spent the past 18 months biting him. Trump has made it obvious he's not going to play by this system, so the journalists are screaming and crying.
>"Hey guys I'm going to throw blood on the wall and write in cryptic language and pose with goat skulls and use other satanic imagery"\n\n>"It's totally not *actually* satanic though, it's art!"\n\nIs this the "It's just a prank bro!" of the art world?
"Conspiracy theorist" was a phrase invented to discredit, mock, and belittle people with legitimate concerns and group them together with people who have true mental illnesses like schizophrenia. You wouldn't believe the number of people who disbelieve me when I bring up MKULTRA, yet the US government has actually admitted to performing illegal mind altering experiments on their own military/citizenship.
Clock boy Muhammad did something similar on 9/11. I don't remember the exact quote but it went something like this;\n\n>While we should all remember the three thousand Americans who died on this day, let's also remember the millions of **innocent** Muslims who died over the course of the resulting war.\n\nImplying the Americans in the towers weren't innocent.
We have seen time and time again that polls are largely unreliable; they're just propaganda tools to either pump up or demoralize voters. Many people on this sub have said that polls don't matter and I agree with them. There will always be ways for the pollsters to add bias into their data.\n\nIn my opinion, they've recently allowed Trump to surge in the polls to build him up. Then once the first debate rolls around, they'll destroy him in the polls in an attempt to say that Hillary beat him in the debate.
"Hey by my arbitrary rule set, you're a terrible person and I hate you."\n\n"Your arbitrary rule set means nothing to me."\n\n"LOL NICE DEFLECTION THERE, guess you can't prove you're a good person using my own set of arbitrary rules which a priori conclude you're a bad person."
Hahah why are Swedes such pussies?\n\nAnyways, go kill some monkeys you crazy BRs\n\nhttp://imgur.com/iIsDTjs
Probably. That or some cuck who can't stand behind the things he says. Too cowardly to face reality.
If you think the "law and order" candidate who wants to cut back on federal bureaucracy won't let states make their own laws and keep their own order then you don't understand what small government means.
I was talking specifically about character customization (although staying out of the fire isn't all that difficult either). You can't pick a bad stat, you can't pick a bad skill. Just as an example, it used to be that you'd have to find a balance between statting for magic resist and your other stats. When first starting out you'd lean more toward the resist, but once you became more experienced and your healers could handle it, you'd switch over to your main stats and you'd have to find a balance.\n\nPvP is the biggest cause of all the classes becoming the same. It used to be that only paladins had the bubble, but then hunters cried and they got deflection. So many other skills and abilities were either thrown out or given to everyone because of arena players.
"Don't sacrifice anything" is an exaggeration on your part, and of course the family members of servicemen can go about sacrificing in their own way. Having a family member in the military does not suddenly give you any special status. At least, according [to this US Marine vet](https://globalriskinfo.com/2016/07/31/an-open-letter-to-khizr-khan/), it doesn't.
Elliot Rodger. His name was Elliot Rodger. Nobody gives a fuck about some random redditor saying his name; you're not important enough to inspire someone else to copy him. I swear it's one of the most ridiculous things I've ever seen how redditors seem to believe that if the news would just "stop saying the name!!!!" then there would never be another shooting ever.
You would be correct, because I don't waste time jacking it to porn and pretending like I'm buddies with the women by being on their snapchat.\n\nAgain, porn stars are actresses. Her career is dependent upon seeming like a sex-loving nympho who is actually enjoying it. Nobody is going to watch her if it's obvious she hates life and cries at home every night. This snapchat you're talking about is all marketing, man. She faking a personal emotional connection with you so you'll buy more of her videos.
Hahah, you actually think that was an appeal to Hispanic voters?
HAH no. You go to bootcamp to get the pussy drilled out of you. Nobody gives a fuck if you start crying. In fact they'll beat you down even harder.
"German aggression".... When your strategy consists of "continuously throw meat into the grinder until a bone jams a gear" then you had better be prepared for massive casualties. I wonder how many of those millions of deaths were a result of the Russians' own political commissars.

Decent comic, but the TSA agent should have been a fat black lady.
Oh boy you sure got me, only the professionals doing progression mythic are allowed to have opinions! :\\^) Just like people who aren't NFL players aren't allowed to have opinions on who the best team is! Regardless, I'd wager a good number of them would agree with me.\n\n[Wrath is when things first started getting simplified, and it only got worse from there](https://www.downfallguild.org/image/view/7613/_original)
Being on /pol/ they call each other worse things all the time. People aren't so thin-skinned over there as they are here. "400 lb loser" wouldn't phase anybody.
There are sites like that. Using them takes a thick skin, no inflated ego, and no reliance upon snow-flake status in order to feel special. Most people get bored of it though because you can't accumulate internet points to show off and attention-whore.
>This is what I've observed.\n\nSo you're admitting that the only "evidence" you have is *anecdotal*.\n\nWell here are some anecdotes for you as well, which back up the reality which I have chosen to believe;\n\n[Belladonna crying on TV about how she doesn't like her life](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OBtLst3espU)\n\nShortly after doing a scene with BLACKED, porn star Alli Rae said that "getting into porn was the worst decision of my life."\n\nClaire Evans did all those Gloryhole Swallow videos and shortly after said that it is a disgusting industry and she regretted joining.\n\nAre you seriously, unironically, trying to state getting into porn would be a net benefit in most womens' lives? That there are more examples of women coming out of porn happy, than coming out of it destroyed and traumatized? That is such a ridiculously dangerous thing to say. Sure you have a few outliers like Bobbi Starr who are able to make their own personal porn companies and set their own rules, but in her case that was after years of extremely intense and degrading scenes. You saying that women getting into porn is "empowering" and "enjoyable" is like telling little kids that they can easily get into the NBA or NFL. Sure a few athletes do grow up to get into the big leagues like that, but the vast, VAST majority of them don't.\n\nFucking morons like you are the reason exploitation porn sites like Throated exist; because you fill women with this idea that getting into porn is some beautiful and empowering thing. So they desperately want to get in for the easy cash and to feel empowered, and they end up being choked until they vomit on some dude's dick.
>what's changed\n\nJust more of the same trend that's been going on since end of Wrath/Cata. Classes are being homogenized so that no one class really stands out, rotations are being simplified as they merge spells and remove class resources, stats are streamlined as now you pretty much only get Int/Str/Agi and one other "this helps everything" stat. Daily quests have been given steroids to the point where basically half the game is Farmville. Pretty much all of the budget has gone into art.
Yes I'm aware that it's a thing. First, just to clarify, the gold star is not awarded as any sort of valor medal, so don't mistake it for awards like the Bronze or Silver Stars. It's basically just a way for the military to say "Sorry 'bout your son, here's a ribbon so uhh could you send us more of your sons?"\n\nOn that note, if Khan is calling out Trump for supposedly not making such a huge sacrifice, why doesn't he call out Clinton? She has no children who served. Why not call out Obama? None of his kids are likely to serve. Why not call out the hundreds of millions of Americans who haven't made that sacrifice? Khan's whole speech was just an attempt at using his son for political posturing, with the hope that Trump wouldn't be able to say anything back since the son is dead and a vet. Similar to someone who insults you and then cries out "Hey you wouldn't hit a kid with glasses, would you?!?"
Something similar happened a few months ago. I don't remember exactly but some major news org was talking about Trump and there was just some passing mention of JFK so they showed him being shot on the background monitor. They didn't comment on the video at all, they just let the video play in the background and continued on talking about Trump.\n\nEdit: okay I found what I was thinking about. It was CNN, and they actually showed the Reagan assassination attempt footage, not JFK. The day after Trump ditched his press pool to go have dinner, CNN got their talking heads on to discuss it and one of them mentioned that the press pool is important to catch footage if anyone tries to make an attempt on the president.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVgR_O5jL_8
I can tell you're not very well versed with how maps work. When you try to represent a 3D sphere as a 2D plane, you get distortion near the poles, making the landmasses appear larger. We get the same problem with maps of Earth, where the very northern landmasses (like Greenland or Russia) appear extremely large when compared with landmasses on the equator of equal area.\n\nCompare the size of a continent on a map like [this](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-TLKJQ-hVmrs/T7PNPHZPpmI/AAAAAAAAADw/5qTXi5FOoU8/s1600/gh.png) versus a map drawn like [this](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7f/World_Map_flat_Mercator.png).\n\nThis is really pretty basic stuff, so perhaps you should get your LOGIC! checked out?
Fucking lol I love how you people are trying to turn "dude" into some kind of pejorative.
Depends how famous you are and how much traction you want the AMA to get. If you're a celebrity or something, admins will beg you to do an AMA.

If you're a nobody and don't care about your AMA getting traction, then hey go click the "Submit an AMA" button right now and have fun.

Are we no longer being banned from /r/Politics for mentioning those three forbidden letters?
I think you have that backwards there. Trump is planning to make it a states rights issue. Hillary on the other hand has made a cop-out of "we need more research," meaning she'll pick the research that supports her historically anti-pot stance, and continues to describe pot as a "gateway drug."\n\n[Trump's stance](https://www.theweedblog.com/donald-trump-breaks-with-republican-platform-on-medical-marijuana/)\n\n[Hillary](http://www.cnn.com/2014/10/16/politics/hillary-clinton-marijuana/)
Seeing as how it's already too late for him to be placed on the ballots of the majority of states, I'm going to have to disagree.
Right, when it comes to Republicans. Now for Hillary on the other hand; Bernie didn't attack her emails once during the primaries. Oooh I remember the rage on /r/SandersForPresident. "Why won't he call her out on it!!?? That would totally sink her campaign!!!" Bernie was controlled opposition the entire time, just collecting donor money and going on nice trips to Italy.

ASU's business model right now is to accept practically everybody and suck them dry of money for as long as they can. ASU's dropout rate is about 60%. This means that getting accepted to ASU means nothing, but if you actually stick through and earn the degree then it's nothing to scoff at. We're rated fairly high on a national scale, especially in the business school. I believe our MBA program is consistently in the top 10.
omg I spent this past Friday at home playing video games, I'm totally an introvert guys! Aren't I special, mysterious, and cool???
They retreat from an argument by claiming\n\n>"My goal was only to create a discourse. Can I just say I am so happy to see all of us coming together to talk peacefully despite our differences and blah blah blah..."\n\nTheir hope is that you drop the argument to instead circlejerk over how magnanimous they are for speaking with you peaceably rather than throwing a liberal tantrum like normal.
I definitely didn't learn how to tank by wasting my time on reddit. I read my class's abilities, and started pressing buttons until I figured out what worked. Once you're able to consistently tank heroics then you can start worrying about whatever autistic details you're concerned about and I didn't read.
Ah hah, "ignorance," the favorite insult of the regressive left; it's absolutely inconceivable to you that someone would legitimately disagree with your world view, so you have to blame any disagreement upon the other person simply not being as smart as you. Like I said, I deal with and interact with Middle Eastern men in my classes every single day, I'm not as "ignorant" as you want to believe. I have to say, I expected this subreddit to have a liberal slant just because it's reddit, but I'm honestly surprised at how hard of a slant it is.\n\nI'll be sure to take lots of social awareness classes and listen to professors tell me that I must love these people. Then can I become an enlightened genius like yourself?

Now he's 100% behind Crooked, said that her medical episode yesterday "is not a big deal" to him, and that Trump is the candidate of fear.\n\nSome people just never learn.
Isn't /leftypol/ your containment board? Go cook some more HotPockets.
From my original post:\n\n>he hasn't made any personal sacrifice\n\nPersonal sacrifice. While I didn't spell it out word for word (thought it would be pretty apparent), I meant "personal sacrifice" as in the father didn't enlist in the military personally, his son did. His son made the decision. If the father had dominion over his son, and he personally made the decision for his son to join the military, then sure the father would have made a sacrifice. How is the father "sacrificing" anything if his son runs off and makes all of the decisions on his own?\n\n>one guy who didn't have anything to say on the issue\n\nI'd say that being a US veteran who has seen combat and seen his friends die makes his opinions relevant when discussing military sacrifice. So you're saying the father (who hasn't seen any combat or served himself) of a soldier has more say on the matter than an actual soldier?
Literally the only reason he was modded was because nobody trusted /u/Lil-z and CisWhiteMaelstrom(/u/TehDonald) after the /r/Mr_Trump schism a few months ago. Now it seems TehDonald has finally convinced Milo to use /r/The_Donald as a cash cow (as was his plan from the very beginning).
Just a heads up, his son is the person who made the sacrifice. His son chose to volunteer for the military, and he sacrificed his own life. It's unfortunate that he lost his son, but he hasn't made any personal sacrifice.

Yeah, these are the pollsters who said he didn't stand a chance in hell of winning the election. However, Rassmussen (who's poll accurately predicted the popular vote during the election) currently has his job approval rating at 55%. \n\nUltimately I don't care what the polls say. He's doing exactly what he said he would during his campaign.
I like the [SNL Spicer parody](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbhz3XcNzGU). Honestly, I don't care what the MSM does at this point.
I ignore the #FakeNews and #FakePolls. They failed miserably to predict the election, and they are failing miserably now. Most of the MSM is in bed with the corporate Democrats, and want to distract people from examining what is really wrong with the Democratic party (e.g. Nancy Pelosi, Chuck Schumer, etc). [Even far left Bernie supporters understand this.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSuMBwZVPt8). Unfortunately many Americans have been duped. Hopefully more and more people will wake up. Redpilling is happening, but not fast enough.\n\nPersonally, I think he's doing a good job considering the MSM, Democrats, and some Republicans are set against him. He wrote a [contract with the American people](https://assets.donaldjtrump.com/_landings/contract/O-TRU-102316-Contractv02.pdf) during his campaign, and [he's sticking to it quite well](https://www.track-trump.com/).

> We could sit for hours with our friends just talking. So hard to do that now.\n\nMaybe it's economics.

I believe in property rights, and earning what you get.\n\nWithout this country Europe would have fallen to the Nazis and Asia to the Japanese. I'd call that pretty great.

I think a lot of liberals have a perception that conservatives hate gay people. Maybe that's the really old establishment conservatism, but I don't see that as much. All the conservatives I know don't care if you're gay or not. They might not understand or agree with it, but they aren't going to hate you because of it.\n\nAnd many of them (like myself) aren't religious and don't care who you love.

* Immigration - Agree\n* Refugee vetting - Agree\n* Net neutrality - Agree\n* Voter ID - Agree\n* Energy - Somewhat agree. Our country is in such a mess right now with the lack of good jobs and a huge debt. We need to fix those issues first, and cheap energy will help. I'm okay with coal in the short term to increase our energy independence and put people back to work but agree that we need a long-term plan to migrate to alternative forms of energy.
Link?\n\nWe need a website with all the killshots.
Ha ha, clearly you don't understand the difference between *legal* and *illegal* immigration. I've never met a Trump supporter who was against a *legal* immigrant. We have the BEST legal immigrants, don't we folks?!\n\nHowever, it doesn't really apply to me. My family was in North America in the 1600s before the United States existed. Unlike some former politicians, I can show them my *original* unforged birth certificate.

President Trump's [Contract with the American Voter](https://assets.donaldjtrump.com/_landings/contract/O-TRU-102316-Contractv02.pdf) has us investing $1 trillion in infrastructure over 10 years. Boy do we need it!\n\nWe need extreme vetting of our dams and bridges.
I'm curious. Do you just record all of your gameplay? How do you do that?
I'm pro life, but not enough to want the Federal government to make laws about it one way or another.

It is common practice by journalists to stage photos, arranging people to pose for the camera.

For me, it's more of not my type of gameplay problem compounded by my type of gameplay being completely shat on.
I love it. \n\nNot the bot, I mean the repeated pattern of people coming here,  post their bot to ask for feedback and instantly become defensive about it. \n\n
No because score is not indicative of how much you actually contributed to the team. \n\nFurther,  not every class of bots score the same way and score as easily. \n\nI can top score by holding my w key and one of the mouse buttons with some bots, how would that be fair? \n\nIf you are winning more than losing, that is the only proof that you are better than the average in the match,  and thus your elo will increase accordingly. \n\nThere is a reason why no esport considers KDA into elo 
They can just rework one or more of the existing weapons for it. \n\nI am in favor of giving the emp a conical aoe rather than cylindrical. \n\nThis allows it to target air far easier and punish slower bots which are already at significant disadvantage far less. 
Except God didn't flood the earth when he was walking among us.
They are having issues with steam login
That is netcode issue.\n\nTry in single player :)
>There's no argument. Who you hit with EMP is your choice. Faster bots come with more momentum, and thus are just as easy to hit if you just try.\n\nFaster bots, namely fliers, can change their direction far faster and escape far easier. Not to mention they tend to engage you from further.\n\n>So, you agree you can manipulate enemy position with DSM. That's good. If you drop a shield and they leave, they clearly deemed something else more important than bothering with you. There's more to it than merely flopping it out, just like romance. You can't really expect to woo them with presents alone, do you?\n\nAs a tanky dps in robocraft, that short few seconds you buy doesn't allow you to get anything accomplished. Those drones will come back for you.
I mained Janna in league of legends and I found myself enjoying playing a hover that does the same thing. \n\nShe ain't tanky,  nor does she have the best heals,  but a dsm,  and very good speed has saved countless teammates. \n\n
You are right, not enough pants half way down, looting and jumping on cars.
Hovers. They are shunned by the veterans,  the new players don't build them, but they work. In solo play,  they work better than sprinters since you aren't crippled after every plasma volley. 
I'm angry
Rails are fine vs lone drones.  When they start healing each other,  even if you have multiple rail bots on your side,  you'd just be wasting energy\n\nAs for flak,  unless you are flying too,  you are just a plasma magnet,  telling every drone player to kill you first. 
With this one particular bot,\n\nI always get at least 1 dc (pre patch), and I only win about 10% of the matches despite doubling the enemy teams best score and kills.
This is a calligraphy fountain pen. Regular ones dont bend this easily. 
I have experienced this to the point where one of my bots gets me matched with completely useless teammates.
Fast or agile or both? 
This should be a sticky, or fixed by FJ. \n\nPreferably the latter
Deaths not inflicted directly as a result of Americans. \n\nThe IBC puts the number of civilians actually killed by Americans(coalition) directly in Iraq to be around 30,000.
I learned the lesson of stop blaming teammates a few years back.\n\nI spent 2 months going from silver 4(placements) to silver 1, every match frustrated me because I kept pushing the blame elsewhere.\n\nThen i spent sometime putting myself in the mindset that I am at fault for the failures and that I can always improve. Went back and analyzed every little mistake I did.\n\n[This](http://i.imgur.com/V8sq4Hm.png) was the result.\n\n
I am in love
They go away after unloading 12 Plasma shots into your bot. You are now at 60% HP.\n\nCongratulations, he won that engagement and you lost even though you "Chased" him away for a second or two.\n\nMoments later, he comes back to unload another volley.\n\nThere is nothing a ground bot can do about this shit other than going having a dedicated medic follow you around or going rail.\n\nThere is no counter play except rail or fly.
Is it me or is wapo actually decent? 
Search competitive starter.  It is probably the only series of tanks on the crf that was designed by an experienced player for the purpose of a high efficiency tank. 
You are advocating the killing of variety rather than just punish speed further.

Actually, on second thought,  this might be a good idea if and only if they limit the number of Tesla blades to 2. Now you won't be a Tesla ball colliding with a Tesla ball hoping rngesus is on your side 
36 years.  I rest my case 
Play a Cruiser
Drones are countered by burst weapons,  yet no burst weapon can hit air.  Rails are the closest thing but not quite the same as burst.  Even still,  they are the best weapon vs drones on the ground we have. \n\nBest part of a burst AA weapon is that it won't effect heavy planes much\n\nBuffing all speed on the ground would make them each feel less unique.   \n\nIn other mobas,  agile,  kiting,  dps are countered by crowd control. Yet, the only form of crowd control here are designed to counter slow moving tanks.  
That means they aren't underrated.  They are exactly as bad as we think they are. 
those will never come back.
If you are on the ground, Rails, Ions,  or SMGs. nanos as side arm.\n\nIf you are in the air, SMGs, Plasmas, and Flak. nanos as side arm.\n\nLOML are more annoying than useful\n\nPSKs are useless\n\nChain Shredder are meh at best when supported by nanos

The lower the smg,  the less effective they are at stopping circle jerks,  picking off stragglers or gaining high scores. 
Worse, they are actually doing shit, beating people up and destroying property.

>3) give MMR based on position and not on team: -example: 1-4th increase 4-12th no change 12-16th decrease\n\nSo free MMR for drones, Ions, and teslas and fuck all tanks?
go back to school man. 
Anecdotal.\n\nYou have to admit that it is a hell lot more difficult to gain score in a tank than in a Tesla.
I even said you'd be down to 60%. On a tank, maybe 70%. Regardless, you are powerless against them.\n\nAnd Congratulations on naming the 2 movements on the ground that do okay.\n\nWheels, Tanks, Sleds, Insects and Mechs have no counterplay to this.\n\nThats 5 movements that are out right useless vs drones.

Fancy for fancy sake
People here are overexaggerating the capabilities of robo3.\n\nIt can 1v1 shit bots and bots that aren't designed to 1v1.

> "if it has more movement parts then it must be OP" stance?\n\nThats not even my stance\n\nWtf? This has nothing to do with the Number of movement parts but rather how much Better these movement parts are.
> way above average movement parts?! who cares? oh no, guess what?! \n\nBeing way above the average movement parts is the very definition of overpowered and not balanced.\n\nYet you said:\n\n>i think drones are balanced.\n\n.\n\n>most people have above average movement parts all around the world, think about it.\n\nBecause everything else are not viable? Hence it is problematic and should be frowned upon?
> just because you define OP that way, it doesn't mean the rest of the world does. \n\nYou don't think being way above the average movement parts isn't OP?????\n\nDafuq

I'd be a lot more of a fan of his if he stops peddling snake oil
Sort of the same for me too. I picked up a drone and a copter earlier, didnt really enjoy it but I wasn't getting killed at all and easily top scoring.\n\nSo I stopped playing them, not just because they were blatantly above everything else but also I didn't really have fun playing god and to be frank, wasn't very entertaining to me.
For agile,  build small.  Focus on using only light weight parts including slopes , rods, eps, and struts. \n\nMega hovers work okay too,  but are better for fliers. \n\nAvoid wings,  rudders,  helium\n\nMake sure your total weight capacity by your hovers exceeds your weight of the bot \n\nFocus on bigger thrusters. Biggest is ideal. 
210 is okay, not great,not bad. It looks like its acceleration isn't particularly good either.\n\nFor 1400 CPU, it isn't great, I think you are using way more CPU than needed for hover lift.\n
Just because you don't play them doesn't mean those that are better than those movement parts are not overpowered.\n\nIt is utterly irrelevant what you like to play.
This is why I stopped watching you guys. Watching drones play is so boring.
no cam controls? :(
Doesn't look like anything to me

They always did.
I just fought one earlier on my glass hover. \n\nHe ended up raging at me,  calling my hover a drone because I one shot him everytime I see him. \n\nThat Is with a dedicated medic on his side. Bots like that can't really do well against plasma bots 
Decent bots?\n\nIt costs maybe only 150k to get a decent bot.

No worries. There are a few other similar channels out there.
The non-aggression principle (or NAP) is an ethical stance which asserts that "aggression" is inherently illegitimate. "Aggression", for the purposes of NAP, is defined as initiating or threatening the use of any and all forcible interference with an individual or individual's property. **In contrast to pacifism, the non-aggression principle does not preclude violent self-defense.** The NAP is considered to be a defining principle of libertarianism.
"In all of my universe I have seen no law of nature, unchanging and inexorable. This universe presents only changing relationships which are somtimes seen as laws by short-lived awareness. These fleshy sensoria which we call self are ephemera withering in the blaze of infinity, fleetingly aware of temporary conditions which confine our activities and change as our activities change. If you must label the absolute, use its proper name: Temporary."\n\n-The God Emperor

Do yourself a favor read the news reports at a few large media networks please ill even accept the cucked ones like CNN or MSNBC, this is because he told Pence that he didn't discuss sanctions, Pence told the congress he didn't discuss sanctions, and he made Pence into a liar.\n\nThat wall just got 10 feet higher btw.

Its worrisome for a billionaire businessman to seek out business in a large city in a world power? That was his job for his entire adult life, and these are the best you can come up with? Half of these are failed venture probes sent to Russia that never materialized, if Putin was propping Trump up wouldn't he use his control of Russian business to force them to work with Trump?\n\nAs for the fighter jet question, im 90% certain those have to be made in the US by law by US companies with security clearance.\n\nAs for the rhetorical question (I only respond because I wish to refute it, you cant just say I cant respond by saying its rhetorical), i dont see anything posted in this article that qualifies as "dealings with people who are closely allied with Putin" buying assets and building buildings with people who are in positions of power in Russia is hardly "allied" with Putin.

OH MY GOD HE CALLED HIS OWN CHILD BEAUTIFUL, WHAT A SICK FUCK /s
Exterior doors could decay faster than interior, that might be cool
thats a typo
I know he's a cuck but Glenn Becks theory is that it was the security community, they admitted on Friday it was their wiretap, and that it's possibly a threat to Trump to not mess with them. "Deny the conversation and we release a transcript, deny that and we release the tape"
> t of victims believe that THEY are at fault that THEY were the predator and they THEY were the ones who led their abuser on. That is exactly what he is displaying right her\n\ntbh he doesnt seem that bad here, hes talking about sexually mature teenage boys, not children as some people claim
that's a optimistic way of looking at it :D
One could argue he only set fire to that building because they knew the shooter and didn't raise any red flags.

I think the one thing we can agree on is pink diamond made rose quartz in the image of humans. If they were supposed to be caretakers blue would use them in the zoo I would think, but it is interesting they were all re-located or originated on the zoo platform. So perhaps you are right. \n\nI'm guessing pink diamond planned her death with rose as her killer. Why I don't know.

An actual onion-like story and not more anti trump stories? What is this.
first of all those are two different questions. But IMO.\n\n1) She waited to long to decide and now the child's body needs her body to survive, at this point it is only a few months from being a baby and if she didn't want to have a child she should of aborted earlier.\n\n2) Yes ofc she can get an abortion if her life is in danger, 1 death is preferable to 2 deaths. It's not like the baby is going to live if we force the mother to die in pregnancy.
well its only possible on PC

Ok but I think we need to keep this quiet until all the black licorice is on trucks heading to the dump, once they are all there we can bury them in dirt, plant some trees and nobody will know what happened.
They get in trouble, it just doesn't make liberal media headlines.
They have a duty to their voters.\n\nIf the young voted more their views would be worth more to politicians
As far as i am concerned these 150,000 protestors have volunteered to house, feed, and clothe refugees out of their own pocket. \n\nThey will not be allowed to volunteer someone else's property to support parasitic colonisers.
I think the first problem with your premise is the idea of 'resistance'\n\nAfter Rome all of Europe disintegrated into small feudal political units for starters. For another the main influences over Italian politics were France, the Holy Roman Empire, the Papacy, and the Byzantine Empire and, later, the British and Spanish Empires. These entities kept Italy separate not because they were threatened by Italian unification, but by keeping wealthy city states within their spheres of influence to have an edge against one another.\n\nNext, there wasn't much of an 'italian identity' and there was no entity deemed legitimate by the entire penninsula to be awknowledged as a unifier until the Napoleonic era when the idea of an Italian nation was born and where you could begin to see a push and a resistance to that push.\n\nHowever when you read contemporary sources, these regions were always called 'italian city states' and were widely regarded as distinct from german city states and French culture. The adjective 'Italian' had been in use since the Roman era if not before that, there was a clear idea of what the penninsula was named and what the people living in that penninsula had in common. In the same way that Europe was a clear entity even if Europeans did not feel a need to share one government.
I think its time that aid stopped being provided to the 3rd world.\n\nTheir population has grown too much, to a point that they cross the sea to leech welfare from the source.\n\nA number of African economists have called for the end of aid for reasons different from mine. Aid is usually funnelled to affiliates of the donor, creates corruption, and stifles economic development by offering goods and services for free.\n\nBesides, its time the GCC, India, and China take the lead on this. Europe has been bled dry.
Nope

Well im glad. I had the impression the Logan movie was basically turning Wolverine into a girl hero
The articlr was about Somalis, i wrote about Somalis. Not africans as a whole.\n\n100% of the jihadist terror attacks suffered by Kenya have been committed by Somalis.
How am i promoting a political agenda? Does that mean they really did neuter their slaves?
I dont blame the drought for rape. That is an idiotic argument that infantilises Africans. \n\nI blame the inhumanity of Somali men
Well not really. The security council was formed by the winners of ww2, at the time only America had nukes. It gave that tech to france and uk, and ussr gave it to china-beijing and india.\n\nFurther, until the 80s or 70s, china-taipei  (taiwan) held china's security council seat
If you ever visited you might notice that many people cant afford those brands.\n\nMy mom's from Iraq, this reminds me of how people in the 70s would tell her 'oh you have lots of oil right' and she'd say 'yeah every morning i go to the well and pull up a bucket for my car'\n\nItalians got into high value merchandise back in the renaissance, all the nobles of Europe bought Italian. Its been that way ever since.\n\nEvery country had trashy people, but  in Italy is it considered rude to talk about money at the dinner table.\n\nFurther i have noticed in the rest of the world its considered normal to ask people how much they make, how much they spent on something, and make material comparisons. In Italy this is extremely rude.\n\nIve met Germans and Britons who would ask me, withoht knowing me, how much i make or talk about how much they make, or even judge my expenses
Always helps to remember that natives were involved at every level of the colonial enterprise. When people blame the white race for the colonisation of India it helps to remember individuals like this woman. There were hundreds of thousands of Samrus\n\nOne big allegation is the idea that the Bengal famine was British responsibility. I'm not British, they often accept blame. However the famine was caused by democratically elected Punjabis and others who held back the food shipments the British allocated for Bengal.

Its also a fact that they all have fingernails, or that they are all wearing clothes. \n\nHow does it matter what they are discussing in Iran? I know they bitched about Trump, and they keep their mouths shut about Islam; and go a step further by wearing headscarves.\n\nThats all that matters to me about this discussion. Doesnt matter if they were going there to open a girl's school, negotiate a trade deal, have an orgy with the mullahs, or to give lectures
How so?
It doesnt we arent communists. There's a difference between flaunting your wealth and elegance

Unfortunately countless people think Romanian = gypsy. Unfortunately contradicting that sometimes sounds racist these days because of the stigma.\n\nThe gypsies didn't help the matter by calling themselves Rom and Romani. They don't do it to claim a connection to Rome, but because Rom means people in their lannguage

Its tacky in Italy and France too and they dont have protestant culture.\n\nAmerica is as protestant as it gets and they are definetly proud of their wealth. Britons too sort of, and i really mean sort of. 
UAE, Lebanon, Tunisia, Kazakhstan, Jordan, Indonesia, Turkey, and Iran in that order\n\nTurkey has Jews living openly, rare for Muslim countries, and there are Jews/Christians in the Iranian parliament\n\nFirst three are almost at a European standard
How so? Not sarcasm, just wish these articles would summarise the issue
Still seems hypocritical to me.

You can't be serious.\n\nDude the Donald is right, its ok to feel embarassed about your country. There is no misinformation here, your feminist government is composed of cowards. They go hard on soft targets, like western men, and they kowtow to Islamic patriarchy.\n\nThere is no misinformation, you are just uncomfortable. Everyone's government does something embarrassing, its ok, Swedes are a lovely people with a great culture.
Dude its a fashion company. If women weren't so dumb these companies would never have advertising budgets. The morons buy torn clothes with no pockets for very high prices, women say do and believe whatever magazines say, whats more they starve and puke/get implants to fit into clothes.\n\nYes ive known a girl who wanted tit implants so\nShe could fit in dresses better. Putting plastic in your chest because of clothes!\n\nOf course they are gonna pander to women. Dumb messages for a dumb gender
are your other 3 grandparents indian/native?
Read the article. It was a trade deal. For that matter there were lots of quotes by Iranian feminists making similar points to mine, only they allege western feminists are interested in money when they bow to Islamic patriarchy whereas i allege that they are traitors to western culture.\n\nSo it looks like you really are wasting time pretending as if i'm not right.

He drives the latter mostly.\n\nI know people who have the really nice suit they wear to weddings and the regular one for work.\n\nMaybe you are such a bigot you think we are all fat dudes with wife beaters and a big gold chain at jacuzzis bragging about how many rooms we have in our houses; but thats not what we are like.\n\nMaybe you should visit, it sounds like you could do with a dose of culture\n\nIn America you have Kardashians and Gates, you're telling me you cant tell the difference?\n\nYou expect me to believe the Aryans all wear potato sacks? 
colonialism is a net benefit. Colonised countries were found largely with sick people in loincloths. They were left with railroads, airports, warships, asphalt roads, a useful language to do commerce with other socieities, updated maps of the earth, computers, satellites, rocket tech, factories, cars.\n\nColonialism is a huge benefit. Europeans had to invent and build those themselves, nobody built it for them and left it behind. 
Never. I will never consent to an affirmative action policy to improve my or any other race on a preferential basis. I will especially not fund the improvement of a population that predominantly desires my population's extermination. I also dont want my population improved as it will be perceived as a threat by all rival ethnic groups.\n\nThe expensive disease treatments are a problem where health is a business rather than a public utility. I am fine offering education, healthcare, and nutrition as state subsidised support for the poor because in some cases it allows a quality person to succeed where they would be limited.\n\nSlippery slope is not a fallacy in the least. Every new policy lends itself to the success of similar policies. This is why gay marriage is legal in denmark and not in Saudi Arabia. Saudis have held back women's rights out of the legitimate concern that it will snowball to European debauchery/equality.\n\nYou may have noticed that polyamory and polygamy are becoming more acceptable. Just as the homophobes predicted gay marriage will then lead to group marriage. When this is brought up people use 'consenting adults' argument, which was the same slippery surface used to legalise gay marriage proving that the slippery slope is not a fallacy but an integral part of the liberalisation process. One right lends itself to more rights and generally the more rights we have the better off we all are.\n\nVaccines do not involve engineering a human being to be superior to others, they grant them an immunity to a disease that can harm the population as a whole. It is not for the vaccinated person's benefit but the society's as a whole.
Because i do not think we have the international consensus we did in the 50s when nuclear non proliferation became a major international agreement that, despite wide support, is violated anyway.\n\nIf America limits itself to curing diseases, and China decides to make super humans, then America cannot allow itself to fall behind in this new genetic arms race
Really?
Shouldn't anyone go berserk at the thought of genetically modifying a person?\n\nWhat if it goes wrong? There are also unintended side effects, or the Nazi wet dream that is eugenics.\n\nWhat does this have to do with vaccines?
And they use other excuses. This article suggests that if there were no drought there wouldnt be rape.\n\nSomali men are inhuman because they wait for a woman to go shit and piss, leaving her protectors, to rape her in a way that is closer to something an animal would do than what a human would do.\n\nHere in the west most rape occurs because a woman changes her mind about the drunk sex she had the night before
What are you talking about? They dont care whether we say yes or no. We do say no actually and they show up anyway.\n\nThe only reason this keeps happening is because the majority of migrants survive the crossing and get to live in Italy or Europe at taxpayer expense\n\nIf none survived they would stop coming. Israelis executed migrants trying to cross through Sinai. They don't cross through the Sinai anymore.

You know how some subreddits have like sub-sub reddits where you can filter out certain...im not sure how to explain it.\n\nLike in subreddits with 'spoiler' tags.\n\nMaybe you can add a tagging system so we can tune in or out to castles and bridges of Europe/brexit and migration/ travel advice stuff
Also, and i mean seriously, Obama was not a racist or the most racist president. Neither was Trump.\n\nThe first handful of presidents were actual slavers. Also Woodrow Wilson was i think some kind of racist.
And the cops and court didnt try to euthanise your dog?\n\nSome jurisdictions offer extensive legal protections for burglars and similar subhumans
Iran has Christian and Jewish citizens (and members of parliament)\n\nI suspect they are also required to wear hijabs in Iran.\n\nSwedish feminists, and all feminists, must never criticize western society. Western society invented feminism and gave women rights. Those 'women' should stay silent about western men if they are too cowardly to criticise Islam
The homophobes were right. Gay marriage is going to lead to group marriage, then incest, and finally pedophilia in that order.\n\n
So peaceful protests are only legal when they are left wing? 
How am i back-pedalling? \n\nAnd yes, they are absolutely traitors.
Nuclear technology was developed for a military purpose. Then it proliferated from the US and went from being used for aerial bombardment to warheads for rockets, submarine mounted rockets, truck mounted artillery.\n\nThen it was legitimated for energy uses, which produced radioactive waste, which along with nuclear testing has lead to a great deal of pollution. Some of which finds itself in dirty bombs that may or may not have been used by governments.\n\nThis technology is tightly internationally regulated, and yet a number of people have been harmed whether at Chernobyl and Fukushima by way of a poorly designed plant or by way of nuclear testing like a number of pacific islanders from Bikini Atoll.\n\nSo yes, i do think that technological progress should never be assumed to be limited. It will start with removing genetic illnesses and will become a process for a eugenicist's wet dream. \n\nHuman genetic modification, and automation, cannot be treated as a purely positive development. They must be tightly regulated and predominantly banned at an international level. \n\nAs much as we wont produce nuclear powered generators and consumer automobiles due to the risks to the population we cannot permit human modification due to the societal problems it will create, or automation as the last thing we need is to make 6 or 7 billion humans obsolete and unemployable.
A day off or two? She flies a plane.\n\nShe should be banned from flying. Maybe this is one job that should be replaced with robots.\n\nRemember Germanwings? Psychotic pilot crashes plane because he feels bad about stuff? This lady could have done the same. I am grateful for our sexist culture that allows women to express their feelings without us questioning their womanhood and exposing them to ridicule.\n\nBut she shouldnt be allowed to fly. Idc about her political views pilots should not be insane.
Globalisation is all the benefits of empire with none of the costs. All resources may be bought or exploited by the highest bidder. At the same time there is no obligation to send troops to fight over 3rd world territories, build forts and cities, feed and abuse locals, spend your taxes teaching them your language and religion.\n\nThat whole expensive side is gone, you reap rewards and throw some charity.
You're shitting me
You think they got that successful from domestic sales? You know we're a poor country now right?
Colonial enterprises were actual trade losses. European countries wasted tons or money building stuff in colonies. Its why America became economically dominant in 1800s, they werent wasting money on empires but reaped the profits from trade\n\nEuroppean countries got a lot richer after WW2 for the same reason. They kept control over 3rd world resources from capitalism, had the tech to use resources, and outsourced military and politics to local leaders saving them huge expenditures.

Because love is un-Islamic
well yeah
Funny how Jews in America and the West demand that we take more Muslim asylum seekers while Jews in Israel are mass producing Muslim asylum seekers by ethnically cleansing them from Israel/Palestine
They live hard lives.
Dirty bombs dont exist because nuclear power is tightly regulated at the international level. It remains astonishing to me that its spread as little as it has. We do not allow average consumers to purchase and use it. It goes through the government. It is tightly regulated because it is dangerous.\n\nIn this day and age i do not think another consensus is possible. If America makes limits to only remove genetic diseases it cant stop China from mass producing super humans, so then America will have to produce super humans and so on.\n\nImagine the migration crisis when the 3rd worlders realise getting pregnant in Europe or America means their children will be made into super humans at the hospital on the European/American taxpayers' dime. Far more expensive than granting citizenship to anchor babies.
Poor guy, do you know how hard it is to find a job without having 3 years work experience in that field?
When the richest races are White and Asian it means that their populations will be improved whereas those of poorer races (black and brown/mixed) will continue to have genetic defects which will legitimate racism.\n\nIn the future genetically engineered humans will get preferential employment because company insurance won't cover someone with preventable illnesses that could have been prevented by a eugenicist.\n\nFurther you'll have people engineering their kids to be tall, light eyed, giant dick, six fingers, super strength, super intelligence etc. The entire field lends itself to racism because it won't stop at removing genes that trigger cancer, diabetes etc. \n\nUnless we want to go full ant colony and modify all humans it will create a new societal division. I don't think that its necessary. Medical practitioners will change their focus and it will become more acceptable to deny treatment to those who are genetically inferior to the modified humans.\n\nAll in all, terrible idea. And this hasn't even addressed errors. Who do you sue when you had your fetus purged of disease genes and he's born with 3 eyes and a vagina on each thigh? 
So he makes his fortune and then makes sure pull up the ladder he used and lock the door that was open for him.\n\nHe should give away his profits before banning the easy way he made his fortune, piece of shit 
Wait... so are you saying if women ruled the world there would be an enclave of men that ruled their own country they would all subjugate themselves to?
How do I check on my ps4 time played?

But the average hack and slash shit over and over and over and.. you get the idea.  Fuck.  It just goes on and on.
I'm not a mindless drone, Obama was great and Bush did it! Haha

Oh fuck yeah, I wish I was poor and destitute like a democrat begging for basic income.
Bookmarked.  You're doing a great service 'pede.  Thank you for your hard work.
A sperm will never magically grow into a human all by itself.  That's the same as saying every time a woman has her period she kills a baby.  \n\nBut, you put the two together and without outside assistance they will create a baby in enough successful attempts to propagate the human species. \n\nSame thing with children though.  Without adults they'd just die.  I mean, what fucking good are they?  They can't find food or support themselves.\n\nLet's abort those fuckers too when it gets too expensive, right?
They actually do believe hard work is terrible.  Success = evil
I think you're a prime example of people working themselves into a frenzy.  Do you believe you're working against someone with differing opinions or someone evil?
That's how Trump supporters feel as well!  Welcome to the club, champ!
We're making America great again, not making America not terrible again.
Don't talk politics at work.  Especially in this environment.  If you know you're right, it doesn't matter how many are wrong.  Fuck them. \n\nGet off work, come here and MAGA.
Just call them leftists, they're all the same party.  They wouldn't give us the benefit of the doubt about who their worst are.  This is what they bring to the table.  This is a part of who they are.
Twitter is seriously just online mass hysteria with pockets of resistance.  The majority of users on that site are human garbage.
Only idiots will think this is a Trump negative, on either side of the isle.  He's cute, adorable, and small.  People will eat this up.  \n\nIt will humanize him way more than anything I've seen so far.  I love it.
So are we so innocent or not?
*on a website that doesn't allow posts from the sub on their front page.\n\nWe ban nay sayers but you don't allow us to even have a voice without restrictions.  Who's worse? \n\nEat dicks.
I don't understand what the title of your post means, but this guy is a definite idiot.  Deport.  Out out out.
You know there's 50 muslim majority countries and this is just 7, right?  He left off a vast majority.  The countries were Syria, and 6 countries deemed high risk by DHS under Obama.
I don't know if this is a legitimate response, but I've never seen a front page tucker video that is 2 hours long when his show is like 40-45 mins after commercials.
"This guy I supported is doing things he said he would do way too fast and effectively.  He's easily the fastest working president we've ever seen in our lifetime, I'm furious and disappointed." - No one ever

A) It is fucking baby murder.  You can call it a lump of cells but if they found a few single celled organisms on mars tomorrow they'd sure as fuck call it life.\n\nB) What if you never got a test to find out it's a downs baby?  I don't remember anything before I was about 5 or 6.  Could we just kill a 1 or 2 year old if it was born downs and no one knew before hand?  I mean, it's too young to hold a memory, complete a thought, provide to society, or raise a complaint.  I mean, fuck that kid, right?
I only worked there a few months, couldn't get an answer as to why.  Just know they do.
Thank you.  Easy enough to just say it.  I appreciate your input.
Not much.  Americans spend about $2600 per person per year on food, at 318m people that's over $800B.  We only import about 18B worth of produce from Mexico, or about 2% of what we consume.\n\nMost of our imports are manufactured goods and if you haven't been paying attention lately, manufacturers are investing in America and creating new plants and remodelling old ones.
I needed that right before bed, thanks 'pede.
If  you're here and he says he's doing "a million" bad things, I think you two have different ideological beliefs.  You wouldn't be able to convince him without fully changing his personality. \n\n That would take either a massive life event or a great deal of... attitude adjustment?  Well I don't know what to call it, he would need to look at life, politics and the future of our nation in a completely different light than he does.\n\nNot something that's going to happen over a post or two on the internet or a conversation in real life.  Most people are entrenched in their beliefs and budging them from that position is hard.
>The Rasmussen Reports daily Presidential Tracking Poll for Thursday shows that 59% of Likely U.S. Voters approve of President Trump’s job performance\n\nhttp://www.rasmussenreports.com/public_content/politics/political_updates/prez_track_jan26
That's funny.  Yeah it's unlikely.
Curious.  How do you feel about an increased minimum wage in America, or increased Corporate/business taxes?  \n\nDo you think those create the same type of net negatives as paying an American our current wages to do the work of these illegal immigrants/migrants?\n\nWhere do you personally believe federal money has to come from to increase or decrease quality of life for Americans?\n\nAlso do you think it's moral to continue to allow illegal immigration/migrants to work for less than we pay Americans for our benefit?
I have 3 into axii, 3 and 6 into quin or whatever, the shield and heal on hit.  A few into the quick attack points and one into cat skill or whatever that gives bonus dmg into quick attacks per light armor piece. With a blue mutagen making up a 20% sign strength buff.\n\n
The_Donald, a sub you have to seek out, that has less than 1/30th the subscribers of this default sub, has just over half as many visitors online right now as this sub.\n\nIt's just over 1/10th of the size of the default "neutral" politics sub and also has just over half their current numbers online.\n\nEvery single post on their front page every single day, pretty much any moment of the day has thousands of upvotes while being mostly restricted from the front page of reddit.\n\nAll of this on a website that has been deep liberal for 10 years. \n\nI think people who voted for Donald are pretty stoked still.\n\nEdit: Words and letters
But there isn't a muslim ban, it's a ban of 7 high risk countries that only make up about 12% of the muslim population in the world.  So the ban doesn't effect 88% of muslims at all.
He's been vaporized.  He's now an unperson.  Don't mention him or the Thought Police will definitely come to get you.
What a joke of a comment.  You leftists categorize people who support nationalism, trump supporters, everyone you disagree with as "part of the problem" every day and they're your countrymen.  \n\nThinking the US is in the hands of a tyrant is definitely a form of hysteria and you should probably seek therapy bud.
Before you read this, I'm a Trump supporter.  But I'm just going to throw this out there.\n\nI'd bet he receives millions of messages on twitter a week.  He doesn't read them.  You can "distract him" all you want.  But he uses the platform to say things.  Not to read your super witty responses.\n\nTalk on twitter.  Waste your breath.  It's a microphone, not headphones.\n\nEdit: Words
I've never seen that technique used to cut twine.  If we didn't have a knife to cut it, we would use a stick and wrap the twine around it by spinning the stick until the tension caused it to snap.\n\nWhat exactly are you doing?  How do you keep the twine from sliding up and down the bale when you pull it? 
I'll just hold you at your laugh actually.\n\nFrom your page I grabbed...\n\nThere are 23 Democratic seats, eight Republican seats, and two seats held by independents up for election in 2018. \n\nDo you think we will lose more Dems or Reps?  Just wondering if your snideness had a cause.
You don't need proof to refute. You need proof to claim/accuse/prove.  Are you high?
So do you guys think stuff like this makes him actually lose sleep at night or just shoot off a tweet?  Because I could tweet right now.  In fact, I think a tweet would take less effort/characters than this post. \n\nI think you give too much credit to him getting "triggered" and not enough credit to what he's actually doing.  But that's ok.  You'll learn in 2018 and 2020.
wtf... I love war now
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women_in_Iran#Women.27s_clothing\n\n>Since the official reveiling in 1984,[120] post revolutionary Iranian women's fashion gradually evolved from the monotonous chador to its present form, where a simple headscarf (rousari) combined with other colorful elements of clothing has become more predominant.[102][116] In 2010, 531 young females (aged 15–29) from different cities in nine provinces of Iran participated in a study the results of which showed that 77 percent prefer stricter covering, 19 percent loose covering, and only 4 percent don’t believe in veiling at all.[122] A tendency towards Western dress correlated with 66 percent of the latest non-compliance with the dress-code.[122]\n\n
What is senpai?  Also, the president doesn't have to publicly condemn every world leader the media decides to have a problem with.  \n\nAnd if you think Russia is our greatest enemy/counter culture, while middle eastern countries burqa women, stone rape victims, toss gays off buildings, prevent women from driving, education, and fully functional genetalia then you're part of the problem
I wonder if he gives daily thanks to Trump at a little alter.  He was a nobody surrounded by controversy with a career in slow death, and now retards talk about him every day.  \n\nDo you think he realizes if Trump is gone he's nobody again?
Rule 5, no infographics.
Unreal.  Right?
Tell him.  Now.  Waiting only makes it worse.
I think I understand what you're saying and I think the situation would be very different in a blank slate.  \n\nAs someone from my perspective sees it there is absolutely collusion between the media.  Both news groups and the way social media operates.  With the only way to verify being seeing their actions.\n\nSo when you have the news and every major player in social media seem to collude against the president, I don't fully expect him or people close to him not to defend themselves.\n\nHad it been a blank slate, and people weren't trying to basically commit character assassination 24 hours a day every single day, I may see something like that out of the ordinary.\n\nBut at this point it seems like someone that isn't Trump but involved in the campaign going, "Look at these people trying to destroy someone uninvolved, go buy her stuff." and not like some ploy by the President.\n\nAlso, I don't listen to leftists talking about slippery slopes.  They've played that down for years.  Nobody listened to the right when they said it would be a slippery slope about gay marriage and now we somehow have transgender boy/girl scouts, a national conversation about bathrooms, and articles all over liberal sites like salon and Jezebel talking about pedophile understanding.
Look at you.  Your post history even after this point is despicable.  You're just a mean spirited angry fucking ass hole.\n\nTake a break from the internet to fix yourself, then come back.  Living off anti Trump karma while being an overall shitty human.
You just correlated a lack of illegal immigrants to an increase in prices and a lack of produce.  So they're good for low paying jobs and cheap manual labor.
Everything you hate about him I either like or don't care about.
Old article I know, but something tells me those numbers haven't changed for the better since then.
You're a know nothing.  I get it.  That "psychology" bit was your best insult and now this is what you bring.  No insight.  Nothing.\n\nYou're probably not even worth talking to.  Either some kid, or a  fucking nobody with nothing to say.
Don't delete this post, saving it so I can grab links whenever
Well, I did it but it's not retroactively applying it to my original post.  Seems to effect the last one though.
How many hours am I suppose to devote?  Dude, it's taken at least a dozen or two just to run around in a level appropriate way in the second map.  \n\nThis game is fucking ridiculous with it's repeated battle and back tracking on the map for quests vs message boards.
http://edition.cnn.com/interactive/2017/01/politics/trump-inauguration-gigapixel/\n\nThis is the best picture I've found, but I haven't really looked into the crowd thing much because it seems fairly stupid.  It's interactive so make sure you scroll around to look toward the Washington Monument, but the place is fucking shoulder to shoulder packed in every direction you can see.
Was this the discredited info from the Reuters parody twitter account or is there new info?
I give you an upvote because you deserve it, but none of that matters and your ability to drink beer and eat meat doesn't make us the same.\n\nI don't hate you.  We have a different way of viewing life.\n\nUnfortunately politics have invaded everything.  And where you fall on the political spectrum matters.\n\nI enjoy free speech, guns, the free press, equal rights, America first, helping the needy, Church, family, friends, booze, and my dog.\n\nYour side, at this point in history, seems like traitors to me.  They want to limit free speech because they don't like it (saying things you don't like is the whole point of free speech), want to take away guns, limit media that doesn't push an agenda \n\n( I realize Trump can seem that way too because he regularly calls media outlets fake news looking for fair coverage.)\n\nYour equal rights seem to me like some people are more equal than others with your talk of privilege and constantly bad mouthing whites and Christians for causing problems while trying to import Islam en masse into our country.\n\nI don't think we'd compromise.  We've gone past compromise.  \n\nYou call us fascists but preach fascist ideals.  What do you want from us besides boot licking?
Love it, thanks 'pede\n
I've watched it a few times since I posted that question, I think he's pulling at the friction point between the antlers and the hay bail.  That would be a lot harder to do without something (the deer) pulling on the twine.
What the fuck is this?  I look for front page Tucker and I get a post about 2 and a half hours of a nobody talking?  Is there a normal video.   This guys show isn't 2 hours long, what the fuck?
Good luck trying to figure that shit out.  Obama came out of fucking nowhere.  There's a huge range of ages in my fathers offspring but my second to youngest brother voted for him because "It's time we had a black president".  \n\nIf people don't wake the fuck up to that shit we could have a minority president for fucking ever as we work our way down the oppression ladder.\n\nEdit:  Not that I disagree with a non white president, just don't think that should be a qualifier for the job, policy and America first policies for our president.
No one thinks that.  That's why they need vetted.  You allow the people who want to leave their back wood gay stoning, women suppressing, rape victim murdering ways and leave the ones who want to continue their shitty way of life there.\n\nI don't know why liberals have a hard time understanding what vetting is.\n\nIf you want to come to America and love America and our way of life, great.  You want to ship in a few hundred thousand people that want to protest what a shitty country we are while waving a foreign countries flag like the illegals in California, then I have a problem with that.\n\nNo reason to import discontent.
Why do people think this is happening?  He's doing everything he's said he'd do for like the last year and a half.  There have been no surprises.\n\nPeople who voted for candidate X that is completing all of their campaign promises, why do you hate that?
If you enjoy this sub, reddit isn't for you.  Every day you'll see chains of "I hate this fucking cuck factory" posts in comments.
It would be a pretty ineffective muslim ban since it only effects about 12% of the worldwide muslim population.
Found it in my history.  I did not take/make this photo, just pasting what I saw linked earlier\n\nhttps://pbs.twimg.com/media/C3Y84nWWQAAvVKt.jpg:large
I had a chance to explain an open ended question in a sea of infinite response. If you want to know what I think ask me specific questions about specific topics.  You give me an open ended question I'm going to give you a short response.\n\nWhen someone doesn't have specifics on what they want to know I always assume they're giving me just enough rope to hang myself.  I'm sure you've got a lot of talking points you're really good at "gotcha"ing.  \n\nYou want insight, ask specifics.  Or just hurl insults about my "mindset", ass hole.\n\nEdit: A word
You know you don't belong here.  Why are you here?  You could get upvotes posting your dumb shit on /r/redacted.
I love these kind of comments.\n\nYou call Trump a racist but see illegal immigrants as a near slave labor force for low wages for giant corporations. 
None.  No.
Mostly because of anti americanism, pro islam, pro pedophelia, anti white people, man hating feminist, shitty journalism with a terrible spin on everything about the country that allows them to spew this garbage.
That's actually genius.  Could you imagine every post online negative of trump followed by  - This post has been brought to you by Whatever the popular fuck trump company is currently.
Impressed with your witty response, everyone gave you a crisp $100 bill
Then you don't understand power structure.  Just context.
>I realize this post may look confrontational but that is not my intent \n\nThis is known as [sea lioning](http://nancyfriedman.typepad.com/away_with_words/2014/11/word-of-the-week-sea-lioning.html).\n\nGoing to touch on things I know about though.  Civil asset forfeiture never went away as far as I know?  Happens every day across the US with law enforcement unless I'm mistaken.  If it didn't happen, that would be news to me.\n\nNever saw the bowling green interview with KAC though.  Read about it in hindsight but that makes it seem probably more reasonable to someone like me since there was the arrests of the two Iraqi men trying to fund Al-Qaeda or whatever radical islamists called themselves at the time.\n\nAs for her telling folks to buy Ivankas clothes or whatever, I don't care.  Most people I know irl who are upset about it couldn't tell me her actual position anyways.  They just know it's a Trump thing so must be bad. \n\n And getting a lecture about ethics over clothing endorsement from the party that supported the candidate on the side of American death in Benghazi, lax behavior with classified information, or  constant corruption through the DNC's primary behavior seems almost laughable.\n\nThe global warming thing I'm not smart enough to comment on one way or the other.  I would just be taking one groups word or another.  I don't have the ability to find that information out for myself.\n\nThe Johnson amendment is the only thing I see eye to eye with you about.  It opens more loop holes for rich ass holes like George Soros to exploit.
It would have to be on the far string, which I think is right the way the deers head jerks when it's cut free.  \n\nThe closest string of twine would create a V between either the corners of the bail or the antler and the opposite edge of the bail which would move back and forth as he pulls his twine, making it harder to cut.\n\nEdit: A letter
Anything, MMA, boxing, fuck, buy a heavy bag, watch and impliment training videos on youtube.\n\nIf you don't know how already, learn to take care of yourself.  These people are getting crazy.
I love when they ask a question that he finds preposterous.  He just goes from this smiling guy to "You all should be fucking embarrassed of yourselves" from one sentence to the next.
This is true.  Bank of America offers free wire transfers to mexicos banco santander.  You don't get free wire transfers anywhere.
My bad, how do I get flair?  Definitely a supporter but not apart of any reddit social group outside of hanging out in the_donald all day.
This is too funny.\n\nLiberals: Raise business and corporate taxes, as well as minimum wage, they don't pay enough and it won't effect prices!\n\nAlso Liberals:  Don't raise foreign nations taxes, it will hurt us and raise the cost of goods!\n\n
How will the dems force anyone to do anything?  You couldn't stop a single cabinet pick so far.  You have nothing.  Are nothing.  This site is just a laughing stock of a bunch of jerk offs without an arm.
Are you retarded?  Look at my post history.  I just wanted a video of the show without commentary.
Want to give me insight on your political genius? Why are you posting in political threads?  So smart.
You're so talented, thank you for creating google.  I'm glad the site you linked didn't have anything to do with google or a simple answer.  What do you think would serve me better?  \n\nA smart ass remark and a random website link, or an actual answer?
Wow, you sure give the subjugation of women a huge pass.  If it's legally required in their country, it's not a choice.  If it's been instilled in their head since their birth, it's brainwashing.\n\nYou are equating a national/religional (?) law/dogma to a wardrobe choice on a Sunday morning.  What do you think happens to women there that don't abide by the rules?  
The block is still in place.  The stay only effects folks that were already in transit.  No new migration from said countries.  MAGA
This is the only thing that would make things better.  Mexico needs to fucking fix Mexico.  Why would a shitty country full of corrupt officials ever try to stop exporting their poor?
The post of excitement for being legally able to give your baby fetal alcohol syndrome is posted by an account titled Women's Rights News.\n\nThe joke is fetal alcohol syndrome babies become feminists because of their disability.\n\nSo an account dedicated (if not a troll account) to womens rights information is touting the empowerment of women by allowing them to cause harm to their offspring.
I saw it too and it was just gone when I refreshed the page.  No (deleted) or (removed) just gone.

We have one on the North side of my town.  Called the Heart Mountain Camp.  Weird place for an internment camp.
They have many of them, they will fly some vehicles there ahead of time in a C5 Galaxy.
Impressive collection, your driveway looks like mine.
They helped my country, the USA, win our revolutionary war and have been allies in democracy ever since then.  So shove it up your ass.

I deleted my Twitter account, good things are happening.
"Free Trade" has been one globalists use too, sounded good to a lot of people until jobs freely moved to countries with no labor and environmental laws.  Being anti-globalist was the first thing that attracted me to Trump's way of thinking.
Imgur still blocking Trump related content.

Courteous towards our president, respectful and thoughtful.  Everything our media isn't.
I'm willing to bet this person drives a lowered pickup truck with a bunch of cheap plastic crap hanging off of it and I'm also willing to bet this thing wouldn't fire in an emergency tactical situation.
Tactical > popular
If this goes on for more than half an hour, I'm going to be very disappointed in the police; other people live in that neighborhood.  Time for law and order.
An armed society is a polite society.
The God Emperor is double red pilling everybody.
Possibly, I've had some good posts that seem to be ignored.  I'm starting to not care much for twitter.  It's difficult to make a decent point in a short sentence and some of these leftists will respond to a tweet 95 times in a row; I've been trying to encourage them to go outside and see the world.
I tried to give them another chance earlier while looking for a story, they were really showing their bias, negative about the President's "creepy" handshake.
If this is really happening than this is the best news I have heard in a long time.  Well since we last won yesterday anyway.
Looks clean and solid.
He was the only one, other than Trump during the primaries that said anything interesting.  "If you want boots on the ground in Syria, vote for someone else besides me"
My favorite post of the day.
Yet he supported this lunatic psychic lady http://6336-presscdn-26-82.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/sylvia_montel.jpg\n\nlisten to Howard Stern making fun of him on youtube

That looks really amazing!
God Emperor Donald has NO BRAKES!
You people are savages, use a big 32oz cup.
I don't want to know what that means.
The only thing that could have made this better is if Trump had turned in to a bald eagle and flow away instead of leaving on Air Force One.  That almost actually happened, but the dishonest media probably won't report it!
Does he have male parts?
This isn't even remotely offensive. :)
I would pay an obscene amount of money to see the expression on her face change.  In fact I'm going to YouTube right now to watch Crooked Hillary supporters on election night again!
Anyone who believes that guy needs to remember, he might just be trying to get the spotlight, he is the son of one of the most notorious criminals of all time.  Also, he might be trying to shift blame and attention away from his own illegal activity.  Most likely he is trying to get paid to tell his story and needs it to sound good.
I always thought he had a cool name though.
Ahh, I know they used a C-130 when Clinton came to Wyoming, looks like they use them all depending on what they are doing, but rarely c-5 looking it up now.

Probably best to wait ,  look at the benchmarks with the new gpu's @ 4k . Altho a freesync monitor is also future proof too :/. The new gpus should also have a market impact on 4k monitors so the prices may come down as the market gets more competitive . Waiting just feels like the better option but thats my Opinion 
Thanks , that's exactly what i'm planning to do now

You can view the Errors in Windows .. Computer -> manage -> event viewer -> windows logs -> system
Maybe but can you just explorer further like to the next area /town/portal/w.e \n\nOn the other hand I have stolen alot of things which I guess was required for some quests in order to progress. think I may have bugged a couple of chains. Items I stole I Vendored a while back / maybe I can systematically work my way back through all the vendors if the items still belong in their inventory :/
not sure what to say here ....
Ooo nice :) -- Good luck everyone !

Go to computer management Event viewer - > windows logs -> System and find the major problems, then google them if your unsure :\n\nhttp://www.coretechnologies.com/WindowsServices/event-viewer-system-logon-failure.jpg\n\nits hard to pinpoint your problem but at least this will start you off.\n\nAlso try update your GPU drivers ( if you say it happens when gaming ).
would really like to this game :( , any spare passes ?
just beware of bugs : http://www.reddit.com/r/Banished/comments/1yed0e/markets_killing_my_town/

They customer service is amazing . The helped me out with a few games in the past . Steam and ubisoft on the other hand , dont bother
I loved this game , and recently over Christmas bought it again on origin as i know i want to play it again :)
Cant you just rebuild with what hardware you want . Then reinstall win 7/8 . then upgrade to 10 . then use the media to create another bootable usb to install 10 fresh ?.
Security Essentials 
this was my thinking process too , maybe by then they will reveal the 480x or 490 ? not sure
ooo shiney , any spare ?
RemindMe! 4 hours\n
will more experienced players be able to get round the matchmaking system by not equipping these epics , thus becoming (smurfs)? . how would matchmaking balance when an experienced player is in a party with newbies ?
Well the mod is a mod and can be loaded into the main module of the game . so yes it would work straight away.\n\nHowever im not sure is NPCs can be controlled by anyone . they would have to be of type player maybe . like "player 2" could be the "GM"
I played the Demo , it was fun . you can pick up the full game on play for a couple of quid
wow dem graphics . after playing in HD, there's no way that still looks like the same game . \n\nhttp://static-2.nexusmods.com/15/mods/110/images/607-3-1326205409.jpg
Ill take them if you don't want them :P 
mine does this too , maybe their logic is the user sees their connection faster than normal so they would keep it open incase they dont get that speed the next turn round . says EA all over it ... FALSE
Thats an aerial goal , not a dunk.

if you make an account with them it shows all your online devices . I think i used that alot as there is no need to keep the connection open all the time :) . you made need to change the power options on the pc in case is sleeps/hibernates \n\nSignup for free and login with with each device and make it remember it :)
dont do drugs kids
Thanks i did this and then the game worked again for another 15 minutes then it crashed again.
wow i have friends that play this , good luck to everyone !
I just threw up in my mouth 
It is but i want to get the most out of this experience

I am amazed that he wrote that entire article and couldnt understand the dual monitor .. but it must of been hard to ignore it while comparing everything, I think he is just a troll. as he said "we got butthurt incoming"\n\nand the authors response himself confirms this : "Billy D, A.K.A., William Usher, has been rustling Jimmies for years. The fanboys cried and their tears became his milkshake."

I have returned to the game since buying it on release date. I only play for 2 months and didnt get very far , however since i have returned i am defiantly enjoying the story . The games deserves credit so i renewed by subscription :).

Did you guys also participate in the beta ?wondering if the profiles are getting mixed up ?
I did the same . I think its was worth it :) 3 points for 4 . and its better to cap that early as 1 point doesn't mean that much later on the in the game
what a save !\n
Hmm i think there will be an option down the bottom left say something along the lines of " do it later " during the prompt for CD Key \n

I see what you're saying but I feel like both sides need to be honest.

(I'm in no way saying the right is innocent of this, it's just the left we are discussing about right now)

>but muh *MUSLIM BAN* cost Boeing a 30 billion dollar deal with Iran!!\n\n
Very impressed that you can articulate your feelings and share them like this. I admit too, I don't and likely will continue to not fully agree with Trump but I understand the rules of the game and the much needed cooperation to run and affective American government. People are currently giving way too much credit to the executive branch which is unfortunate because the whole point of a three branch system to prevent tyranny. People fail to see just how much room the president has to act, and the other branches are there to double check and retract any unlawful actions (a prime example would be the immigration ban being repealed and adjusted. That's not an example of a tyrannical Trump, it's the system working as intended).\n\nI find myself at the same conclusion you reached; if there's this much vehement, barbaric, constant hate and violence shown by the far left then there must be something good that Trump is doing (or at least challenging) that I need to look into further.\n\nGood people don't respond violently, bad people do. \n\nBut above all, I feel as though Americans (people in general but I don't speak for them) have lost the ability to reason, discuss, and exchange ideas fluently in an intellectual and peaceful manner. I'd love to PM any ideas you want to discuss on. Always love a civil convo

There's a distinct lack of pro trump policies though.

TIL that Deep Throat gets the better end of Dick
Born or naturalized, illegal immigrants are neither born nor naturalized (acquire citizenship) \n \nThus, as shown, are not protected by constitutional law 
Got in an argument with my professor saying US taxpayers shouldn't be funding overseas endeavors not related to the US. She said 'the world is better when we work together' 
>hello my name is *vomits uncontrollably*\n
Then it becomes an argument of when are we taxed? Income is the simplest and happens right off the bat. We can be taxed other ways that allow citizens to revive benefits. Why would you punish someone for working a successful job (with high requirements to get). That person is going to feel some level persecution and also have less ability to contribute to a functioning economy.\n\nLet's say the burden of income tax (50%) was shifted to various purchasing taxes and a person has a million. That goes from a 500,000 direct income to the government and 500,000 for the person to spend, to 1,000,000 for the person to spend and shift the income on companies. They pay more for producing goods, still have some income tax to pay but the citizen gets more net benefit and feels happier. They still pay more for the goods but have options on what goods and, spread out, pay the same to the government.\n\n
They entered a country illegally and don't deserve the benefits that legal residents observe. She would not be in this specific situation if she wasn't in the country to begin with. It's unfortunate but these are two distinct issues: illegal entry and residence (deportation) and the man committing domestic violence (jail/deportation). 
I'll be honest. After reading that, I'm not sure what to think of the comment now. \n\n(I feel my point in general still stands though)
"Cooking the books" is flat out wrong. What the author referenced was the Trump admin estimating 3-3.5% growth (1% more than last year) and adjusted budget numbers to meet that projected growth. That estimate might be baseless but they are literally setting the budget to what they feel will fulfill that growth curve.\n\nThey are doing exactly what the author said a 'normal' admin would do except they are forcing a stronger economy rather than playing ball with what they have now. They want to reach a 3% increase and are making sure they will have the budget to do so. \n\nThis is just setting up a term with goals of charging the economy. There is no proof of (and barely reference to) 'cooking the books'
HuffPost just grew 2 sizes today 
>a day or two without being enormously incompetent\n\nIn what ways though? Every allegation, accusation, and assumption has been tried, investigated, and found wanting. He can't help a media and party wanting *any* reason to impeach him. The fact that he has been found innocent of al largess claims shows anything but incompetence  
Something something I bought 1984 to fight off the Republicans\n 
The first sentence determines jurisdiction as those 'born or naturalized of the United States' \n\nAnd *those people* are protected by the constitution.

>affiliated in a *nongovernmental* way\n\nThat would leave me to believe it's okay on the context of Ivanka as her family is in the government? Or does it apply since she specifically does not serve? \n\nEdit: not dismissing the subway/michele part. I understand the point you made

>some horrible actions or attitude that needs to be taken  against conservatives of all ages \n\n"oooooooooohhhh"
Because America has no culture :^ )
Criminals should not be recognized as deserving the same rights as law abiding immigrants 
>just a conspiracy\n\nI mean I wouldn't call it a conspiracy that he's innocent. It just take the FBIs word for it 
Don't do that where you twist my words. I'm obviously referring to a 1% growth *overall*. \n\nAnd for your second point, [based on the source that the WaPo article uses](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/A191RL1A225NBEA) we saw a full percentage jump from 1.7 to 2.6. Based on that alone I see no valid reason why jumping a percent in 1 year is unfeasible but doing it in two is the norm?\n\nBut hey, I'm just looking at reality. \n
I find it inevitable to American culture. We hype things up simply for the sake of it. Adding in our fierce competition and strong base in tribalism leads to seemingly innocent topics being ruined   
Compromised? For discussing with political and foreign allies? Every single allegation on Trump has fallen through from the dossier to his sex tapes to Russian influence in voting. \n\nFlynn was simply talking to Russians about sanctions that were going to happen in a time of transitioning to the new administration. In what way is America compromised by saying "if you guys don't stop fucking around in the Baltic regions then we're gonna need to do something?" \n\nAll of that is ignoring the fact of illegal wiretapping. Remember when the NSA came out admitting it wiretaps the populace? For WHATEVER FUCKING REASON people don't seem to care about that anymore. But hey, it has a chance to prove that Trump is 'a Russian ploy' what ever that means. \n\nIt's funny, msm was praising the American people for buying 1984 and learning to protect themselves against a fascist government. How did the protagonist of that novel get discovered? The TV was recording his conversations. But let's praise the CIA and NSA for doing that now 'cause I think Trump is bad for america' \n\nGive me two salient points in how he's going to be worse off for American nationals than the Obama administration. I don't want "cutting foreign ties" or subjective things like that. I want two objective and measurable, reasoned aspects, of America that will be damaged. 
Surprised you didn't call them clan members
One commits a crime the other does not
How can you make these claims without a professional supporting them? No professional has done an evaluation to attest similar accusations\n
It won't be a raise on the transition of brackets 
Teacher get asked to take down political posters and that's bad? Another teacher makes FB comments in support of her president and gets let go? 
What are you talking about, Americans riot if their sports team loses so why should we condemn others for rioting in their country?\n\n(Actual argument made)
I totally understand where you are coming from and this particular instance becomes an argument of 'is it better to do good for the immigrants or for the local population'. Simply saying moral relativism is false (which I agree with) doesn't make the general consensus of deportation/removal of illegals false as well
I don't necessarily agree with this. I don't believe they have an obligation to but rather an expectation 
But HITLER didn't like the press and I want to believe Trump is closer to Hitler than TJ!
Does it count as prostitution if someone gets the sex? 
Oh I see, you mean the comment he clarified immediately after (since he was referring to his relations as a 17yr) Or are you saying it was a "convenient misunderstanding" and he's back peddling on his statements.
Easy, just neuter our own production of uranium :^ )\n\nRussians can't steal what we don't have! 
Had to reread to understand the first part, very funny. That last line though had me in tears, was not expecting 
Idk why it's just so damn funny when Asian flags, in perfect English, drop fat red pills 
A guy makes a joke about getting raped as a kid by the church and he's somehow endorsing pedophilia? 
He should protest by tweeting more weird nudes again
Id love to show this to his fat stupid daughter
Guys guys, Putin may be based with protecting his interest but he is far from a good person. Yes he may do good things in Russia's interests and may be willing to go to lengths to collaborate a relationship with the US but he still has possible political assassinations, dirty work in the ME and Ukraine, and various others nefarious actions under his belt.\n\nThis, based on the assumption that he knew about Hillary Raping Clinton, is a good thing. But Putin has still done horrid actions 
>but Jews killed people in the Old Testament!  
This appears as though every level benefits to some degree? There is a progressive benefit trend but rich people saving more doesn't mean poor people pay more? \n\nA person making 1,000 will pay 120 income \nA person making 1,000,000 will pay 333,333 income \n\n333,333,333 > 120 BUT 33% > 12% \n\nThe difference is both people were paying more before. Some changes include death tax reform (state seizes some assets on death), and filing for defendants.\n\nRich people 'benefits more' in that the government won't literally take assets when a person dies who would otherwise distribute it fully to his family/who ever. \n\nPeople in this thread and the article make it sounds like because rich people save more, it somehow cancels out the benefits lower incomes receive. 
Wait are we still on the 'Trump is a fascist' thing? That last part threw me off
>people attack Muslims\n\nTrump is encouraging Muslim crime!\n\n>people attack Jews \n\nTrump is antisemitic!\n\n>people attack hispanics\n\nThis is what the wall brings!\n\n>people attack whites\n\nTrump is ruining the security of this nation\n\nMaybe, just maybe, people are shitty and attack each other?
And they reported because they are violent, dangerous, and threaten public safety. Especially given these riots, it's a minority group given completely free luxuries at the expense of locals. They are hosted in the country and are damaging public property for who knows what reason.\n\nNo riots are good but at least American media (for the most part) doesn't try to cover them up from the public 
>electronica\n\nImplying Mohammad wasn't dropping the sickest beats known to man 
Pissgate, Innocent Flynn, Pizzagate, Russian 'tampering' with elections, Russian 'ties' with Trump, Clean money working, etc.\n\nIs ~~god~~ Trump the cleanest President in recent history?!?
>A\n>2\n>III\n\nI swear I'll have an an aneurism all over this floor 
>wow seeing PPMD at a tournament now seems surreal\n\nThere you go buddy 
File it away for what? 
You can look around for some recent sources (I know people hate T_D but they covered this extensively) that in the past two months or so there was some 2,000 arrests made in pedophilia related situations. \n\nAnd I want to say a total of ~500 kids being rescued.\n\nEdit: it might be human trafficking in general but I know a majority of it was pedo related arrests 
Shame the game is decided by taking stocks ;)
A 7-11 employee buying a blowjob from a 40 yr old crack whore is not pizzagate. This stuff cited happened under obama too. Nothing inpressive yet.
I dont think so. The larpers have been making up arrest dates since last october. They never happen though.
Hillary had alien baby - The Globe 
Same chin
Why cant they do selfies from wherever they came from
This thing is awesome. So easy to use.
Oh you mean the illiad 2017? #Homeric
Well that escalated quickly
Daz spicey 
Still no arrests
PedostaGate
Its weird how being a retard liveral is so "in" when youre young
No need for battlestations. Its physics. They cant stop the cultural momentum anymore than we can move it forward. Its our time. No matter what.
Maybe but he needs to pay lawyers or find lawyers who work for free who think they can win the case and get paid after.
Am I the only one who doesnt find tiny trump funny? Like at all? Maybe the weakest meme of all time.
Cruz is kind of a cuck too though lets be real. Hes a DC establishment figure who successfully markets himself as the opposition to DC establishment.
Thats spicey 
How many times will we let larpers get away with acting like cia or fbi agents on pol.... of all the leaks this month how many broke on pol and how many broke in nyt/wsj/wp? (Hint 0 broke on 4chan and 10 broke in msm)\n\nThis is because pol is fake larpers. Nobody real is leaking or posting to 4chan. Anyone worth anything is leaking to legit people. Snowden didnt leak to 4chan lol. Nobody does that. Its 99% chance its a larper and 1% chance real.
Hes learning from the best! El presidente 
Wtf
Holy shit is this guy still on TV??? Had no idea.
Id rather a dictator than a shadow player like mclame
Kinda gross
Well that spicecalated quickly

I hate her so much. She son fox in a.m.
Murry me please 
This woman tackles the big problems. 
Your speculating based on something else your speculating which is predicated on another speculation, so.... not categorically impossible but not a strong theory imo... good fan fiction though
I think he was doing this before this leak
Is that a banana 
Is he running for town dog catcher?
Lol yeah all the big news guys are out cause everyone knows big news is breaking. Makes total sense.
I saw the poscast but there wasnt that much more talk about it. 5 minutes or so
He looks different in that picture 
Uhh
Love her
Who dis nigga 
Bots
Yeah but thats why we have the refugee crisis.
I think this is just money laundering and tax evasion
Leadership will do that to ya
But the very happy is the headline from article not written by assange
Lol
Oreily is for senior citizens. Bernie sucks. Miller sucks. All out of touch old establishment cucks 
Yeah but homeland

BYE BITCH!
Why does garrisom hate kissinger?
But he actually has alzehemers 
Fuck alex jones. Trump does not fucking call him.
You gotta deep down love coach B. The guy will go down in history. Epic bio.
We gotta take care of our vets
Headline: "america burns as trump whitehouse stumbles"
She sexy
John mclame
There is nothing intellectually funny about them. Not clever at all. Really surprised anyone would act like its even worthy of calling it a meme
Goes on tv the same day he gets fired and says he resigned
I thought this too but wouldnt russia value totally destabalizing the US and having people lose all hope in leaders more than a little leverage?
Blsh blah maga
I hate the illegal ones!
Fuck ben (((shaprio)))
That speaks to two things. One is trunls ability to negotiate. Two is the level of waste where somebody can talk you down a billion dollars in an hour.
Where is this from lol
Youre next
Theres none. You unfortunately just have to read everything you can and make sure you get all the pros and cons. So you have to read the washington post and you have to read breitbart and you have to read 10 more articles on the same thing. Then youll know. Trust nobody by yourself.
Maybe he can answer why hillary never got arrested like he said she would...5 times. 
Aaaand theyre growing weed
No way. Are those police cars?
Lol."Swedish" aka has lived in sweden for 7 months
Is it really a tradition if only one president did it?
No chance rush just signed a new 5 year radio deal and he isnt doing 3 hrs radio then fox news at night. He hates doing tv too.
Well to be fair saying there is a couple dozen insiders are leaking documents and trying to influence things behind closed doors is not that conspiratorial. Its common in all large organizations private or public.\n\nAs far as a consoiracy goes, its hard to compare the above with 9-11 or sandyhook, which allege vastly larger, more complicated, wide reaching, less probable of happening, less realistic, conspiracy  theories.\n\n
Woooooooo
Can we please start planting runors that he has alzehemers. We need to at least start a meme war insinuating he has alzehemers 
Why anybodys instead of somebody else?
Dont let your memes be dreams
Simple, buy a years supply of super male vitality
Love em both so much
What is thr thread url
Marry me
Petraeus but there would be a media frenzy 
What about this guys face makes him look retarded? Reminds me of sean penn face syndrome.
When was this? Thats manchester, nh
I dont see this cuck deceiving anyone
In high heels???? Is the really allowed?
Meh are we really going to trust this corn ball like he would know?
His daughter is a fat stupid cow as well.

Not going to happen unfortunately 
Summary please

Infowars also said hillary would get arrested three weeks ago so
I think i get it now.  To them nationalism=nazi.  They overlook the socialism part that they ironically fit right into
Fed ex delivers
Jeezes,  i dont even like pewdiepie.  But now I have to defend him.   Thanks shit media.  But honestly, now that I know more about him,  I've got respect
Look at these people.   Not our freinds
Give. Them. No. Quarter.
Fuccck yeah
Skill has failed them, words have failed them, and reason has failed them.
That was the most non political, real answer I've heard from a president.  It's true.  
The media wants trump to try shut them down.  They need him to act like a tyrant so they can claim the moral high ground.  They are acting like a crazy bitch who does all she can to get you to slap her so she can get you arrested.\n\n
Its like when you were a kid and you were pretend playing a gunfight.  You shoot the kid and he say " nu uh,  I'm invisible, you can't shoot me"
See yhe problem is that they make you now have to explain yourself.  Now you are arguing that you are not racist.  See the position that they try to put people in?
Cucks spreading their legs again.
This was music to my ears.
FINALLY! 
I dub this pose - the " boner killer"
Just realized that hollywood isnt just all liberal, its that liberal entertainers are pushed out onto us by the media outlets..
Lol, i think trump will have to eventually purge the left for sedition.
Maybe by sitting like this, he has cut off the oxygen to his balls.  It would explain alot.
Cnn is literally left wing tabloids now
Oh thank god.  
Oh look, its Emmanuel Goldstein
At a certain point, you're just coming off as trash.  She's really quite talented too. But pretty trashy
Some people need to learn the hard way that essentially everyone is replacable.  Tough titties
I saw a post on fb saying that trump was nominating billy grahms son?  (Why I,m never on fb.)  
Jeez, just read the comments, anti-trumpers are so stupid its terrifying.  It's pretty much fair game on any white person who likes america.  What is their problem??
This is amazing as a fan of mythology and of this sub.
Its like asking an artist not to draw charicatures.
Dude looks like a washed up little nicky. 
I was just thinking that.   It took sooo long for them to even mention it.  And then they pretty much de-legitimized that movement.  It was right after the bank bailout TARP I beleive.
Shitlord in cheif
I think real liberals need to come to their senses.  They need to expell this disease.  That means the harpy feminists, the cultural marxists, the anti-american antifa, the pandering, liar politicians and the orwellian media.  \n\nI'd love for liberals to finally wake up and come out of this fog.  Let the extremists get dealt with.  Let's have real debate.  Let's cherish our freedom to speak. \n\nI've been liberal leaning all my life and I can tell you that last year, I broke with them in all shapes and forms.  I still consider myself a liberal, but I proundly and confidently voted trump. \n\n I had no doubt in my mind that this guy was the real deal.  The more insanity that comes from the thought police, politically cucked, decadent, hollywood cock-sucking fools on the left, the more that true liberals will reject this lunacy and begin to have a real answer to the right.  Until then, the autistic screeching will be all that I hear.
Jeezus,  what the fuck is wrong with people.
Why do all sjws feel like their "voices need to be heard"  we hear you, and most of us think you're stupid.
They were pobably doing homework, securing for themselves a bright future.
For real, this is a straight up result of media propaganda.  This is what happens.  
Notice also how they dont even say his name.  Fucking loser media.
Hahaha, just the equivelant of drawing a penis on a map of the u.s.  this is a pipe dream.
Hahahah, howard was the shit.  I miss the old howard..
Jeesus man. Just wtf. It is sad
Cool clothes bro.  Nice capitalism.
Yeah, most definitely, the kkk have been irrelevant since I've been alive.  Its funny, kkk and westborough both have largely been ignored.  
Dont be afraid.  Thats how the terrorists win
Pretty much the hot topic of movements.
What a bunch of lying shit bags.  I literally hate the media right now
Scary part is that the propaganda works on the weak minded.
Someone HAS to make this into a bird flying.  With wings and everything
Then maybe he should ban himself
Hey tech companies, make an app that can suck my dick and make me a sandwich.
Trump is a dendritic t-cell
Little lord antifa
Make a definitive prediction about someone you disagree with and couch it within some other gobbldy-gook.  I fucking hate articles like this.
Whats up s.f. pede!  I live right near market and powell!  Good to know bud.  I bet there are many more like us here.
Heres the thing.  Maher is no stranger to controversy.  Lets give him credit here for even putting on the dangerous faggot.  Milo definitely delivered.  And the Joan Rivers point was spot on.  I think in a way, Maher has respect for any outspoken individuals. Even though I disagreed with him on what he said about 911 way back when the Right were just as guily of thought policing.(which got his show canceled btw)  I had to admire the stubborn conviction that he showed there.\n
Nate dirt
No wonder muslim men slap their women.
OBAMA REEEE BAT
Hey if they like 1984 they will love road to wigan peir.  Might as well read solzhenitsyn while your at it ;);)  dumb fucking trendies.  How dare they.
What in the actual fuckkkkkk?
In commie China, they literally don't allow yoga.  Chinese people have been imprisoned for it to have their organs harvested.
Cal it "leap frog" hehehehe.  Kek has willed it.
They are poking a sleeping dragon.
Im an artist by trade and i think this is great.  Goverment sponsored art is often garbage.  Hasn't always been the case of course.  Monuments, museums, etc.  Thats fine.  But oftentimes these days they are just another arm of the leftist propaganda machine.
I swear to god, these people want to ruin everything.
She is hottt
Truth.  This game is still awesome.  I played through it while my gf slept a few weeks ago.  I remembered everything.
Real eastern patriots.
How about using your platform to ENTERTAIN?  Listen to this statement.  She's being crticised for not pushing a party line.  These people are commies.  She should move to north korea.
I live in cali.  I think the only good that comes out of these riots are that all the extremists can go out there and get arrested.  Sick of these fools.  Makes everyone here look bad.  Not all of cali are like this.
Don't worry pede, we know their tricks.  I love my black patriots.  These people are just sad.
Wow, dude. Misinformation everywhere.  Scary times indeed.
She secretly wants a real man.  It's pretty obvious
So, libs and republicans join forces to expell the anarchists?  Sounds good to me ;)  
someone told me about this at work... I was like I wonder if it's fake news.
Yes!!  I think the battle between left and right should be done on an intellectual level.  The marketplace of ideas.  Thugs on both sides need to get thrown out.  Kkk and antifa.  But in order for that to happen, cooler heads must prevail.  I beleive it will happen.
The doublethink is astounding.
I love how the snswer to them is to play more games and watch more shows.  Fucking lame
Of course this is whats happening.   They keep saying "look over here, ignore those people, loookkkkk over hereeeee REEEEEEEEEEE"
Well emily goldstein, thanks for signalling to the world that you want to destroy a whole race of fellow human beings.
Lol!  Do they realize most of our trained military are made up of freedom loving patriots?
Apple cultist
If they had to get jobs, they probably would be happy, and wouldn,t b plotting to blow things up.
Hot topic- anarchy LARPing.
What if all this "white man hate" was part of a secret plan hatched by crooked hillary to get back at Bill for being a peice of shit????
God, cnn is acting like that weirdo from silence of the lambs.  "Would you fuck me?"  
Milo did great.  Remember, its just an introduction.  A little bit to salt the oats.  People will be able to look him up to get to his more meaty critiques.
No need to seperate.  We are all patriots.  Beleive what you want, stand for what you stand for, but be steadfast in the truth.  And choose your allies wisely.\n\nIm not christian either, but of the two - christianity is much, much more reformed than islam.  \n\nSo trump is standing up for christian values.  Im fine with it because christian values also tend to be western values.\n\nWe can learn alot from eachother through our love for this country and our desire to MAGA.
Hahaha i freakin love this guy
I hear ya.  It seems that since they didn't get their way, they feel the need to make anyone and everyone pay.  They always have this weird need to "make thier voices heard."  Notice, there's no intent on discussion there.  Just coating everything they do or say with a political message.
Honestly, I wouldn't try to get him fired.  Thats the classic sjw move.   But calling him out is definitely in order.
Wow, she's the angel of death.  I'm in love.
No, this guy definitely fantasizes anout punching a successful alpha in the face.
Terrorist fucks
Iron your shirt douchebag
Time to be patriots.
Redpills are flowing.
Ahh, so awesome.  It's come full circle hasn't it?
I swear, these people are possessed.
I'm sticking with cultural marxists.  But I think there should be a name for this new beast.
I think he secretly wants to be trump.  
Feminist?  Looks more like a lesbian.
What about the crime and rape?
We should do a mohammed drawing contest weekend.
Let's call it by it's name /r/retarded
RIGHT ?!?@$#@?%^
Let me get this clear, CNN actually doubts the necessity of protecting the first family ?  VERY FAKE NEWS.
The point is not the court is out of touch.   The court needs to interpret the law not make new ones or decide policies. 
You are delusional.
We've had a few of those bomb threats in upstate NY.   At the JCCs.  Which serves 85% non jews. \n
This poll is a brainwashing technique,   notice it brands Trump as bad no matter what.   Fuck this shit. \n\n
Did he cuck Trump?      WTF is this shit with women again?
I just saw on the front page a post suggesting that Trump is a racist because of that.   These people are sick sick!
She gets called to ask a questions a lot!
She did this time!
He never said anything about a terror attack. 
It is the law! MUST FOLLOW THE LAW~
The one thing Rogan is wrong is about the electronic voting.   When that goes in effect we lose our democracy. \n
I'd like a public crowd shouting death to Iran.
That wall needs to be 10 ft higher. 
Jew here.,   No way this is the work of a Trump supporter.
This is absolutely essential:\nhttps://redditenhancementsuite.com/\n\n
It's the ammonia
I don't understand,  he was part of the transition team,  is he still a private citizen? (I still don't get what the big fuss is all about)
who the fuck buys a hat at VS?   (ugly one too)
I'm not, Trump didn't say there was a terror attack yesterday....
Can't wait for the Bibi pepe. 
Perhaps, best one yet!
Can you really find all bugs?
That's not the same & and you know it.  Not that it's ok to say.
Yes that's what it means... /S.   
bawhahahahahha!!!
Would be interesting to hear what /r/TwoXChromosomes/ thinks about this... 
whats the nuclear option?
> Stockholm \n\nI see what you did there...
It's the demonize Israel Agenda. 
I hate the label human rights activist.  You can be the shittiest person alive and they'll still call you human rights activist. 
He's still a cuck. 
He fucking makes up Swedish stats and then mental gymantics it when proved wrong.  
They should pay the same car insurance then.
 I like the cat videos... I have to look....
Me too!  FOREVER!
I like how she said Milo was a homophobe...   these people are on a mission and they can't stop. 
What the hell?  WTF!?$#@%
This made me laugh out loud. I heard it in trumps voice.
The question is  like a push poll....   It suggest that Trump is bad.    \n\nFuck i hate these people.
Time traveler 
but it would've helped for the people watching who don't know any better.... 
WTF was that?
Why is this stickied :-p   
Trump is a WINNER.  He'll just work harder.
I can't wait to see how CNN makes anything out of this joint statement look bad.  oh and fucking \\r\\retarded,.
oh hey happy birthday.  doesn't matter we can't chat about that here.\n
Proud of you man.  (or woman)
We should seriously make a pool of money for whoever gives information that gets her arrested. 
But functional. 
Man that guy looks like the engineering guy.
He definitely has good delivery ... that short pause...  Genius!  
All of you who canceled netflix....   YOU SHOULD'VE done it when Full house came out and they kept mocking Trump.  I did.
Do these idiots know the difference between legal immigrants and Illegal aliens?
holly fucking shit.  Scary.
Once you're redpilled though you can't watch 5 minutes of this.   
This show is cancer.     
Yeah i was thinking about that too.  But what if you already are a citizen,  can you automatically get Israeli citizenship in the future?  (if you get it canceled)
God damn it this needs to go to the top.
NEXT.... Change Men to Women....   \nAnd Male to Female... 
Holly shit that's a lot of cars.
WE HAVE YOUR EMAIL PODESTA!!!! 
What are these reporters stupid or what?  You have the prime minister of japan standing there and they are asking questions totally unrelated.
No,  they just couldn't hide it after Trumps remarks. 
That's going to cause major economic implications.  Bad idea.   Don't shot yourself to make a point.
Seriously.  They keep pushing this narrative on the news channels as if court judges not to be criticized. 
This seriously needs to go to the top. 
That's one random person on the internet.  
NY it's automatic.  But I'll call and ask if it's possible to get it without.  (Pretty sure I asked once,  but who knows I have a different insurer this time)
Great writeup 
You're a brainwashed sheep.     Get to the facts not emotions
ah ah tnx.  Follow up question,   how does a transition team then get up to speed if they can't contact other governments?  
at least 2 hijabs too many.
plus the fucking losing left is calling to kill him on a daily basis... 
That's the title of the stupid article
You should go to Italy it exceeded my expectations. Besides Rome which I did not like at all.
That's what happens when you have a feminist parliament...   
Is this for real ?  LOLLLOOLLL
I'd like my pay in liberal's tears.
The MAD MAN!!!     
As should be with your vote.  You seriously don't see the irony?
Go back and check the family tree.... I missed that the first time... :-)
I'm personally very conflicted in the whole health insurance issue.  On the one hand all government employees, army, vets, get covered by the government.  Then to that add Medicaid.  and Medicare...   What the hell is left?   only maybe 50% of the people between ages 18-65.\n\nI'm leaning towards combining all programs, and expanding it to all CITIZENS (not illegals)\n\n\nAny thoughts on this?\n\nOne thing for sure it's not a clear cut this is better than the other. \n\n
he's fucking killing it.
OMG,   my ribs.    VERY FAKE NEWS
It's TRUE!
you have an index of other channels ?!
Now that I can believe!
There's a difference.  We don't say DEATH TO IRAN.
Fuck him that segment was pure cancerous venom. 
so not funny
That was bigly amazing.
not if their entire platform was womens rights?    i'm still shocked that you can have a law mandating head cover. \nAlso i hate the fact that you're being down-voted for expressing an opinion. 
Brought me to tears.  Bravo.
They even work on Holidays. SAD!
wtf is going on? 
Yes I saw a shadow, I ended up watching a 57 sec clip on youtube, I did not hear her say skippy though, is there another video thats longer more clear?
I've seen a video on how these guys "flirt." Its just them saying  "let's fuck." over and over again
not to mention they were chanting Allah Snakcbahr at the immigration protest in NEw York and praying in the street
This is the most Swedish news story
Yes that "gunman"
LMAO\n
I wouldn't mind liberal women wearing burkas too, so its easier on the eyes.
I've got a i7 4790k and GTX 970 that I bought two years ago, im not buying a new graphics card until theres one that can do 4k at 60 fps\n

Who in their right mind like watching rich actors giving each other awards
This plus he was recently pranked called as someone posing as the Ukrainian Prime Minister
I want this whole crime syndicate taken down immediately!!!!!
Trump: "Tomorrow the headline on cnn will be 'Trump Lashes and Raves at Press'"
But NOTHING HAPPENED FRIDAY NIGHT! Gosh!
not only did they find the passports I remember they were near perfect condition, watching the MSM on that day in seventh grade is when I was redpilled
Sharia is the only law to them and should but on all lands
The Alderman Thomas Katsiantonis case has to do with financial crimes, possbily money laundering through his restaurants, I don't know if it has anything to do with child trafficking at this point.
Its not a riot they are just having a bonfire using cars
Then what did John Podesta, Anthony Weiner, Lena Dunham, Sarah Silverman, and Bill Clinton do to the DNC?
Only a 0.3% success rate, thats what I call PROGRESS
They are destroying this planet let them keep and give us the 7 new planets
The main question is does the guy look like Podesta like people claim 
All white people look the same, and all white people are Nazi's, haven't you learned anything from 2016???
I was soo pissed that he lost that I threw a trash can through a starbucks window....NOT!
I heard rumors a while back that everything wrong with the media can be traced back to soros
yes newegg.com has some great deals now\n\nEDIT: https://promotions.newegg.com/gigabyte/17-0833/index.html?cm_sp=Cat_Video-Cards-Video-Devices-_-gigabyte%2f17-0833-_-https%3a%2f%2fpromotions.newegg.com%2fgigabyte%2f17-0833%2f1920x360.jpg&icid=387924
Im not interested in watching this shit if it isn't 100% proof its podesta. Have you watched all of them ?
YES! I was there for his campaign rally on Oct 10 but couldnt get in because the line was too long
Its common knowledge that the best deals are made over dinner or on the golf course, not in conference rooms
So many Snowflakes
The whole MSM has turned into "Bagdad Bobs" over Sweden 
I hope he does a talk about Pizzagate, he was supposedly threatened to not talk about it, was he threatened with that video?
I wrote in Ron Paul, and I remember liberals were calling me "a racist McCain supporter since I didnt like Obama"
not sure, didnt he say he would double the budget?\n
People on my facebook feed are screaming "Impeachment" for what? Is there anything of substance in these latest claims?\n
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quU_Tbv96Wk
Obama cut NASA funding bigly, heard rumors Trump wants to give NASA $19 Billion
Do you really "shortly see his face" in one video?\n
"Is that a Baguette in your pocket or are you happy to see me?"
Couldn't have said it better myself, you and I align very similarly, I too supported Rand (I voted for Ron Paul in 2008 and 2012) and knew that if Rand wasn't the Republican nominee Trump would be the next best thing, if not better.
for me 10, havent been this into politics since 2007
they are still picking up all those hillary votes
I hope the Lake has acquired the proper permits before flooding the neighboring towns.
Didn't they do the same thing to Sarah Palin and the hospital where Prince Charles and princess Kate had her baby?
And water is wet
Yes THis thank you!
I think shes afraid that it will spill and she'll drown
Just because it caused a resignation of a Trump white house official the media thinks they won and will milk this to the end of time with still no evidence.....to sum up, everyone who voted for Trump is a Nazi and everyone who wants to have better relations with Russia, a nuclear power, is a russian spy....
lol I read "Twenty-Four Hours Later.." in the spongebob voice
Sounds to me like they are victim blaming\n
Hillary Clintons Private server was hacked very easily...You are giving too much credit to these dumbasses
He helped Democrats win in 2008 lol
I went to the Melbourne Rally last week hoping he would talk about NASA since a lot of people here work for the space agency
Lol "Best thing since Nov 7th" what was so great about Nov 7th?
Posted a few
Also can someone cross examine the hands of the person in the video with Podesta showing the fish and 14 on his hands picture?\n\nI remember Podesta had bandages and scars on his hands
Im tired of all the smugness of the left, they are spreading video of Hillary from the second debate "warning" everyone about it.
I'm fine with that if and only if they accept just as many christians fleeing as muslims and that the "children" coming in are not bald and have full grown beards
I guess she's hoping her viewers dont know what youtube is
I am going to see him in Melbourne!
Fuggin lol Dr Pepe
yes regardless of who that is in the video I definitely agree those people need to found and brought to justice
Here's the youtube channel: https://www.youtube.com/user/DearWhitePeople/about\n\nEveryone go and report them for promoting racism
Alternate Headline :"The Mental Illness Epidemic"
Does anyone else think how scary it is that a private citizen has soo much access to people in our government
He's a simple solution, if you want Sharia Law go to a country where it is the law, stop trying to impose it on us!
One 1080 ive seen get close to 40 fps in some games but averages at 30 fps for 4k. If you dont have a 4k monitor dont get a 1080 right now, not worth it.

I think they are just spy satellites
Mike Flynn's son was tweeting about #pizzagate and she blames him for that guy going into comet ping pong with a gun....she's taunting him now since he had to resign.
During the campaign I really loved the "failed businessman" argument. When does being worth $9.5 billion considered "failing." \nAlso turning $1,000,000 to $10 billion isn't a piece of cake either, its like investing $1 and getting a $10,000 return, the mans a business God imo
You'll find Jimmy Hoffa before you find LePen in a hijab
EDIT: http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/02/14/kim-jong-uns-older-brother-killed-north-korean-spies-poison1/\n\nHe was poisoned by a "female North Korean Spy" lol
Yes I totally agree, it was bound to happen to the "fat bear" sooner or later
lol California high speed rail is such a joke, they are taking high speed rail technology that Europe has been using for the last 20+ years and it will be ready in California to use in what 8 years from now? I wish they would invest all that money into hyperloop or maglev
Same, I saw a lot of sikhs wearing american flag turbans
Yes I couldn't agree more
I don't think so, he was the original successor to Kim Jong Il but he was such an embarrassment to the family he was pretty much exiled. I would not be surprised if Kim Jong Un killed him.
As long as Gorsuch gets confirmed I dont really give a hoot
We found out the hard way when my wife's ssn was stolen and used
I believe so
What is Shariablue?
fuck it sounds very similar to Podesta but you cant 100% prove it, either way that child is being tortured and whoever is doing it needs to have his and his whole family killed.
thanks for the update
She blames Mike Flynn and his son for spreading the #pizzagate "rumors" and was the reason that guy went into Comet Ping Pong with a gun. To me it looks like shes just taunting him saying "I got away again"
Wow its almost as bad as UC Berkley
lol GTX 1080 is about $600 now!
Isn't this grounds for removal from the Senate?
I don't know if I want to see it, do you actually see the child in this video or just hear more screaming?
I'm starting to think the left loves starting fires....dont they know what it will do to global warming????
Voted to Oppose\n
Wow, what a quick reversal in who-gets-fucked-up!
"one which is common (violent, drunk men) and one which is not (violent, sober men)"\n\nSober rape seems much more common among muslim men
"LET'S SEE HOW R/ALL FEELS ABOUT CENSORSHIP!"\n\nUh...pro.  They are pro-censorship.  Is there any liberal who isn't against hiding criticism from themselves and others?
It could pay off by lessening their influence on national tax revenue.
I hope that's just the British way to spell oppose...
What?  I already deleted facebook months ago...
Yeah, I stepped back from NFL this year and watched hockey for the first time.  There's a lot to understand about the game, but I don't miss the NFL... I figured I'd wait to see how they were after Trump's election so I could see whether they were just front-running, but I think we have our answer.  \n\nI'll probably hold off on watching until halftime and I'll read about what was said/done before deciding whether to tune in for the second half.  So strange how much more there is to life when you quit facebook and don't have all of your fall Sundays spoken for!
Yeah, you wouldn't have a situation like Tattoo-gate in, say, Columbus, for example.
I'd like to get a filter that only shows his tweets.  I don't use twitter much because they are a shitbag company, but the unfiltered access to his positions is excellent.  \n\nBTW, as things heat up, I would imagine Twitter will pull some fuckery so it would make sense for him to have a backup direct platform...
Tell me who it is so I don't have to give them a click...
Is CTR spamming us with blank memes?
So do I need to switch to Droid?
Yeah, we need to stop acknowledging when Dems think they've "taken down" somebody.  Everyone on both sides (the neo-con/neo-lib side and the based side) knows that this is bullshit.  Why pretend anything actually changed?  Of course CPAC fucked up, but don't hold grudges against allies.  Libs are still disingenuous racists and we're still against corruption, be it media, government, social media, shadow government, etc.  Let them continue to be the party of hate and intolerance and we'll continue to be the party where ideas matter more than "identity".  I literally don't even see the bullshit and only know when CNN/NYT/MSNBC type companies have propagandized something new when it shows up on T_D.
"one *attempted* rape"\n\nhuh?  Sweden is the rape capital of the world and the muslim refugee capital of the world.  Most of the rapes are committed the muslim refugees.  According to their religion, muslims cannot drink, but can rape.  Hence, "sober rapists".\n\nYour angle seems to be an effort to blur the clear causal relationship between the increase in rape in Sweden and the increase in muslim immigrants who commit most of the rapes.  Outside of facilitating more rape, I can't understand the point of that objective.
I know who she voted for...
We need an alternative to the silicon valley social media companies.  There isn't a less free-thinking part of the world this side of Mecca and they have no moral objections to censorship and racial hate.  We need a phoenix to rise from the ashes of social media.
I was agreeing.  No need to remove your comment.
Fortunately for us, this only takes away jobs from lazy, overqualified hipsters.
According to Gallup polls, that reflects a 7% drop in the President's Approval rating.  Remember, it's illegal to gauge support for the President yourself, so Gallup will tell you what's in it...
Where have you been?
Was this forcible rape or were they dating?  I wouldn't want my daughter having sex at 14 but that would make a world of difference, nonetheless.\n
I sent a note to "feedback@pizzahut.com" letting them know I won't patronize as long as they keep their association with pedophilia supporter George Takei.
Listened to that on the way to work.  Incredible the lengths MSM will go to intentionally distract and discredit.
"kiiiinda associated with white supremacists"\n\nedit:  Haha, made a joke about oboe being the chick in the picture and then saw her explaining twice on a 9-comment thread that it's a "chelsea cut"\n\n
Well, I know one of the prosecutors on the tat guy - the investigation was unrelated to the tattoos, and none of the prosecutors nor investigators cared at all what punishment the NCAA doled out - Which was supposedly the result of Tressel reaching out to a mentor instead of the NCAA when he found out.  Columbus is a big city, but there is a ton of support for Ohio State.  I doubt any other city it's size has such a monopoly on college sports fandom.  \n\nThat said, it's probably a mix of being too big of a city to contain the story (why it broke) and how many people were interested in hurting the program (why the punishment was so incongruous).
I know who he voted for
This.  My buddy was talking shit to this big ass dude at the bar and when he finally got up to "do something about it" I hit him in the back of the head with a cue ball.  Fair fights are for old people.
...This is one place...in North America...Specifically, it's Mexico.
haha, more like Republicans have the Presidency, the House, the Senate, the state Senates, and the state Houses after Dems spent a billion dollars on a failed campaign.\n\nNow Soros has to pump millions of dollars into ShareBlue to make you retards think you're winning something, only it didn't work, so reddit still has to hide subs, reset vote counters, ban users, etc...\n\nI left the Democratic party because they turned into intolerant, racist, religious bigots obsessed with protecting themselves from free speech.  Now I feel like that guy who got out of his car right before it exploded in a gas fire.
Yeah we haven't even caught up for the boycott yet.  I got my wife a $50 card before this crap.  Since pitching it would just help their margins, I'm sure there are others waiting to boycott.  
But they are going to anyway and everyone knows that.  It would make no difference if the front page of CNN/NYT was "Milo Caught Fucking Baby" for a decade because they only have credibility with leftist bigots.  I don't understand it.
Should have thought of that before you decided to live in LA with all those retarded assholes.
Yeah, I was there 12 years ago and again 8 years ago and it was noticeably more dangerous then.  I was threatened by a muslim guy directly under the Eiffel Tower.  On the same trip, in Amsterdam, a car pulled over to warn me not to keep biking down the street I was on (near the canal area) because I was heading towards an area that was unsafe for whites, specifically.  No reason to go to those dumps now.  Their populations failed them by being too afraid to criticize the influx of violent, racist middle easterners who barely hid their intent to destroy the cities.  It's a powerful warning about not standing up to the evil cowards who want to silence Americans on the same topic until it's too late.  I would join a militia well before any of our cities began to look as shitty as Paris is currently.  Detroit is a place on that trend, for example.  I'm not saying Detroit is as shitty as Paris, but for an American city, it's pretty shitty.
It's Valentine's Day for godsake.  You could have flipped it and made the front page!  Oh, wait.  I see what you did.
"Everyone" isn't.  By approval polls, a higher percentage of people are happy with what he's done than the percentage of people who voted for him when he said he was going to do it.
Great sense like this got us here.
I would suggest watching them on periscope.  You can completely take the middleman out and watch the events unfold.  I was amazed watching feeds from Berkeley not because of the people being maced or hit with poles, which unfortunately has occurred at a lot of the recent protests, but at the huge groups of people chanting "Kill Trump Supporters" and cheering the violence.
Well it's not like you'd just give them any American military property or personnel there, but I take your point.
*white Americans
Well, you still need to say it.  People with shitty morals have success when they screech louder.  If that's what's effective, that's what we need to do.\n\nfeedback@pizzahut.com
I did but it doesn't offer any indication
"Publicly funded" doesn't give you some special rights over the owners or commissioners of the study.  That's not how taxes work.  If the government wants to commission a study on whether gangbangkang is a pedophile, they don't have to show it to you just because they required you to help pay for it...
Only instead of guys in tri tip hats it's hoards of migrant rapists...
Look, we have seen this time and time again this year.  It's time to bring in the national guard to control these violent protesters.  Also, we know where they are going to be.  When legal, bring your guns and don't be afraid to use them.
Yes, I would submit that the CNN stories are completely biased.  Think of it this way:  If there was a Clinton rally and a bunch of Republicans showed up and it escalated to violence, do you think CNN would blame "violent Clinton rallies"?  \n\nI'll take your point on the pizzagate guy (even though he didn't harm anyone - When the protester at UW fired, it was into a person).  The Pizzagate guy can probably be lumped in the Trump camp, though that's a very bizarre story that I don't think I fully understand.\n\nI also wasn't grouping European and Canadian antifa or other terrorists in with American voters and I wouldn't lump a French Canadian terrorist in with American voters.\n\nWhile I'll give you the pizzagate guy despite thinking he's a lone mentally-disturbed attacker who didn't actually attack anyone, I'd ask you to compare that to the violence and intimidation being used against civilians in the pursuit of political gains at "protests" all over the country, many of them hosting *actual* violence
Oh no!  I'm so concerned with this!
Totally.  It makes way more sense to pretend this abuse victim supports pedophilia when everyone knows it's bullshit than to look into a potential human trafficking ring.\n\nImagine being such a brainwashed piece of shit that you think an out of context comment is more worthy of your fake outrage than actual pedophilia.\n\n
Those weren't the muslim rape hoards then.  They *never* wait in line or pay the fees.  Sounds like you didn't get robbed, though!  Way better luck than I had the last two times I was there.  Paris sucks now.

I'd like to think I enhanced it by picking up Horton's for my client this morning.  I don't know that they are much better, but I know they hang out with based Wendy's....

Don't forget Teavana, Seattle's Best and Tazo are subsidiaries!
We have to be more effective at punishing anti-white racists, regardless of how they couch their hatred.  Simply boycotting anti-white companies is not enough.

Oh.  I don't know if that's ridiculous, though.  Isn't a Swedish cop being charged with a hate crime for criticizing muslim refugee crime?
...by resulting in higher tax revenue and lower expenditure...
I already contacted them using this form.  I suggest you all do the same.  The school's racist parents have been rewarded for their hatred of whites.  It's unacceptable.\n\nhttp://www.collierschools.com/Page/155
What is the difference between discrimination and "reverse" discrimination?  
I had no idea how stupid average Swedes are before they started saying things on the internet.
Totally.  In 20 years I wouldn't be surprised if Sweden and Germany were as peaceful as Syria.
More like the media is gaslighting America.  When you can watch videos on periscope of Berkeley Antifa beating an unconscious man with a shovel and then wake up to a headline about "protests" successfully keeping away a speaker who would "incite violence"...\n\nOr, in a broader sense, when you know for a fact you have yet to see a violent Trump supporter, yet you are constantly barraged with the idea that violence against Trump supporters is excusable because of how evil they are. 
Le Pen on your way out!
This is pretty standard among folks remaining on the left.  They happily (okay angrily) justify the violence because they are too self-aggrandizing to ever admit to themselves that they were part of a cowardly and evil movement.
>"Let me see if I can make this whole experience exponentially worse"\n\n"...for the guy who was about to destroy me"
The mayor should also be charged with murder here.  Anybody have an update on that bill?
The argument is that "scientists" oppose an open debate.  I personally believe humans have some impact, but their projections always say we're 20 years from disaster and obviously it's never true.  If you want to know whether something is true, look at the people saying it. In this case, it's the people who censor opposing opinions, make education into race-hate indoctrination and light people on fire when they support the president.  
That's exactly what I took it to mean...What's the fake-ish part?
I think he means they are setting the stage so that whenever you search for Reality Check Pizza Gate, you'd find any version of the story that CNN did instead of his original.
Lessening support a range of counter-productive liberal agenda items.  For instance, whereas liberals prefer to fill educational and workplace roles based on identity, the ideological balance could be tipped back to merit-based roles, increasing productivity.\n\nAlso, when considering the tax revenue of southern California, you should also consider expenditure, reducing the amount that would have to be "made up".  Many products created there are used by people who would remain Americans, meaning they could face import taxes.  There could be a fed export charge for their water.  It would take a combination of things to replace the money, but reducing support for liberal policies would help lots of places increase workforce participation, in my opinion.
Oh no, a private sector solution??  \n\nBetter than taxing some guy who couldn't afford to go to college so he can pay for some kid whose been brainwashed to hate him to go and learn how to fuck him over more with a The Problem With Being A Fucking Privileged White Male degree.
Since you asked, I just sent an email to Collier schools condemning them for their racism.  The reassignment was the result of her being white with an opinion and done to appease racist parents at Parkside.\n\nhttp://www.collierschools.com/Page/155
Whoa that's a lot of ankle out of the one on the right!  
Magic.
Just tried to create a twitter profile.  In my description I mentioned diversifying northern Africa and the Middle East to fight the bigotry and intolerance there.  My account was locked before my first post and demanded my phone number to unlock it.  Twitter dox.\n\nedit:  I think I figured out what it is.  I just made another account and as soon as I suggested fighting intolerance in Africa and the Middle East by diversifying them, it was blocked again.  Twitter is actively fighting diversity.
It has excellent natural resource of its climate and ports, the aforementioned military and peripheral businesses also due to location, myriad private businesses in addition to ample foreign investment.  \n\nDespite those inherent aids, it's still hindered by the same things as many liberal cities:  Economic inequality from short-sighted assistance programs/some of the highest rates of homelessness in America, a wasteful mess of a government because liberals expand government to usurp more money and power, poor education system and economic instability since [half of the entire state's revenue comes from the capital gains and income tax of 1% of the population](https://shastalantern.net/2016/05/50-of-californias-income-tax-revenue-comes-from-1-of-residents/)
Hahahaha.  "Militant libertarian" who supported W...and hates free speech...\n\nWas it supposed to say "middle-aged librarian"?
These guys are still around?
The city of Cincinnati isn't really all that tied to OSU (at least nothing like Cleveland and Columbus), but yeah, you'll have the non-conformists who deliberately choose to root for a border team/rival like Michigan, MSU, Penn State, Notre Dame but for the most part Ohio college students root for Ohio State in addition to their own school.  I think UC is the exception, though, and they desperately want to be a big enough program to have their own independent fan base.
"nothing would happen to Clemson/any larger program"\n\n...in the South.  Up here you can negate 12+ wins, a sugar bowl, lose a shot at a bowl game after an undefeated season, lose 5 players and have your head coach fired if you fail to tell the NCAA your players traded signatures for tattoos...
"your country is being mocked worldwide"\n\nLOL.  By who?  Angela Merkel?  The Swedes?  Brits?  *Who*, exactly, do you think has the standing to say the US is fucked?  Seriously.  America is not in a position to appease quickly-declining nations that weren't our peers in any sense before their declines.  America First won because the American people realized that emulating lesser nations was only bringing us down.  That's over now, and no amount of cowards crawling out of their parents' basement to attack free speech will change that.

This is also indirectly the case with university funding (and any student loan forgiveness), as well.
There is no such thing as "reverse" discrimination or racism.  That would just mean "not discrimination" or "not racism", which isn't the case.

Ahsoka would fit nicely in an Obi Wan movie
They dont realize the shit posts only make us stronger 
Yeah makes sense. I need to rewatch it I feel like I missed so much and I've watched 4 times
I understand the point you're making but to me this seems like just a clickbait title rather than a threat against his life 
Fuck you u/spez
What scares me is that is exactly what the people at the top want. Its a whole lot easier to control 1 or 2 billion people than 7 billion. 
Muslims kill for their faith, Christians die for their's
Filoni has made it pretty clear that Ahsoka's story won't be continued in Rebels
How did he tweet that 4 hours from now??
There is an undercover battle going on for the soul of America, have you not been watching your daily dosage of Alex Jones?

Any idea where you can listen to the soundtrack from this episode?
Exactly plus dunbar is coming off an acl injury.. You don't disregard a potential pro bowl rb just cause you already have running backs on your roster....
Don't let the left hand know what the right is doing.

I like to imagine William is really just Liam McPoyle taking a vacation 
We have the cutest girls the absolute cutest 
This entire season was built around Ezra slowly turning to the dark. I don't think they will throw away all the work they have done with his character and just have him walk away and become a farmer....
Wd
Id recommend every episode. Even though some of storylines are childish and seem pointless, the way the characters react and develop throughout the entire series is amazing.
An hour long Zeb honor guard special in between seasons 2-3 would be fantastic. Im afraid a zeb flashback in a season would be hard storytelling wise
SHIT POSTING STRAIGHT TO THE OVAL OFFICE

Man, I should've guessed he's a Longhorn. Hook em #MakeLonghornsGreatAgain
And you don't think they would trade any of those other rbs away? If they think Zeke is a rb that can 1,500 yds a year, take pressure off Romo, and keep a shitty defense off the field I think it makes perfect sense 
Of course you post a gay frog

TRUMP TRAIN CONFIRMED! MEME MAGIC KNOWS NO BOUNDS
It all went downhill once Galloway retired 
Thank you!!
He said it would be released Thursday and involves the news org. President Trump talks about the most 
Who would we make that trade with? Cleveland wants to trade out of 8 so it seems a team like Miami could jump in there and take Elliot, so we would have to trade for a pick before then. Would Jax, Bal, or SF want to make that deal? 
This is silly, he didn't risk his career. He hurt his knee  and sat out for a couple weeks. He is still one of the best defensive centers in the league and will probably be traded to a championship contender in the next couple months. 
Blue Ruin
Seeing him walk out on that balcony with the huge "Donald Trump elected 45th President of the United States" banner at the bottom is a moment I'll never forget. Getting chills just writing this 
This poll only has a sample size of 2,148. Thats too small to get an accurate pulse of the country. As much as we trashed CNN and co for phony polls we have to call out Fox when they do the same thing. Lying benefits no one, just report the truth
Problem is Kota is old EU, Rogue One and Rebels are both canon. They happen in the same universe so Rogue One can't have a "Kanan like" character becuase the actual Kanan already exists. If that makes any sense...
Yeah that makes a lot of sense... I think im blocking the idea of Ahsoka going to the dark side from my mind because its way too much to handle.
In my town, a young girl was killed by her cousin who was an illegal immigrant. He had been arrested for assault and deported once before. I'll buy 10 for her

Plus we are going to have the leagues best rushing attack for the next 5+ years to extended Romo's career and ease his replacement in

He actually did make a $300 billion deal with Russia but sanctions against them made it so they couldnt go through with the deal. He was also awarded the Order of Friendship by Putin. Im not saying the media is right to over play the Russian card, but in this case they look to be right. 
I saw that and love that idea! It would be pretty easy to fit into the story and still makes sense too. 
Grade A shitpost. Well done

In Rhode Island people think that the mafia killed Kennedy because the mob helped him get elected, then he started the whole RICO thing (basically designed to put guineas in jail) and declared war on the mob. They decided to "withdraw" him from office. I don't know if that's what happened but that's what people around here think and I some of them would be a reliable source for info on those kinds of people. \n\nI know the magic bullet thing is bullshit though, one bullet penetrated kennedy and then hit connelly. LHO was the only shooter, that's beyond dispute; [this makes that clear](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NPrzCGVi3_E). \n\nI think the conspiracy is in who got LHO to do it. That being said, there's no reason he wouldn't have been able to do that alone. It wasn't that hard to do tbh.

The first shot missed, the second shot was low but went through his back, and the third shot hit him in the head. There were three casings found in the book depository. There is no evidence of another shooter. There is no reason to believe there should have been another shooter. The conspiracy is who put the sniper, LHO, up to it.

You gotta be careful because on one hand, people lie on there (aka larping). On the *other* hand, some really interesting people go there to break stories. If you want to know more about the smear campaign, look into Evan McMullin. He's the guy that organized it. 
Oh right. Yes, just like that.
I'm gonna be cynical here and say that they're silent because they don't know and the mods delete everything having to do with islamic violence unless it's so bad that they can't delete it anymore which has happened a few times on here with things like the Bataclan massacre or belgium.

What does Mexico do with illegal immigrants?
They censor keywords I guess. I'm not sure exactly how it works but Mark Zuckerberg (Facebook) has agreements with some governments to censor people mentioning islam or mass immigration.

>I don't know if I believe him or not\n\nI'm not defending child abuse. The way it looks to me is that a sexual predator went after him. \n\nYou're victim blaming a child who was raped by a 29 year old. See, I can make horrible accusations based on little to nothing as well.\n\nHoly shit. I found a shill in the wild. You've been busy. You wrote: "“No, no, no. You’re misunderstanding what pedophilia means. Pedophilia is not a sexual attraction to somebody 13 years old who is sexually mature. Pedophilia is attraction to children who have not reached puberty."\n-Milo Yiannopoulos, Jan 4th, 2016\n13 year olds are children. Legally, intellectually and sexually. They are children." \n\nin half a dozen different subs. Is that allowed or do you have to put effort into it to get paid?
It's so hard to know now because there are so many, but they all seem to do the same stuff. $40 million buys a lot of astroturfing. That's not even the corporate shills which are even more numerous.

The era of cognitive dissonance is over.
I think betas hate alphas. They hate that he speaks plainly and doesn't prepare a whole bullshit speech, then spend the next twenty minutes joking around with the press while they blow him. This is what actual change looks like. Obama was absolutely full of shit. I regret voting for him, I regret *working* for him. Trump is the real deal and the republicans and democrats are doing everything they can do to maintain power against this third option. \n\nAlso, you are entirely disingenuous when you say, "OMG, he literally said "the best thing I could do would be to bow that Russian ship out of the water,". He said he's not gonna tell us because he'd be telling them. He spent a few minutes explaining it but you're acting like CNN by taking a sentence and making it all about that sentence. Why not talk about how he said this about his response, https://youtu.be/jL3yF9wYR3U?t=3524 ?

>Officers attended the scene at a remote south Texas ranch, near to the Mexico border, in early January, finding the two men bleeding from gunshot wounds. A second guide was involved in the incident, but escaped without injury. \n\nThe casualties, guide Walker Daughtery, 26, and client Edwin Roberts, 59, and the other guide, Michael Bryant, told police they suspected the shooters were undocumented immigrants they had seen on the ranch earlier in their trip.\n\nIt's scary down there. They're not just talking about run of the mill illegal immigrants. That's drug trafficking territory. Ranchers get murdered on their land because of actual incidents. The headline makes it look like a baseless fear. 
Who the hell is 23 and hangs out with a 16 year old and an 18 year old torturing a turtle as if they are 9 years old. There is a certain amount of time when kids are young and that kind of retardation is permissible; barely. As adults though, give me a break. There's something in the water. 
A smear campaign means that a group of people decided on a media pusche simultaneously to have maximum effect. It doesn't have anything to do with whether something is true or not. I believe him when he says he doesn't feel like he was molested, just like George Takei, but I'm not ok with the fact that he was definitely molested. If my kid was predated by a 29 year old I'd be pretty angry even if he was 17. 
Oooooh no. Here we go.\n\nBuilding 7. What's up with that?
The exit wound is where his head "explodes". I've talked to people that think that's the entry wound, thinking the initial force is explosive and then zips out the back, but that's not how it works. The bullet enters the back of his head and exits (explodes his skull) out the front.

That's a recent epiphany I had. The global elites need to disarm us so they can brutalize us with mass migration while they live in gated communities or on their own islands. They never would have been able to do what they did to those European countries if the people were better armed. Woman could shoot attempted rapists and retake the night. Families could protect their homes from rapists and murderers coming off the street. 
Those pyramids look identical to mountain peaks.. If they were pyramids then they'd also be a mile tall or more. I don't buy that part. \n\nOn thing I do think is pretty cool, something to think about, is the Piri Reis map from a few hundred years ago that shows land masses that we thought no one knew about yet were apparently sourced from even more ancient maps. I don't know much more than that but it's pretty cool to think about.

Thanks for the info.
They don't know *anything* about islam. They just know that conservatives aren't fans so they think they can use them for "progressive" ends. It's why they flooded European countries with them. The leftists think they can use them to antagonize their political opponents. It only took a few years for these leftist governments to destroy what took over a thousand years of defence and vigilance against islam. They let them right in through the front door so they could be used to brutalize their own people. Fuck these "feminist"/leftist governments. People will look back on them as the people that destroyed the world and that is not hyperbole. It will take a titanic effort to reverse this error.
I was thinking about the whole "parsec" thing from star wars where people deride the scriptwriters for throwing in a sciencey buzzword that's well known enough to be spotted (a parsec is a distance! Not a measure of time!) and I found a way to excuse it. \n\nHan Solo is a smuggler. He says that with the Millennium Falcon, he was able to do the Kessel run in less than something something parsecs. That could just mean that instead of zigzagging from system to system, he was able to make a beeline for the destination with the cargo. He's saying that his operation doesn't fuck around.

Close. It was invented by Shia muslims so they could pretend to be sunni muslims and not get genocided. Thy decided that it would be alright to lie and gain knowledge of some sunni customs (numbers of times they pray each day, who they thought succeeded muhammad etc) and not be seen as straying away from being shia because they were lying to protect themselves. This is still necessary today actually and one example is that in ISIS areas where they were pulling people off the highway and out of their homes and quizzing them on sunni customs then executing those that weren't sunni. 
Their government is feminist. They think the biggest threat to sweden is swedish men. They're also obsessed with American style identity politics and think that they are the mothers of all non-europeans who they see as weak babies who need to be brought it and nursed. They're absolutely fucked because there isn't a single person in power who isn't a weak snob.

When a woman in a wheelchair was locked in a bathroom and repeatedly raped by 5 migrants over and over again, she escaped and the police came. They let them go because they said they didn't do it and their lawyer claimed that she didn't fight back hard enough so that must mean consent. She was beaten as well. A protest from the local community sprung up to condemn the police and the courts. The media branded them as "neo-nazis" for this. Their media is cucked beyond belief. 
Was he invited to them? I keep waiting and waiting for Corey Feldman to blow the lid off of it like he's promised by he still hasn't. I think he's probably afraid. According to him and Elijah Wood, they're fucking everywhere.

Share Blue spends $40 million to astroturf sites like reddit with leftist shills. [Reddit admins/mods know this and have been exposed for it](http://imgur.com/a/gKqfE). This makes it almost impossible to know who's a real person and who is paid to attack trump. This site is getting rediculous and it makes me kind of sad that you can't tell who's lying and who's a real person. 
Well, he talked about how he was 13 or something and had sex with a 20 something year old. Someone said, how could you give consent? And he maintained that he thought he was the one pursuing it. I don't know if I believe him or not but I don't think this is what people are making it out to be. [Here is a guy from a conservative journo-list (an email list of dozens of journalists that coordinate their stories in order to have a bigger impact on reporting and assuaging the public if they're not aware of the concerted effort behind it all. He told people to be aware of this upcoming story and it ended up happening the next day so I'm willing to believe him.)](http://imgur.com/a/VX8r0)

They're so astroturfed that anyone below the age of 50 knows that they're up to something at the very least. People on youtube or with podcasts (people like Gavin M, Milo, Rubin, Sargon) are all kicked so much ass compared to CNN and Wash post. They can commit to their narrative as much as they want but the actual people in the country know they're full of shit. I live in a really poor city. I never hear people bitching about trump. In fact, I often hear people talking about him in the positive. This is a war between the Trump, the people vs the establishment and what can be called "the deep state". We're going to win if we don't let up.
I don't think a lot of people know that Trump *is* the alternative. The republicans and democrats aren't trying to take him down because he's one of them. He self funded his way into the white house with nothing but his wealth and millions of voters and when they told him that he had to do what they said, he told them not only o fuck off but that they were going down. They're flailing right now and using everything at their disposal to get him out of there so they can continue plundering the country like usual. They're using astroturfing online, in the streets, they're using useful idiots (upper class suburban white kids), they're using rogue cia and fbi agents. This is really bad but not for the reasons the MSM will tell you. Trump isn't the problem. The government is the problem. Trump said everything he truly believes at the inauguration. He's the real fucking deal and they're going to kill him for it. Presidents almost never get far trying to take down the corrupt establishment but maybe this time it'll work.
Yes. Youths..

They suppress stories like that in a pretty sophisticated way where people can't find stories at all rather than blocking them outright like they do in China. [Here is how they block stories about immigration policy in Sweden and there is something similar in Germany.](https://imgur.com/lGIQkZZ)\n\nMainstream outlets downplay the problems with immigration in Europe because it plays into the hands of rightwing parties. They'd rather continue fucking up than admit they fucked up. That's standard, but this is a particularly egregious fuck up. Entire neighborhoods, hundreds across cities in France, Germany, UK, and Sweden are off limits to police and outsiders and the barrier to entry was so lenient that they've seen a significant increase in violent/sexual crime. It's gotten so bad in a lot of places that it's impossible for anyone aware of it to ignore yet this is downplayed and people are made to feel shamed for recognizing that this is not normal. Why? \n\n[Some police have begun to speak out about this insane state of affairs and have received widespread support from Swedes that have lived in these kinds of conditions](http://www.zerohedge.com/sites/default/files/images/user230519/imageroot/2017/02/07/2017.02.07%20-%20Sweden%201_0.JPG). Crimes such as gangrape and grenade attacks were nearly nonexistent, they're now commonplace. People have criticised those talking about the increase in gun crime and bombings/grenade attacks because they're "mostly isolated to immigrant communities" but I think that's fucked up because it's still happening on European soil. This issue, more than any other, has caused me to seriously doubt what mainstream outlets and leftist politicians say, and don't say, about these issues that will impact the continent for the next hundred years after just a few years of mass migration. They seriously seriously fucked up. 
I think the guy that owned the World Trade Center, Silverstein, took advantage of the crisis to destroy his own building (Building 7) with a controlled demolition 2 hours after the attacks. I don't really doubt that at all. 
That was $250.00 for googling, $750.00 in video editing, and $249,000.00 to shut the fuck up about it!
Yeah it's pretty usual for live streams, after the live stream ends it'll be switched to a standard youtube video and listed normally. I think you can change the settings for it to be listed as it's live but this is the default(or vice versa I don't remember which).
This is designed to brainwash both sides.

I read an article last night laying out the ramifications and basically that it was a 4d chess move. \n\nThe XO could have been clearer and there wouldn't be a case against it...but it wasn't. \n\nNow the leftist 9th circuit blocks it. That still doesn't stop the administration on working on a better vetting process, but it means that if ANY attack happens for the next few months....President Trump or Sean Spicer get to stand up and say "You fucking retards, we tried to stop it and you communist POS said nooo bring them in"\n\nIf nothing happens then the administration can implement the new process and no one was hurt.\n\nAside from this whole court battle...which the rest of the 9th circuit is questioning....there is no downside from a political stand point for him(obviously a downside of possible casualties that the XO was trying to prevent). \n

Holy shit, feels badman, he's probably the best part of the show(aside from the talents). I respect him a lot for sticking to his principles, leaving a successful show like that take a lot of convictio\n\nHe's a black comedian not SJW and PC enough for NBC, despite holding pretty left view points....Times are a changing.
holy crap, I've never seen anything like that\n
(° ͜ʖ °)  indeed\n\n
I don't think the millions of Europeans who's savings and livelihoods are tied into the euro would agree. I think you are conflating EU with the Euro. \n\nThey EU must be demolished, but the euro is a much dicier prospect. I hope the people in the EU can see which way the wind is turning and start exchanging for more local currency where available.
No repeat offenders!\n\nTakes only a moment to administer!\n\nCosts less than $0.50 per treatment! Sometimes even cheaper!\n\n

He's going to look awfully silly with all those bricks and no coat to go with them, someone get this patriot a coat!
Government uses it as an excuse to expand the police state. You are wrong in your assumption government would profit from it because it already does but worse. \n\nRight now government agencies profit from the on going "war on drugs" while turning people who are not hurting anyone into criminals. I don't smoke pot and wouldn't even if it was legal, but I see the oppression and damage having this prohibition in place does.\n\nI want to see it legalized because I want to see the dumbass turf wars over pot distribution end. I want to see the end of people being arrested because they wanted to have fun with their friends, in their home, not bothering anyone. I wanted to see the further militarization of police tapered back. \n\nYour possible downside pales in comparison to the very real effects being felt right this second. 
If Le Pen gets elected and starts a successful referendum to leave the EU that's it...the EU is dead.
If it's a misdemeanor it won't pop up.
excellent photo pede
Why did they spell it marihuana?
I canceled because I can't support a company that would address white people directly like that. White people are literally Hitler.
WTF??? DO YOU SEE THAT HAND WAVE???\n\nNAZI SALUTE CONFIRMED
In a blurry world, Be like Trump.
I was told pizza was more popular in DC.
Bingo, that's why I respect him for sticking to his principles but not his principles. Same goes for Bernie, he's an idiot socialist but he goes full tilt socialist instead of trying to pretend he's not.
Haha His actual name is Felix.
hwell then
I thought something similar. I asked them why they hate women being able to defend themselves.
I think we should get this man two bricks, twice the escape speed
He's old school democrat....the kind that is not SJW enough or not PC enough now for the democrats. 
I live in GA and this all seems to be consistant with the media narrative to push GA as one of the swing states this past election. Outside of Atlanta/macon and Savannah, there was 0 democrat support out the norm. \n\nEven then Savannah is scewed by the Savannah College of Art and Design so you have a lot more "liberal" influence than you would normally. \n\nThe media was trying to push the swing state narrative so when these attacks caused a flip no one would question it. However "boots on the ground" the landscape was and still is littered with Trump signs.\n
Oh god that looks so awkward if you don't know Obama is introducing each person not trying to shake their hand.\n\n"This is so and so"\n"This is blahblah"\nEtc
I hope going forward they will remember that. Democrats can no longer take the high ground.\n
woh woh woh...slow down....that's a little harsh
I identify as a meat Popsicle and I find this offensive.
wtf did I just watch
Already on it ;)
Who knows. They're slowing screwing over their own logic and values anyways. 
Well that's probably better than the current number of liberals who think it's okay to use violence against opinions they don't like. 
2 months?!
This is what I don't get. I started lurking here for conspiracies about *anything*. All these political shills are kind of annoying. 
"Purge me of my intolerable crime of thought!"
Hi I voted for Hillary Clinton thank you. Thanks for generalizing an individual that looks into other opinions. Nice to see that the regressive liberals are still going further and further off the deep end and pushing me away from the Democrats. 
Wow California, collusion much?
And? Your point is?
Conservative SJWs? Does that mean that they're far left on the political compass yet economically more libertarian?
He ran to his safe space
Some think it was the Russians
They're authoritarians
I wonder how long it will take for that kind of argument to reach colleges. 50 years maybe?
How demented do you have to be to do something like this? I give Sweden 20 years. 
He should've said, "you'll see in three nights in Sweden."
All I see are unicorns
Coming from The Blaze too and I'm pissed about that. They're in bed with the establishment. Except for Tomi Lahren maybe, but fuck Glenn Beck. 
No because the regressive leftists have no standards while the right police their own. Milo took the heat for his comment and I hope he comes back around eventually, but the regressive left doesn't give a shit because they are disgusting idiots. As a former liberal (now classical liberal/conservative) I can see that's why the right is right. 
https://boards.4chan.org/pol/thread/113460155\n\nI saw it from another comment. If you're right about it coming from the right first then there's infighting in the GOP. Milo being at CPAC was already controversial to many conservatives. 
Can someone source evidence for this stuff that's been happening recently?
I don't know about that. Rape snd sexual assault is still extremely serious in colleges. At least when I left last year it was. 
No thanks to pez for making r/redacted the echo chamber that it is now
Malik's brother?
"Making 'Anti-Semitic' jokes normalizes 'it'". I guess playing and reviewing games like shit normalizes shitty players and shit games as well. 
I couldn't even watch 30 seconds. More of the moral high ground and lies that the VFN MSM feeds people like they did to me. 
Instead of the rape bracelets they should just hand out hijabs or burkas instead so the men won't be forced to rape them after being seduced by their sexy bodies. 
There's no context from the Swedish government because the police, government, and media are covering up crimes committed by migrants. If you actually watched the "documentary" or looked into it then you might learn about something that you say the President "has no idea what he's talking about". \n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqalgeQXQgl\n\nhttp://www.dn.se/nyheter/sverige/assaults-at-the-stockholm-festival-have-never-been-fully-investigated/\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOF89felo0E\n\nhttps://www.gatestoneinstitute.org/5195/sweden-rape\n\nhttps://www.gatestoneinstitute.org/9901/sweden-migrants-costs
So how do you explain Jamaican Americans? Do you call them African Americans as well? Jamaican African American?
I wonder if the CIA killed off that ambassador. 
I have a feeling that Alex Jones may be targeted next by the media.
This is why I love watching Tucker. He'll let them run their mouths off for a bit even if it's ridiculous then he steps in so that he can counter. 
So I was just reminded by Trump's tweet about the media. This is all too convenient since they just announced Milo for CPAC. They tried to slander Pewdiepie and Tomi Lahren (a little bit regarding her 'scandalous' tweets). I think they're starting to coordinate hit pieces against certain individuals as much as they can. Trump saying that the media is the enemy of the people was right. 
Look up the CIA's heart attack gun. It's the most sinister way of assassinating someone. Apparently they somehow give you drugs or something that give you minor heart problems and they give it gradually. Eventually the target may go to the doctor to get checked out and they get heart meds. Finally they use that gun to induce a heart attack and viola. Death due to heart disease/attack. It's fucked up. 
The MSM is trying to dig back into people's videos to write hit pieces against them in coordinated slander attempts. It's quite obvious now. Trump was right again. The media is the enemy of the people. 
I hope we see more of Don Lemon's alcohol problems
I should probably visit Europe for the first time this summer before shit goes down. 
It wasn't the best 4D chess move by Trump. He should've said "look at what's happening with the rapes in Germany and the rape last night in Sweden." A lot of news outlets are falsely claiming that he's referring to a terror attack. 
Just inadvertently admitted that MSNBC is committing media manipulation. Woops. 
The Dream Team
If you actually learned about the topic then you might learn that the Gatestone Institute was the first to call Sweden the "Rape Capital of the West". It's also not entirely true that it's because of the sex crime reform in 2005. The amount of sex crimes has been rising since *1975*. \n\nhttps://www.gatestoneinstitute.org/5195/sweden-rape
Not sure what you mean. 
The Revelations EE was uniquely difficult. It took about 10 days to get through the first few steps. It was also the first time I took part in trying to find the EE on a Zombies map. It wasn't fun haha. 
I forgot about the Horseshoe theory. So they're more authoritarian like SJWs then, probably like Christian conservatives. \n\nNote: I'm an ex-Christian
Many liberals are that naive though. 
Good, they need to realize how bigoted they're making the left cesspool that left me. 
If they do that over the "Russian" hacking without any evidence, there will be a lot of civil unrest. 
This would make everyone's lives better
Except there's precedent for calling CNN "Clinton News Network" since she colluded with about 9 journalists from CNN. 
*Dar as-Salam!* \n\nSeriously though that's hilarious 
Wtf I hate trying to copy other countries' systems now
What I don't get is that I thought Bannon resigned from Breitbart. 
Honestly disappointed with what he said. After the UC Berkeley riots I saw that "White Nationalism is NOT the answer" video and it made me realize that many liberals betrayed and strayed away from MLK Jr.'s dream of judging people by their character. Hopefully he comes back around.
"gatestoneinstitute is zoinist website. look at your sources. its all just anti islam propaganda." \n\nI was talking about that claim of yours in the quote. What do swedish sexual assault laws have to do with the reputation of the Gatestone Institute? Sounds like your point is not clear.
I got banned from there today as well. I was trying to discuss the Swedish government covering up migrant crimes with cited sources. The irony is amazing. I blame pez or fez or whatever his fucking name is. 
Ehhh I don't agree with avoiding them entirely. I will recommend that one should never even try to date them and especially don't dance with girls at a party. It's too risky today. However, definitely stay away from women that look and act unhinged. 
Weren't there marches against people that were trying to show support for the victim?
Just keep reminding them of it.
K College is doing a similar thing. They had an email that was sent out that said they would not release immigration status unless required to do so by law (weird). It makes me wonder if they are housing illegals, which would piss off any reasonable individual given the very small class sizes. I heard that the city of Kalamazoo said that they would be a sanctuary city as well. Nice to see Kzoo friends on The_Donald. 
Not sure how I feel about the study if it only has 800 samples
Well for one he was pissing off SJWs to show how ridiculous their way of thinking is, which I appreciate. He took it too far with that comment though. Makes me think his whole "schtick" is just who he is. 
Even from a business perspective, they're also probably debating on whether or not to let him go because of Steve Bannon despite him resigning. 
Unfortunately I don't have access to my email anymore so I can't get the text, but I don't recall them citing FERPA in the email and I never heard of it until you mentioned it. There was a petition that went around that asked the trustees to affirm that the school "will welcome students regardless of immigration status, and refuse to partner with ICE unless required to do so by law."
Don't date women in college and never stick your dick in crazy. \n\nSource: I had an informal false accusation of sexual assault 1 & 1/2 years after the fact. It was terrifying. 
Wtf I love massive wealth inequality now
\\#notMYbathroom
Trump may have just forgotten what he was thinking about regarding the Tucker Carlson Tonight segment on Fox News. \n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OSzjfAMk-RI\n\nIf you're new here I'll tell you to look up 4D chess. It's possible he could've just lied about "last night in Sweden" to get the media to report on the troubled immigration policy of Sweden since the media lies, a lot. \n\nIn Sweden, the definition of rape is broadly defined and that was done before the migrant crisis. I believe there was a reform in 2005 regarding sex crime legislation. However, taking that into account, there is still a problem with rape in Sweden. In 2015 the Gatestone Institute (a conservative think tank) named Sweden "The Rape Capital of the West". Note that I'm not sure how much of an effect that the migrant crisis has now on the  number of rapes in Sweden, but it's worth considering even if the truth hurts. \n\nhttps://www.gatestoneinstitute.org/5195/sweden-rape\n\nTo counter your statement that Sweden is more rape conscious I'll state that the media, government, and police are reported to have covered up rapes committed by immigrants, which many think is because of political correctness/fear of offending. Personally, I'm welcoming to immigrants if they mostly assimilate. However, I don't agree with a highly irresponsible immigration policy like the one in Sweden and the cover ups. Germany has similar problems as well. There's many other reports from the Gatestone Institute regarding the large number of problems in Sweden and I'd highly recommend looking into it more rather than reading the majority of mainstream media sources. \n\nhttps://www.gatestoneinstitute.org/9901/sweden-migrants-costs
Yeah I was like wtf? I heard that over half of the police support her. 
Lol fucking conspiracy MSM. Not surprised. 
"People did but one person found something then a million other people replicated it and looked for the next step"\n\nThis is exactly how the Revelations EE went. Ughh...
Bat child was classic
The fuck? Is this like feminist Abstract Algebra? If this shit is starting to creep into the sciences, we're going to have problems. 
The media trying to brush this shit aside is exactly why no one trusts them. 
#Very Fake News
Well liar if you looked through my extensive comment history you would see posts of me saying in The_Donald that I actually supported Hillary. Want an example? Here's some gems: "Former Democrat voter here. I can speak for at least 1 vote haha", "I call myself a center leftist now (don't hate me) after getting red pilled and repelled from all their bullshit. A lot of the left and liberals need to reflect on why they lost and look up the definition of insanity.", or this goodie "And yet many leftists are trying to pass it off as "oh it's just Antifa/black bloc". Give us a break with your lies! This former Democrat voter is not voting Democrat in 2018 or 2020. MAGA." You are a traitor to the ideals of real liberalism with your sickening comment and it's not going to help the country.
Got any proof for those claims?
They might be able to, but they'd have to edit out the ambassador's transcript. Possibly parts of Flynn's. I think they don't want to release it because foreign leaders don't want their phone conversations to be public. That's why the leaks were controversial. 
I lived in Perth for 5 months so I can kind of see why he said that. I saw 2 racial incidents when I was there, but it didn't seem bad overall. You lived there more than I did though. 
All the fake hate crimes? Who knows. Many on the left normalized it now. 
Lol if Trump was even resembling Big Brother could you imagine Hillary Clinton being in office? She'd be Big Sister with her media coalition. 
Hey yall. I keep seeing this post and I wanted to let you know to take it with a large grain of salt. For a study with only 800 samples that says "up to 2 million may have registered" I think that a study like this should be met with high skepticism. 800 is far too low for a sample size in nationwide polling. 
Omg we need more of these
Well as I understand it, the alt-right hate Milo since he's a gay Jewish man. Look up the Daily Stormer. They said that they would never read Breitbart again unless they fired him. It looks like Breitbart may now be the locale for the alt-right if they fire him. A lot of establishment conservatives hate him as well. Not sure where that leaves him and many other Trump supporters on the political compass. 
As I understand the situation with Milo it was a hit job that came from the establishment GOP. Never vote for establishment candidates. 
This is what I don't get. For me I picked based on who I thought was worse as did many others, especially the Bernie Bros. Then the left turns around and blames the Russians or racism without realizing that they had a shit candidate. 
Tbh with how far left those folks have gone, being politically center or even moderately liberal is now a conservative position haha. 
The fuck? I don't see any sources for this story and from looking around online a bit this sounds like fake news. 
What is MSNBC?
How would Trump be responsible for the Clintons attacking journalists?
If you were to tell me that I can no longer walk around my once very safe neighborhood during the night, there's a problem. Especially during the daytime in a "no go zone", there'd be a problem. 
Coming from The_Donald I personally disagree with what many of them are saying over there. Milo's comment was too far. Now I hope many of you will hold leftists to the same standard unlike that garbage site Salon. 
These incidents are also being covered up by the media in Sweden and now here. 
I bet you that the majority of Bernie bros are now aghast at Trump attacking the media. Man the times quickly change. 
I wonder if the Blaze torched (no pun intended) Milo in order to attack the regressive leftists that defend pedos. 
The regressive left will be shitting their pants!!!
Honestly the CIA needs to be gutted. They're too powerful and according to Julian Assange they have a $600 million contract with WaPo as well.
Who? /s
He'd certainly have an awesome chance at reelection if that happened. 
And Vox is trying to sweep it under the rug. That's a real rape culture right there. 
Based on yours, I switch 1 and 2 
Yeah it's literally diversity for the sake of diversity. It adds nothing. Absolutely nothing. 
Yeah I'm not going to defend that by playing mental gymnastics. It's just wrong to say something like that even if you are a provocateur. \n\nEdit: Personally I don't think his book deal should've been cancelled since I do know that he has called out weird transgender people for using girl's restrooms. What he said is still weird as fuck though.

The press secretary interacts with the media, and deals with the White House press corps on a daily basis, generally in a daily press briefing.\nThe press secretary serves by the appointment of and at the pleasure of the president; the office does not require the advice and consent of the U.S. Senate, though because of the frequent briefings given to the media, who in turn inform the public, the position is still a very prominent non-Cabinet post.]

It's kinda like not knowing who Leo Messi is. You don't have to like football to know who he is. Idk, I guess it's possible but shumi is a living legend like Messi. I have friends that watch literally zero sports and know who they both are, idk anecdotal.
Exactly. He is being very, very clever. My mother, who could care less for this stuff and had never heard of him, ordered his book after the Berkeley protests to see what the fuss was all about. His detractors are playing directly into his hands. 
Pretty sure you can swap it out with the railgun.

Last midseason patch I think?
I just tried to explain how the duties of the presidency are similar to a CEOs. I think I did a decent job at explaining it, and I am not going to source "how things are". There are plenty of sources on the duties of each office, but in reality it boils down to the most important thing, my lovely analogy of steering the ship.\n\nDid I not say that in the end it is about "steering the ship" directing the people under you to achieve your goals and keeping them on track. CEOs are the best in the world at that, and is why they are paid so much. I do not see the flawed logic in viewing the presidency as a job where you direct the people below you to achieve your goals. I am pretty sure the president isn't writing his own bills. Especially with his English. And I am pretty sure his cabinet is there for a reason. \n\nI did not mean to claim that politicians are worse, I was trying to disagree with the idea that business people cannot be just as good, if not better. I am sure plenty of CEOs would be crap at it. It would be stupid to claim otherwise.\n\nI think we know politicians can do the job well, my point is that CEOs can too. People immediately dismiss the idea that a business person can be a good president, due to conflicted interests etc. \n\nAs for the anecdotal stuff. You asked me for my knowledge on the matter and I gave it. You asked for credibility, and I gave what I could. I never intended to state my opinions as fact, or humblebrag. I tried to explain why people see CEOs as unfit for the presidency, and why these assumptions are inaccurate.\n\nOh and the duties of a CEO are usually in PDF for some reason and I didn't want to link a download because stranger danger :/ They are pretty easy to find and pretty ubiquitous.\n\nIf you want more clarification on the VW guy. My point was he took the fall for a decision that he did not have the power to make. Therefore he has to be the scape goat. It doesn't get more simple than that.

Because money isn't always the most important thing to engineers. The success of the company is much more important to some, as well as just working there. That's how startups work. Sometimes it's just not financially viable to pay all your workers what they deserve. Also it sometimes acts as a filter. If you feel that the pay isn't enough, and you don't view working at the company itself as compensation, then you shouldn't be working there.  \n\nI personally would work at spacex for the minimum I needed to survive. Rent, food, gas, etc. Anything else I would view as a bonus. Can you put a price on the experience of working there? To me it's invaluable.

Yea, he's steamrolling his agenda while everyone is distracted by this immigration ban left intentionally vauge. He could have avoided all of this by adding that current green card holders/citizens exempt. He did not, and there is no way his lawyers missed it. He is just distracting everyone while he does everything else. That's my conspiracy theory lol. I'm not too worried about any permanent damage, because the opposing party always says this, and it always ends up OK. Yes this is a little more severe, but I am going to choose to lower my cortisol levels for a few years.

I'm surprised they lasted this long. \n\nIt's nearest to a town of like 15k people, where the biggest event in it's history is the in-n-out moving in. Next biggest; Chipotle moving in, although it's close with the truck pulls. That's pretty big. We are also close to the pot capital of the world! \n\n
Lol. Yet another example. I was just browsing r/all the other day and they were saying how t_D is a circle jerk that bans dissenting views (we just ban liars and trolls, and circle jerking is fun btw) and how they r/news and r/worldnews allow all views. I didn't reply. \n\nWe need to make a compilation of all of this and post it (on their subs) Maybe red pill a few and get them to understand where they are getting their news sources.

There is just as much a reason to complain. Hillary is terrible too. She is actually corrupt. Trump is actually an orangutan. It was lesser of two evils, and how do you compare evil. We however would not hear it as much. The media is predominantly left leaning. There is no arguing that, same with large population centers. Thus protesting would be harder and less prominent in the news. That doesn't mean that people are not equally resentful, because they absolutely are, just not as loud.
I would watch. Structuring it like the bachelor would be great too. Just no homo.
Makes since... Only pussies crash.
To me that is no different. Grouping half of the supporters of her political opponent, and calling them deplorable is just as bad if not worse. I also truly believe that if Clinton was elected we would, at least, have another minor war in the ME. She seemed dead set on starting a few as SoS. Trump we will have to see, but if he does it prbly will be big. Everything he does is big. 
Hey! You still alive m8? It's dangerous to leave this sub for rational people.

As someone who's generally libertarian, I have to say, even though he's not a perfect match for my views,  he is _definitely_ the president America needs  right now.

Helpful chart: http://wmbriggs.com/pics/nolan_chart.png\n\nThis is called a "Nolan Chart". It basically expresses how much permissiveness there is in government.\n\nLibertarianism (small _l_ ) inhabits the top corner. It means the government stays out of your wallet, bedroom, and phone records. A strong libertarian would be okay with you having guns and drugs.\n\nConservatism inhabits the right corner. It stands for traditional values. A strong conservative would frown on gay marriage and drug use, but would be pro-gun and pro-life.\n\nIn the post-Reagan world, Republicans would be in the Conservative block, with the establishment (McCain, GW Bush, and Jeb!) leaning Statist. The Libertarian Party would be in the Libertarian block, but farther to the left.\n\n(Opinion: It's hard to place Donald Trump on the chart ([1](https://espnfivethirtyeight.files.wordpress.com/2016/01/silver-bloomberg-11.png), [2](https://i.redd.it/65jlyb1b0tjx.png)), because he's economically quite libertarian, but also has some statist/authoritarian policies. He's conservative, but for gay rights. He supports concealed carry, but also stronger police.)

He's a capital-L "Libertarian", but a poor little-l libertarian. Basically he mixes and matches Republican and Democrat stances, rather than truly standing up for liberty.\n\nRon Paul is a real libertarian, and Rand is pretty good too. Outside the GOP, the Constitution Party is good at holding to libertarian principles as well. The modern Libertarian party, with Johnson and Weld, is "moderate" if they are anything.

It is an incredibly selfish perspective for a person to be pro-choice because he or she cannot be aborted himself. All lives do matter, and life starts at conception, not birth.

> I think very few people want to get an abortion. \n\nHere's where you are wrong: http://www.nrlc.org/uploads/factsheets/FS01AbortionintheUS.pdf\n\nThe abortion ratio is around 20%--that is, one abortion for every 5 pregnancies in the United States. This is very common and disturbing. Quite simply, a lot of women or their husbands/boyfriends would rather get an abortion than be sexually responsible.\n\nPP is responsible for a huge number of abortions each year. If any other publicly funded organization caused as many deaths, you can be sure that there would be enormous outcry, no matter how many condoms and pills they pass out. Their educational and STD testing functions could be performed by literally any organization that doesn't abort babies, and we would be fine with that. \n\nFurthermore, PP is an inherently racist organization. Do some reading about [Margaret](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margaret_Sanger) [Sanger](https://answersingenesis.org/sanctity-of-life/abortion/planned-parenthood/), the founder. Its primary purpose is eugenics. Sanger wanted to keep black people and some other groups from reproducing. It's sickening.\n\nYou said you would like to hear an argument explaining the opposition to Planned Parenthood. I've said why I am opposed to PP. I'd like to turn the tables and ask why you are defending this particular organization.

DeVos will probably not do much.  The American education system is a giant piece of shit.\n\nPlenty of good articles at American Thinker on the subject.\n\nBasically the Teacher's Unions and government contractors for books and construction take all the money.  Public school systems are an overcrowded, glorified, liberal dogma pushing daycare.\n\nDeVos will only achieve something if she burns the Dept. of Education to the ground.  And even then, it's still 50/50, as the teacher's union needs to be broken, and control needs to go back to the local communities.\n\nThat's easily a 5-10 year long struggle, minimum
You know these Sacramento fucks are holding back the $7 BILLION earmarked for water just so they can later "borrow" the money towards either pension payouts, or payouts for Feinstein and the insane high speed railway that no one wants.\n\nThey were probably never going to use it for water projects.  Just needed a way to get more taxpayer money in the coffers that they can then divert to other programs.\n\nThey are fucking MASTERS of sourcing and diverting MONEY where they need it.

And he will only become more popular now.
National Voter ID would not affect local elections I would imagine.\n\nThe only thing that could even potentially turn CA red would be MASS deportations.  And even then the dynamics are so cucked it may not make a difference.
yeah, honestly this shit scares me.  Because next some degenerate fuck is going to just outright punch someone's baby in front of them.  And the poor cuck white fucker won't do a damn thing about it out of fear.  And then it will become a whole thing.  Like the knockout game in the USA, except by these sick fuck subhuman animals on babies.
Maybe Sandy Berger?
he said "I’ll give you an example of what such a plan might look like, just for discussion purposes. This is only an example so you can see what sort of scope I’m talking about."
double points for proper use of both "your" and "you're" in one post.
I don't know if McCain is a leak or not.  One thing for sure, McCain is the poster child for term limits.  Senators like him have a stranglehold lock on the statewide vote.  It's too easily defrauded.  The only way they got rid of Harry Reid was to have someone literally beat his ass.\n\nWhen was the last time a prominent embedded Senator lost an election?
Gee, I don't know, if a refugee ~~rapes~~ assaults you should we report it, for fear of unfairly focusing negative connotation towards refugees?\n\n*edit: it's never a good idea to use rape as an example.  Apologies to society...*\n\nI get a traffic ticket should I be forced to pay it?\n\nGo fuck yourself.  As an American citizen I face the prospect of the full fucking brunt of the law being brought down on me for the smallest violation... at minimum thousands of fucking dollars in court and attorney fees.\n\nHow about we sent old Liz there down to Mexico to go commit some non-violent crimes and go waving an American flag around and see how that goes for her?
Jerry Brown hasn't found a project that his father former Gov. Pat Brown built that he doesn't want to tear the fuck down to spite his daddy.
Well if water isn't bursting through old decrepit damns, it's busting through centuries old underground water pipes that ALSO haven't been maintained in the last 100 years.\n\nSeems they love wasting their water here in the desert state.  I bet old Moonbean Fuckwad Brown hates infrastructure and damns because his daddy Pat Brown actually fucking did something and built them all.\n\nOld Pat Brown probably knew his son Jerry was a fucking worthless pile of dried up old cunt, and now the little fuckface is sticking it to daddy by letting all his formerly magnificent projects erode into shit.\n\nMark my words, this is more likely true than not.
THIS.  I live in a big city.  I can do with 50% less shitty restaurants and Golf Lands.
CNN: Flynn resigns because NSA recorded discussions with space aliens.\n\nBullshit Media:  NSA proves Flynn is a criminal with ties to space aliens!!  Trump must resign.\n\nBlogger Elite:  Impeach Trump.  Protect space alien rights.\n\n9th Circus Court:  Space Aliens can sue Trump.

CNN: Trump replaces airline pilot.  Administration in turmoil.
That's rough.  I was raised on the east coast.  I guess that shit is instinct.  "No good deed goes unpunished"... I heard that since I was born.\n\nSo you need to really consider who you are willing to take it up the ass for when you choose to do nice things.  Some dickwad neighbor does not even make the list for consideration.
hot white girl privilege
Persians, yes, for the most part from the 70's.  The ones from today, not so much.
this dude is the real deal.  Much appreciated.
Sacramento is a shit hole.  The small towns further north, yes, that sucks.\n\nBut Sacramento is the state capital, and the gov cucks roam there.  "Excremento", we like to call it.
yes, this.  I should have thought of that.
same here
Here's the funny thing.  Clearly you are referring to extremist liberals.\n\nNow, let's say, just for shit's and giggles, that we just bend over and give them everything they want.  All of it.  Every stupid bathroom right, every immigration door open, every abortion and free this and free that and complete bend over ankle grab and have white people open bank accounts to be given away for reparations... fucking all of it.\n\nAnd then what?\n\nAre all these crazy angry militant liberals going to take that deep breath, and be like "oh, okay, WOW!  Thank you!  Everyone this is great!!"  And then, like, just be happy and live peaceful lives and work and raise families and be in harmony??\n\nThe answer to that is a resounding NO.  They are lunatics.  Poorly educated, often mentally disturbed, often drug or alcohol addicted, abused, angry, aggressive, regressive, militant pack animals.  That's how they behave, and that's how it will continue.  It will never stop.\n\nOur general culture needs a crash reboot.  Is it worth doing what needs to be done?  That's not an easy question to answer.  But when the "other side" won't let you have ANY fucking peace, even in a small town in middle America... then they leave you no real choice, do they?\n\nThat wasn't much of a pep talk.  But it is what it is.
Jesus dude you should open a fucking casino.
you're right I messed that up totally.  Mixed up my fake news lines.\n
I don't suppose there will be any street camera footage from East 67th Street right around 9:15am EST, of this unfortunate diplomat before he dropped?\n\nAny, you know, odd pat on the back from a stranger, or reach up to a sudden neck pain?\n\nOf course not.
easily minimum 30 million.
based AF, having growing up in the warzone that is The People's Republic of Santa Monica.
um... that's a % of GDP, not dollars to dollars.  Plus WWII.\n\nCompare Obama to Bush, that is more apples to apples.  And Bush was not our best.
Holy crap.  I had no idea illegals were used to tally House reps.  That's fucking insane.\n\nThis would also directly affect the Electoral College votes of CA as well.\n\nI had no fucking idea, and this should be TOP STORY.  Shit just got even more real on immigration.\n\nIf this is true... holy shit what a scam!!  Not just illegals but all the visa overstays and anchor babies and everything.\n\nNow this whole things makes even MORE sense.
How about when they take the fucking welfare money and then go BACK to the countries they escaped those horrors from for thier fucking vacation?!??
halfway through your story I wanted to nut punch you for grabbing so much ankle.
what?  don't you know the difference between sex, gender, sexual gender, gender identity, sexual identity, intended gender sexual gender identity, and gender identisexity?\n\nFascist.
haha... there might be something to that.\n\nOr maybe there are 65 million brains all just pre-wired to jump at the things he triggers because we've all been thinking it for the past 25 years.  So it's all happening at faster than human normal speed, because we've all been chomping at the damn bit bitching and moaning about it for so long.  And now he's just like, fuck it, let's go for it all at once - build a wall, release the Tesla papers (not Musk BS), solve JFK murder... and we're all just fucking eating it up like hungry wolves.\n\nI know I eat a lot faster when I'm hungry.\n\nWe can only hope that Trump starts handing out black Ray bans and telling everyone to put the damn glasses on...
Thomas Massie is the best Rep we got.  I'll second Rand on the Senate side.  Rep Steve King is good too.
jesus... go Black-to-White on this quote and change all the He's and his to she's and hers.\n\nFeels bad, man.
fake or not, in the end this only helps Milo.\n\nIt shows the completely lies and fuckery the left is capable of, in broad daylight... and they are stupidly now taking on people with millions of college age followers, thereby counteracting the last decade of indoctrination they worked so hard to build in the failing US education system.\n\nMilo will wear this with a badge of honor and use it to further red pill college kids across the US.  Universities of course will no longer allow him to come and speak - which was hardly any different than before - but it will only increase his popularity.\n\nHell he can probably self-publish now and make even more money, seeing as how his book pre-sold so well on Amazon.
Stand down, homie.  If YOU noticed it, so did a thousand other people actually there that day.
No doubt.\n\nI've spent lots of time in Persian neighborhoods in CA, lion and sun flying proudly.  I did see a lot of pro-Hillary stuff.  I suppose that was just smart business at the time.\n\nMy generation of Persians though -- the kids of the '70's exiles -- mostly got pretty soft and liberal in their comfy lives in sunny CA.  That's just a generalization of course, but one based on my experience.\n\nedit: poor writing
Where did I say "armed children"? 
Think of it this way -- "our own intelligence agency people" are CAREER spooks who have been in the FBI and CIA and NSA, some for 30+ years.  Can you imagine what it would be like to be a the tip of that spear for THAT long?  Your entire perspective on reality is completely separated from yours or mine.\n\nThese people, these career intelligence operatives, essentially believe they rule the world.  Presidents come and go.  Attorney Generals come and go.  Supreme Court judges come and get murdered.  Yet they remain.  Nameless.  Subject to bribery by... oh, say, the Muslim Brotherhood.\n\nAnd the people that work below them are 99% just trying to keep their asses safe and their pensions in tact.  You try and be a patriotic hero when you boss has been sitting at the top of the CIA for the last 15 years and has forgotten more state secrets than most of us will ever even learn about.  Ask Seth Rich how that worked out.\n\nIs is worth is to do what needs to be done to clean THAT shitstorm up?  Hell yes it is.  This is the evil leprosy riddled monster in the tower.  This is William Wallace prima notte type shit.  If we don't fix it now, we're not going to get another chance.  It's been 30 years since we last had a chance.  20 years before that.  The country can't last another 30 years if we don't clean house now.
Wow.  This trash political prostitute is basically saying that the US will "be fine" with the same "amount of rapes" that Sweden has... because, you know, we have more fucking people in the US, so it won't affect crime stats that much.\n\nFUCK YOU, YOU EVIL POLITISKANK!!!!\n\nI bet her neighborhood is 98% white too and will take in zero unvetted refugees.
Ryan is a Rep, and more vulnerable to getting primaried and booted out.\n\nSenators like McCuck and Graham have more of a stranglehold on their voting blocks.  The more "statewide" the vote the most susceptible to fraud it is.  That's why Senators last as long as they do.
well... they don't have insurance and they don't have money to pay you.  So of course they are going to hit and run.  Even if you called the cops, they won't show up.  Even if they did, and arrested them, they would be released.\n\nSo yeah... that.  Be fucking careful.\n\nYOU, on the other hand, would be fucked, caught on camera, chased down by the cops, and nailed with $15K plus worth of legal fees, who knows what in insurance payouts, and years of headaches, and probably lose your driver's license.
confirmed.  wow that's fucking brutal.  I approve.
I'm getting old.  Please pop out a few more for me, brother.
you could do it yourself with screencaps and photoshop.  Same difference really.
Who are the sick fucks who work at Pizza Hut that made a pizzagate pedo participant (speculative) their spokesperson?\n\nSay that 10 times fast.  Pizzagate pedo participant spokesperson.
That article has WAY too many words for news media or liberals to follow.  They need to get right to the smears and name calling right up front.\n\nForget all this background and details and legitimate story shit.\n\nNot unnoticed though... Jerome Corsi... who none other than FBIAnon said was close to chasing down the Clinton trail...
I'm taking that to mean "we don't have time to edit this shit so please pedes and autists do the digging for us"
So who died about a year ago that might be one of these "7 persons"???
You'd think he said something about women letting him grab them by the pussy hats.\n\nTaken out by the GayKK.  Crazy times.
this is a great fucking point.\n\nLizard people may be next.
Um... liberal hypocrisy?
Agreed.  Asset forfeiture and militarized police units need to be done away with.  That shit is all crazy.\n\nAlso the dog shooting has got to fucking stop.\n\nAnd bashing someone's head against the back of the police cruiser because they made a faint leg movement that you saw as a threatening gesture and the police union watches the video and says "cool, internal investigation ruled that the suspect's half-inch leg motion was threatening, officer acted in compliance".\n\nThere is a lot of major fuckery going on with police.  But yeah, dealing with that stuff can wait, because generally you can avoid that by not getting your ass into trouble in the first place.
There has to be more to it than just that.  Because there have been plenty of accusations against EVERYONE in the Trump admin, top to bottom, and this is the first person to be removed.\n\nRemember how much it took for Trump to drop Lewandoski.  And then they planted him on media to be a surrogate.\n\nI don't know what Trump's plan is, but I have to think there is more to it than him just giving in to "media pressure".\n\nHonesty, I didn't even hear anything about it from the media (not that I pay attention to them) until he actually resigned.\n\nJust my two cents.
oreo - black on outside, white on inside
Seriously, all these boycotting pede chess player women are catching me by surprise... these are some beautiful chess champions!!!
This.  It would be kind of funny to see some little illegal girl trying to switch to her black ninja mask right before she gets wailed in the head with a flagpole.\n\nI mean, she would heal OK and everything.  It just might take a while.  After she gets deported.
I'm not shitting you I think Chuck Woolery could take over after 8.  Let's keep with the based TV celebrities.
The original God Emperor.\n\nLook into the great indian Chief's battle stories about Washington.  He rode on a horse across the battlefield like a spirit god, being shot multiple times but never going down.  A medal with his name on it was found on the battlefield with a bullet hole in it.  The man was truly protected, a god among men.
and not very deep.  Dense.  But not deep.
this is fucking genius
And no one outside their echo chamber gives a fuck still.\n\nI think it's just time to eliminate PACs entirely.  They do more harm than good.
Unless you try to resell it.  Good luck getting half back!
I isn't just formerly black neighborhoods -- section 8 government housing has turned nearly ALL of LA into a mess, from the beach all the way to the state line.
a real shame about that crushed larynx he gave himself next week.
To add salt to the wound, if YOU rear ended someone, hell even those same illegal drivers, you would get bent over and gang banged.  Financially, of course.
Too easy.
holy crap.  what if this got magically installed in libshit media user's browsers...
Someone should do like a medialiesagain.com that auto crawls and displays the other websites and just switches the words...
um... gold does not have limited uses.  Everything electronic uses gold.\n\nIncluding alien ship outer hulls.  That's why they all came here to steal our gold!!!
Scott did say... right there in the article... "This is only an example so you can see what sort of scope I’m talking about."\n\nSo, there's that.\n\nBut also, I can still be convinced of the whole reparations thing even though it's 20-fucking-17 already.  But let's be clear... it is more than just about "slavery".  Remember black people were also pretty much treated as second class until the '60's.  That's only 50 years ago.  Barely two generations.\n\n50 years ago, people were still like "ew, don't touch that a colored person used it".\n\nIf you want to make an argument that the US should offer some kind of a reparation other than a lifetime in welfare and free cell phones, then I'm game to listen to it.  If anyone has any good ideas.
Funny, they also say women need to cover up or else they will get too turned on and have to rape them.  I notice a pattern.\n\nInteresing that a key belief of many great Western philosophers was the concept of modesty and moderation.  Resisting urges and focusing energy on the arts and sciences.  I believe history shows which cultures had more achievements.
this is a joke now because we can laugh a bit.  But wait until someone's baby gets punched in their fucking crib.  
Why would you do that to Wyoming?!?  That's pretty fucked up.\n\nMaybe Puerto Rico.  But that's the best I can do.  Or Ceti Alpha V.
Of course not.  Also, your white privilege also ends at the border.  Just sayin'.
I love how the fucking cuck police all say "we are sworn to protect these communities".\n\nParticularly in light of the dick smoker from Denver who, while protecting one of his precious illegal mexican community gang members, allowed him to be released and kill another fucking mexican community college graduate member.\n\nAll in the name of protecting the community.\n\nSo what is the point of protection when you are protecting the criminals from punishment?  Why not just disband the fucking police entirely?\n\nExplain the logic.
Napaleon... the brother from wine country...\n\nThat's just too good.
Let me guess, Prince Aladweeb owns majority shares in Meetup.com too?
mmm desert shellfish.  My favorite.\n\nI'm thinking more it's because both bacon and clams might look like desert vajay-jays.\n\nI'm just surprised they haven't banned yams and figs, too.
Best fight scene ever.  The movie is also totally relevant and poignant to today's happenings.\n\nToo bad about the ending though.
Human history is far from simple.
has there been a Day 2 post yet?
Just think about that.  They are INTENTIONALLY making their own people sex crazed repressed lunatics.  Talk about ultimate control.  Give them drugs and shame them away from their biological drives.\n\nHere in the US the liberals use race and gender to control.  The Muslims just go right for the genetic balls.
well fuck, if I had paid operatives running half the government and "news" organizations and was invested in every social media company then my fucking pet cat could effectively use the media to spread his jihad against silverfish too.
Surely there is an actress of another eh.... "genre" that has or will take advantage of this.
As they should. What are you children doing throwing items at a presidential motorcade? That is an incredible failure as a parent,\nregardless of political views. \n
OK son. I believe you. 
We drool at the chance to go to war against the ATF. 
Call me a madman, but something inside of me wants to read a headline about a big throw down of rival 1% clubs at the Skate-o-Rama. 
I agree with all that you said. 
I bet you think Bill Nye is an actual scientist too, huh? 
I simply think that anyone who publicly berates the people who swear their lives to protect them is probably a terrible person inside and out. 
They are sending children strapped with explosives into marketplaces and beheading those who don't agree with them? Why is Wold Blitzer suppressing this crucial info?!?!? 
Do you have a source proving they hacked the RNC emails, or that there was anything of value if they did? By all accounts I have seen, it would appear the RNC was a lot less 'sloppy" with infosec, so it stands to reason that there was nothing so juicy. I am all ears though if you have a source I haven't seen...

His job is to uphold the Constitution. He becomes my enemy when he breaks that promise. I would absolutely shoot anyone trying to confiscate my guns. Tens of millions would do the same. If you do t recognize that, you live in a bubble. 
We moved away from California because we don't like Californians. We found that there is a whole nation of hundreds of millions of people on the "other side" that despise California just as much as we did. We are now home. 
Unless her biological dad is in fact a part of her life. Then it is the most disgusting thing I have witnessed...
I agree as well. It was the same scene of her whimpering through entire season. I didn't see what I would call "depth" there, almost to the point of being annoying, or at least distracting. It wasn't that big of a deal in a sea of greatness, but to me it was a a quirk that bothered me.  
As far as I am concerned, the democrats dig their own grave with their appalling emails. I don't know if the GOP has equally appealing emails, but you have to remember that Trump was hated by the GOP as well. You can't really count him as being "In their court".  Ether way, I am glad the emails came to light. I don't care who leaked them. I would love to see GOP emails as well, but what we have, we have because John Podesta is a complete idiot with an idiots password who fell for a simple phishing scam. 
I look at it as arguing about the temperature of dinosaur farts because we found methane in some rock. 
She was half way in the upside down. 
For a date though? Indoors? 
It's like watching video from a different world. This doesn't happen in Western Arkansas. We will kill these sorts and the police will look the other way. I like it that way. 
Dude loves him some gray clothes. 
A guy I know is a demolitions expert. Works in mining and similar, blowing things up all day. Cool right? It's just another monotonous job after the first couple of weeks. 
Sort of an old school version of Yelp. 
You and I are as qualified to speak on the matter as each other. 
Oh get out of here with that. Where I live I see as many black folks open carrying as white folks. No one pays any attention to any of it because they are all just folks. We also have no crime, which s a direct correlation to the armed citizens, not the color of their skin. 
Not at all OK. Not even if I know about it. 
Anne Hathaway would have been a good choice. This casting was so off it hurts. 
about 90% of this sub is immature young people spouting heretical nonsense and bending the Word to suite their desires. I am so sad that when a person genuinely seeking God comes here, the sum of this sub is what they find. 
Preach it!
"People sleep peaceably in their beds at night only because rough men stand ready to do violence on their behalf."\n\nThank you for your service and sacrifice on our behalf. \n\nAre you able to go into a little of how Delta is chosen or separated from other Army SOF? \n
Even as an ex-Californian who is very conservative and against all that these progressives stand for, I agree with you. Every time someone hears I  am from CA they look upon me cautiously. That is what CA liberals have done... branded every California native as a likely nutjob. 
So was Global cooling. Remember that? Or were you not born yet? 
Did you use Pico laser? How clear did they get? 
I have no idea how this isn't the top comment. Even nurses will tell you nothing is worse. I had a nurse tell that she would rather birth all 3 of her kids, AT ONCE, that suffer another kidney stone. \n\nDat Dilaudid tho...
I would refer you to a pretty well written article here: http://ccofal.org/TeaParty/Bible-illegal-immigration.phtml\n\nDo you honestly believe a nation is against God's principles if they have borders? Where do you find biblical justification of open, unbridled, illegal immigration? How many illegal immigrants are sleeping on your couch as of late? Surely you lock your front door at night... is that a Christian thing to do from your perspective? \n\nI will also note your "not welcoming strangers" line is a false statement. No one has said at all that immigrants aren't welcome. We are dealing specifically with the aspects of vetting the intentions of those who seek shelter here, as well as curbing the illegal entry of those who choose to ignore our laws and immigration system. \n\n
And a huge swath of those civilians are ex-military as well... even most CURRENT police and mil would side with the civilians in such a skirmish.

Under armor is famous for stabbing hunters and 2A in the back. They won't get my $$$
I would think you would be hard pressed to find such a thing ANYWHERE in the US, let alone very conservative Arkansas. \n\nThe Democrat parties platform and the Second Amendment are archenemies of each other, so don't expect anyone in those circles to have sympathy for a progressive ideal. Most gun owners vote Constitution first, above all other issues. That said, don't go in wearing a Bernie shirt or something like that and no one is going to ask about your political opinion.\n\nGo to an indoor range, pay for even just a few minutes of an instructors time, who will gladly help you select an appropriate rental firearm and eyes/ears (call ahead to ask policies... many ranges require either a party of two, or you to bring an existing firearm due to people trying to use rental guns for suicide), go over safety and good form, and have fun! \n\nI have taken many anti-gun folks shooting, and without fail their opinions rapidly change on their first trip out. In fact, one of those people now is an NRA certified instructor and teaches women's CCW classes. 
A wise decision. 
My children's teachers are all very vocal pro-Trump supporters. The parking lot is lined with MAGA bumper stickers. Not a Shillary supporter in sight. We have room for good teachers like this in AR. 
Do all gen 2's have a faux folding stock,\nOr is that like a CA version thing?
We call those "targets" in Arkansas. 
Our city has a massive shortage of tradespeople. No college needed, and the majority of them make more than college educated folks will. \n\nNo one to fill these jobs because everyone is sold on this fantasy that the only way to make it is to go to college. \n\nMeanwhile a drop out can get on the job training and be making 90-120k within 3 or so years and a great pension and we can't find anyone to do that because of this silly stigma. \n\nDone ranting now. 
Surely you have heard the accounts of people who have worked for Hillary Clinton, right? A stark contrast to be sure. 
Why weren't the scientists who claimed California would be in a massive drought for dozens of years able to predict that such a claim would prove completely incorrect just one year later? Why was the massive flooding and exponential rainfall such a shock to them?
Dirt covers it. and the bodies. 
This is why I would never date someone who is still "friends" with their ex. "Mike" dodged a huge bullet here. 
None of that lends credibility to your opinion. 
They are really censoring it. There is a big thing going on in conservative subs right now. 
You do know there has always been a legal way to enter the US, right? It's not as easy as some would like, but that is for a reason. It's not meant to allow anyone and everyone. There is no biblical basis for demanding such. 
Especially with a first name like Wolf. Sounds like a villain from the A-Team. 
I am curious as to how exactly they "helped him win". Could you elaborate?
Hmm I will check that out. Thanks!
I actually don't think helping to protect and conserve the environment is a bad thing. But when we start basing our entire world view around a made-up crisis that the sky is falling if we don't take massive steps that line the pockets of those who made up the crisis, that is when I jump off the train. I don't actually deny that the Earth may be going through a warming period. I don't even deny that humans are party responsible for making that worse. Finally, I don't deny that politicians and the like have ulterior motives for making the issue much more dramatic than it actually is. 
A friend of mine who works for a certain company in Palmdale, CA is very adamant that fusion reactors are about 30 years ahead of what the public and academia knows about. That is, small form factor, significant net-gain fusion power is a proven reality. 
So you think aiding and abetting a criminal is the "Christian thing to do", huh? Do you have no respect for the laws of our nation?  
Austin is actually trying to be San Francisco. It is a cesspool. 
Absolutely, and even then, the rebuke should be from a position of nothing but love. \n\nThis is nothing more than starting an argument with a pastor because you don't believe in creation. It is not a godly rebuke, born in love. Sometimes I forget pastors have to deal with people like this who think they know it all. \n\nIf OP is trying to find a church that does not believe in the book of Genesis, he is going to have a harder time than he is expecting. 
It may very well have been. There we several people, myself included, that saw the errors only with certain subs, but I won't rule out sheer luck of the draw. 
Only Conservative leaning ones. \n\nAnother "company" ran by butthurt children. 
Same here. I stuck with it, despite each episode being more poorly written and executed than the previous, because I figured "netflix paid for this. They paid for a season 2 for crying out loud! There must be some light at the end of the tunnel here (har har)!" and then came episode 8 and I got it. It is the story of extreme trauma and mental illness. When the girl came up to Prarie in the Olive Garden and talked about being beaten and raped and Prarie was like "no way... not me", I thought THAT was her reality... the story Prarie tells is her way of removing the painful reality from her mind. In all likelihood a "Hap" figure lured an already mentally-unstable young women from the NYC subway and kidnapped her. Maybe he hit her on the head during an escape attempt and her sight returned, but her reality was one of this world... she was subjected to the nightmare that so many who suffer this fate do. Bruises, beatings, rapes, hopelessness... and in it all, her mind found a way to cope by "leaving this world". Nothing supernatual actually happened - just a survivor of trauma... surviving.   \n\nSo they close with each of these 5 random people who fell for it going on about their lives, maybe a little more self-aware and less judgmental. as Prarie's fake world she created goes back to being a painful reality. All of the sudden, the story (still pretty badly written) is understandable. End it there. BUT NO!!!\n\nThe last 10 minutes just go to show there was no grand story arch or intelligent plan behind this... it is just scrambled lunacy. I am out. No season 2 for me. 
So from some ice cores you can determine that "global warming" is the greatest threat to mankind today? What of the predictions that have been so wrong about this in the past? 
Run. 
This is important to remember when we vote on libcuck polls. They can and will censor results from referral URL's. ALWAYS copy the URL into a fresh browser window.
Man I both love and hate this website. 
It has been working for an hour or so. Trust me... this morning it was a thing. Any URL with a referrer linking to certain subs was getting an "over capacity" page, which removing the referrer or changing it to a non-blocked sub was going through with no problem. It wasn't a random thing. There was some goofin' going on. Probably a lot like how Reddit "adjusts the algorithms". Wink wink. 
Didn't the guys father work for the Clinton campaign in Haiti? And the only thing he shot was the computer? 
A large swath of American citizens don't agree with your assessment. Just an FYI. 
Science isn't having 100 years of hard data over a million year period. That is called a guess. 
The "whosoever" part in Whosoever  believeth in Me... seems pretty all inclusive. Accept the Lord into your heart and you are saved. \n\nEven the Dutch. :)
You would think Under Armor would know their base as well, but they have a long history of slamming hunters (every hunter I know has boycotted their camo), 2A and now conservatives. I am proud to pass by an under armor tag now. 
idk about anal rape but truncheon rhymes with luncheon and I love a good luncheon so I am gonna give the cop a pass. 
Not at all. Around my part of the US everyone... EVERYONE has many guns, and even the most upstanding, 9-5 family men with mortgages and everything seemingly figured out would not blink at the thought of literally becoming a guerrilla fighter and killing politicians who tried to eradicate the 2nd Amendment, and any enforcers who tried to confiscate guns. \n\nI know some folks can't understand that, but I am not exaggerating at all. That thing Diane Finstein dreams of would literally spark a Civil War, and it would be impossible for the government to win. It would be an Iraqi insurgency times 10 million, and the vast majority of the police and military would side with the people, not the government. \n\nIt would literally be the dissolution of our Republic. I don't think outsiders (and many Liberals, to be honest), quite understand the gravity of messing with the Second Amendment. We will all kill and die over it. I would proudly do so. Everyone I know would do the same. We hold it as the cornerstone of our freedom, and see a world around us that is at the mercy of the powerful because they have no means of insurgency. We will never give that up. There is no bunker deep enough to hide those who would attempt to make us. 
The typical verses people quote on immigration deal with TEMPORARY immigrants. There is nothing in the Bible that says immigration laws are unjust and there should be no borders. Quite the contrary, as we are expected to respect the law of our lands...
Well to cover them with solid black will definitely have me still wearing long sleeves 100% of the time, along with the costs associated with doing the work (needless to say I don't have a free hookup any longer). I am not sure I gain anything. \n\nMy only real hope is to perhaps fade them enough with pico treatments (when money would allow... the full job is over 10,000.00) to have it not look like I have scarred arms, or maybe be able to cover them with something, but ultimately I don't want tattoo's period. I don't want to be looked upon like I am in the bank to rob them. I look "shady" enough without! 
Is there a legal means for the Administration to block ALL incoming immigration for 120 days? 
There is a lot of joking in the comments, but I gotta say, I respect the man. He said some wild things that turned out to be incredibly true when no one else had the guts to say it. 
I mean, I guess my only evidence is where Muslims (entire countries of them... by the tens of millions) deny rights to gays, women, and non-Muslims, and promote such ideals across the globe. Plus that whole "death to Jews" thing leads me to believe they might not be as willing to show unconditional love as we see here. \n\nIn contrast, I have never heard a Sikh say or do anything but show love to all. 
There are a lot of problems here, but a glaring one is the room mate thing. That is a bad idea all around. My wife and I got hard times from a layoff and had to room with her sister and husband for a few months. We were warned of the toll this would take, and the warnings were right. Marriages and room mates, ESPECIALLY COUPLES, are a bad mix. \n\n
As a parent, I absolutely want armed teachers, staff and parents at my children's schools. I am proud that my state is on track to allow that. 
Correct me if I am wrong, but Sikh's welcome EVERYONE to their charity. I doubt the same holds over in Muslim giving when the receiver is a Jew, homosexual, etc. \n\n
You are clearly very much invested in a Muslim ideal, and I can respect that. \n\nI am just calling it like I see it, and what I don't see is Sikh's doing any of the hateful things the vast majority of Muslims proudly display (in just about every geographical location I can think of). I don't think anyone can say with a straight face that Islam is a religion of "unconditional love". Now, it is true that not all Muslims are violent and the caricature that we see in the media so often, but you have to admit that there is a deep-rooted, near universal disdain for those who do not fit into their beliefs. Those beliefs don't exactly translate into a warm, welcoming soup kitchen for non-muslims. 
r/humblebrag
I was asking a rhetorical question. https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1462214\n
Mecca, Medina, and Dearborn. 
It would be very difficult to cover most of them up, at least with anything other than just a solid sea of black. 
Then let's call it as the Quran see's it...\n\nhttp://www.thereligionofpeace.com/pages/quran/violence.aspx\n\nYou can't argue with their holy book, right? 
Guess you guys shouldn't have lost every bit of power at the federal level and more than ever expected at the state level then, huh? "Elections have consequences", we were told. The liberal agenda is over.

Try "beaking" out, push your upper lip above your lower one. It's hard, but you'll get it eventually!
There can be a flip side though. My whore neighbor had some mid-life crisis and told her husband of like 20 years that she didn't want him anymore because some young guy she works with made her feel pretty or something. She threw her husband out and now she is instantly trying to get her younger kids to think of this new, MAYBE 22 year old guy as a father, just to spite their real dad. She tries to convince them that their dad was a bad person all of the sudden (known them for years and he is a good man)... and their kids come and tell my kids what she is doing. They are like 10 and they see through it. Their family is spiraling into insanity because of their crazy mother, and I can totally see a scene like this playing out a few months from now. \n\nShe is a psycho and I won't be shocked in the least if the ex-husband kills her soon. I just hope he does it somewhere else... property values might suffer. 
You don't understand American in the least. 
I have a wonderful family and a good job. I will kill the first persons through the door, without question. I can't think of a better way to die than standing up for my children's future liberty. Myself and as many as I can take with me will fall over the attempted confiscation of my guns. 
I think the reaction to this specific scenario lies in how solid your marriage is now. It sounds like it has been 9 years of really good, loving relationship. I can totally how this would be water under the bridge if that is the case. \n\nOn the flip side, I have a very close friend whose wife basically did something very similar. It was I think 5-6 years in the past when my friend found out (versus an admission, by the way). He couldn't get over it, even though they had a good relationship otherwise, because she was always very low libido with him. He couldn't get how she would turn him down, even back then, but not some random dude. They divorced and he is now remarried to a really awesome woman whom he feels is a much better fit, and all who know them agree. 
Speaking of illiterate, no where did I say YOU made the comparison. I stated generally that comparing the two (regardless of who did it) is a joke. Frat hazing is a joke. You are a joke. :) \n
I'm not going to go Googling for it, but suffice to say her SS detail hated her guts. 
No, it's because you are trying to bring failed liberal politics with you. 
Our local gun range sells targets with prints of UN helmets on them. :) 
I have a red one! Great bikes.
I either love or hate this bike. Not sure.
That's actually brilliant, not sad.
Yeah, $400 is a steal. Enjoy!
 Very snazzy dressers!
I used to play quite a bit, I would love to play some Call of Cthulhu one of these days.
Long Haul "Fucker," am I the only one that sees this? Sweet whip.
Sounds like a good deal, I'd get it if it fits you and is in good shape.
Guess it's time to stop lurking... 
At the end of the day, at the end of the day, etc...
But... But Nazis! 
So many great places to bike in town! Send me a PM if you want some details, there are plenty of biking groups around Kato for whatever kind of riding your interested in.
I love the Rapidan Dam Store, but it's in Rapidan... so how is it a top Mankato restaurant?
Dubs, I think. 
Dream ride! Enjoy.
Not much to fix other than a new chain. It's a single speed cruiser with a coaster brake, about as simple as it gets.\n
Sounds like Tenchi Muyo to me. 
I disagree, a place is only as bad as the people you surround yourself with! Mankato is a great town.
That's not a Varsity, that's an 80's Schwinn Sprint. Heavy and cheap entry level frame made by Giant. The Raleigh is far superior, IMO.
It really wounded me to, OP... Emotionally that is. Hopefully the sequel will have a better ending. 
A cross check can handle a LOT of dirt, even easy mountain bike trails. On the other hand, a troll is a bit more versatile for going off-road of that's your primary way to ride.
"Elektra"
Everybody play nice! 
Pretty good game! Fights are super sloooooow though, and kind of repetitive.
I made this mistake and lost my best Gravedigger (at the time) early on in the game. You live, you learn. (Well, *some* live...)
If the local bike shop has any sort of payment plans available, I would just go with that. An Allez is a great spec'd bike even at the lowest level, and as a new bike it'll probably have less "kinks" to work out than a used one. 
You should be able to appeal that ban...
Nice! The only detail I don't care for is the grip shifter on the drop bars.
**User:** /u/Chancellor740\n\n**Skill to Learn:** Flute\n\n**Previous Experience:** I've been playing various simple flutes (ocarinas, penny whistles, recorders, etc.), but the Concert C flute is much more complex and I really need to practice more.\n\n**Flair Request:** Yes!\n

Woah, got an internet tough guy here, watch out!
Realize that the feeling is temporary, and know that a lot of people feel the same way. That's what I try to do, anyway.
Ludicrous bricks! 
Looks like a Pacific Wal-Mart "Schwinn," I'd pass.
R/cringeanarchy and r/4chan are fairly Based. Also R/rightwingLGBT if that's your thing.  \n😉
I think r/leftwithsharpedge was banned for inciting violence or something.

I have a 1x1 I did something similar with, nice!
lol
Mankato is a very friendly town, and other than the harsh winters, I think you'd be able to transition just fine.
This has to be one of best gifs I've ever seen! A+++++ would enjoy gif again. 
I wouldn't call the Wine Cafe "woeful" exactly. It's just a relaxing place for people sick of college bars.
Not a terrible price, a little high maybe but as long as get $120 worth of riding out of it you're golden. In my market a bike like that would go for about $75.
Looks like someone is projecting... 
Yeah, you're better off. I've had a similar experience lately. 
\n\n🌶️🌶️🌶️🌶️🌶️🌶️🌶️🌶️🌶️🌶️
Don't worry OP, that'll buff out.
I love these old Treks! I have a Trek 1000 from around the same year that still rides great.
Pretty sure it's a parody account, either way well done! 
It's good! You should give it a try.
I have the same model bike as yours, good find for $250! Just make sure to lock it up and keep it indoors if possible. The largest tire you get get for it is 700x25 so I'd snag a good pair for commuting, either a Panaracer pasela or some Continental all seasons would do nicely.\n\nSpez: FYI I commuted on my sci 200 in Portland with no problems, just have a U Lock and leave it somewhere visible. 
Your life sounds awesome! Maybe join a club? If you're into motorcycles that's an obvious one.
What a track slayer!
16, kinda disappointing low.
Neat! I have a similar model in Red. Great bikes!
CTR Shill or expert troll... 
I don't know if I'd have the stones to do a century with no brakes!
These old Schwinn's are great for training your legs! Smooth rides too.
WS Transport is my favorite. Technically it's also a limo service so you can drink in their cars legally if you are so inclined. 
Brilliant! ☄️☄️☄️☄️
Yep! I've been doing it for months now, as other people have said, get a LOT of flute music books, a camera, etc. The Art of Flute Playing is a bit dry, but it's definitely the most comprehensive flute learning book I have. Another good one is The Jazz Method for Flute, which is detailed enough that even if you're not big into jazz the information in it is still rock solid for a foundation in technique.
Why are Satanists always so fat? 
double numbers, more than one number at a time, triples, or quads in rare cases.
I think it's pretty rad, OP, also would be a good bike polo rig.

I was in a similar position to yiu before I started lurking at T_D on the regular. I voted for GJ mostly hoping to get that magic 5% for the LP, but I was pleasantly surprised and not a little giddy at Trump pulling off the biggest electoral upset in history. Since then I've really liked a lot of what he's done. \n
I dug out the original: http://www.whompcomic.com/2012/12/10/dating-simian/

Wow, I've never seen this video, how embarrassing! I can't believe I actually voted in the primary for this spineless oaf. 
Excellent reference there ;)

That's more like it! More fire support! Keep it up, keep pointing out the utter **stupidity** of this State's officials and institutions so we can make them the laughingstock of the entire country!\n\n*P.S. It really does help us out here a LOT. Thank you.*
YES!!!! **Keep the incendiary memes coming; KEEP FIRING!!**\n\nSeriously, yesterday morning I heard some very liberal radio hosts talking about how stupid they thought the whole secession movement was, they theorized it had near zero chance of success, mentioned the economic devastation it would cause, recognized the problems to the idea posed by the numerous military installations here, and one of them even said he would leave if it ever happened.\n\nIt's working, **KEEP FIRING!**
Thanks for the continued fire support, T_D!
That sub gets harassed by delusional and unreasonable technophiles all the time.

His grip is atrocious and he looks like someone with near zero fortitude. His improper and reckless handling demonstrates an acute lack of firearms knowledge.

Wow there are people like this out there...lol
the nightmares were so real...happens every night and I would try so hard to force myself awake by slapping myself or jumping up to wake up before the thing chasing me got to me. I usually wake up around 2-3am consistently and it tires me for work at 5:30am. So far a month in and the dreams are still as vivid. It's like watching myself dying every night and its straight up annoying now.

Perhaps innocence, Ford said it was his saddest memory as a child about the racing greyhound.
Yes and especially on cow dung. The special kind can be easily grown in home as well which is way safer than going out picking them. I've gone a couple of times to the Oregon mountains to pick some really delicious non special ones though.

I too am in the same boat as you just not to your extent. Ive been on and off since 16 (now 20) and I also am introverted or shy whatever you want to call it. Weed disconnects me and ?i start to lose motivation in life like graduating college. Its hard and depressing but know your not alone on this. As for making friends, go to a church :p most of my closest friends are from church and we can always share the crap we go through in life.

Ford made it that way.
Exact same thing happened to me wtf. Especially that head from the ceiling jump scaring me while I was clearly awake. It was like those horror movies where you turn around and a ghostly succubus demon pops up and fades away. It's also strange how my vocal box thing wouldn't work, I would scream for help so someone can get me out of the paralysis but only that hoarse muffled sound. Happened when I was around 16 and again at 19, never want it again.
If this 1984 doesn't stop now then that is the direction this world is heading in. Censorship and normalization.

Holy moly that's clean. I'm building a table style 2 player currently and its pretty tough so I definitely respect your craftsmanship.
Other way around ;)

Enter the mecha era.
Same thing would have happened with Hillary tbh. Why was she in Goldman Sachs pockets? And we have her speech transcripts now. Everything sucks I guess.
They must, why did they even do it in the first place when eventually they will have to revert it. Fk u/spez fk you men.
My closest friends don't even reply to me when I respectfully ask their opinions on the whole pizza thing. They just don't care and that's mostly everyone I know but im here in the blue west.

I'm so happy we have the best memes. My non red pilled friends come at me with racial memes bleh.

Started with hating both candidates, now I'm here winning everyday with ya'll. feelsgoodman.
That thought spooked me out and we know there are people who have.
Wow we used the term gleeking as well here in Oregon, any other terms anyone? and yes middle school I saw some kids gleeking into people's hair and backs without knowing, joined the clan and learned the secret jutsu. useful when you want to use spit to clean something small but don't want that spit stench.
This is insane! I just don't get it anymore. 
I have a split tongue and can gleek so that's exactly how I feel.
Can never look at pizza the same again.
If you watch a little more carefully It revisits the scene where MiB closes the barn door. MiB aka older William does not rape her.
Those eyes have seen some shit, empty and lusting for power. 
Wow, at least know your poem inspired someone to keep at it. 8 days in and I forget why I tried to quit in the first place.
Will we ever see justice..
Three and a half bricks, please.
Orange meanie, small hands. End of discussion. (Lib logic)

Lol, that happened in 1948. If something like that happened today, the publicity and outrage would be enormous. Why did you rip my words out of context like that?\n
Cue deluge of "not all muslims" anecdotes.
Yes, you can.

Well, if social media counts as media, start with reddit:\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/2eh6rb/reddit_has_become_a_modern_sophisticated_version/?st=izhh8dfj&sh=5df490dc
It's very possible it wasn't 60 Minutes. This did occur to me, but I thought 60 Minutes would be a good starting point because it was my Dad's favorite news show. Thanks for checking though, I never would have gotten that far! I don't think I'll ever find it, because if I can't narrow it down to at least a few shows, it would be too broad of a net to cast.
Oh it's an editing mistake. They meant "Democratic Party Dies in Darkness"
So Shaia Lebouf can virtue signal via his crappy art project.
Exactly. It's completely pretentious garbage.

If I were to narrow it down, it would have most likely been CNN or CBS, because those were the two channels my dad preferred for news. He was pretty biased against NBC & ABC, thinking them too dumbed down. NPR is out because it was definitely on TV. It would have been an afternoon or evening segment because the TV didn't go on in the morning except for the Weather Channel (which I'm not even sure existed yet). Time constraint was definitely 1989 to 1990, because those were the years we lived in that house. \n\nIt was a pretty cool segment because they were basically predicting MP3's, although they got the medium wrong, since internet didn't exist yet, at least not for the average consumer, and they envisioned the storage medium as a big plastic cartridge (I remember them holding up a big black cart about the size of an SNES cartridge).\n\nCD's were a big deal at the time because they were just starting to overtake tape cassettes in the general market, so the next step beyond just seemed so futuristic.
I can has brick?
Wow I have never seen a landing gear like that before. 
No, but it sounds like it could go either way.
I'm completely baffled as to why this got so many down votes. The prevailing PoV on this subreddit seems to be that saying the media lies is not okay. I'm not sure where this sentiment is coming from, so if anybody can explain, I'm all ears.

As much as I dislike CNN, I doubt the Venezuelan government did it because they care about a well informed citizenry.
When I was a kid I used to think Toys R Us employees were the luckiest people in the world, being able to physically access those back rooms with the metal cages. (I've since then reevaluated my position on that)
The corrupt hypocrisy of the left hard at work. Very tolerant of Twitter to do that.
It'd be cool to design pinball machines, but I've seen the design docs for them, and they're insanely complex. I could learn to write the software for them, but as far as hardware design/engineering goes, nope. 
Caption is a spot-on description of the left: greedy, racist, and self-absorbed. Hypocrisy.

Ya that's a good point. I remember playing that spaceship game when Toys R Us had a demo unit on display. It was a pretty good game, but that thing gave me a headache, like, right away.
I tried to save the boxes and manuals but my parents made me throw them away.
If somebody can explain why it is so unpopular to assert that the media lies on this sub, I'm all ears.
We will pray for you.
Media is such a lying joke. 
This is a disturbing figure, and I believe it. \n\nThere will be revival. Think of all the heroin addicts who are the modern day lepers and outcasts of our society. A huge number of them will come to know Jesus. We are looking for the flock in all the wrong places. \n\nIt won't be the biblical scholars or high-ranking priests that the holy spirit falls upon. Jesus healed the sick and made the lame to walk again. He favored the humble, not the proud.
SIIIIIIIIIIIIIIICK

There's nothing nonsensical about recognizing that our immigration policy is too porous and there's certainly nothing nonsensical about not trusting the visa system. It's the policies and the current policy makers I don't trust, not the people taking and executing orders. People are sick of being told "everything is under control" when it clearly isn't. You can spout all the statistics & department names you want, but it's obviously a complete mess. I certainly don't have any confidence in these people you think so highly of.
Well I disagree that it's fearmongering. I think it's common sense to say it isn't safe or wise to renew visas without at least interviewing the visa holders, especially given the persistence of terror attacks committed by radicalized Islamists. It should be taken on a case-by-case basis, like you said.
Princess Mononoke?
How do you get a job assembling pinball machines?
That's like hitting an invisible block and getting a 1up!
Unless you're poor. Then you're just a poor uneducated redneck to be sneered at and talked down to.
Congrats & God bless to both of you. I wish you both the best!
Yeah... your point?
Really what needs to happen is for the screening process to become much more stringent. A blanket ban is obviously not realistic in the long term. Regardless, the initial screening process is only half of the story:\n\nhttp://www.cnn.com/2017/01/28/politics/text-of-trump-executive-order-nation-ban-refugees/\n\n"The order also calls for a review into suspending the Visa Interview Waiver Program, which allows travelers from 38 countries -- including close allies -- to renew travel authorizations without an in-person interview."\n\nThe other half of what is going on is that we are renewing visas without taking them on an individual basis, in other words, telling the world that the visa program is something you can not only rely on, but can also abuse to your heart's content. The reality is that it's way too easy for people to come and go as they please, regardless of their intentions. That isn't safe, nor is it wise.
We will pray for her!
Pretty sure her hat says 'cuck nation'
You're trying to twist my words into something entirely unrelated to my assertion, which is that discussion of non-Western hypocrisy is entirely off the table. \n\nIf anything, your attempt to derail me proves my point: pessimistic criticism of the West is the only acceptable narrative, and discussion beyond that is off the table. \n\nClearly you hate Christians and Christianity, so I don't expect a meaningful response from you. You have your master and I have mine.\n\nThe last word is yours.
Not that I'm literally looking for a job as random as that; just that SOMEONE does it for a living, and it sounds like a pretty cool job, if not the highest paying.
Nailed it.
Will probably take a lot more than a petition. Definitely needs to happen.
He's gonna eat that applesauce, and he's gonna SMILE.
I think modern Christianity, and more broadly Western culture, has itself pinned to the wall with this narrative of universal acceptance. \n\nHypothetically, if these were Christians massacring Muslims, the condemnation would be off the charts. But since it is Christians being killed, there is no reaction at all.\n\nI don't understand why this mandate of tolerance only applies to Westerners, and any discussion outside of that rigid spectrum is off the table. \n\nTo me, it smells of group-think.
My CFI did. I know nobody really does irl, but I like it.

Congrats. Super jealous!
Revival. There is going to be a lot more of it. We have had such a heroin epidemic in the US, and all of the doctors, experts, activists, politicians, and scholars have acted like the addicts don't even exist. A huge number of them will come to know Christ, because society has turned its back on them. Jesus chose the humble to shame the proud.
HAH Jersey City civil servants? I'm sure they're an honest, upright bunch.

The Patricarchy and Dreams: What You Need To Know (And Why You Should Be Outraged)
Yes, but why would you want to emulate virtual boy at all?
Leftist extremism. Only a total wuss would think to be offended by the fact he's drinking from a jug.
Selling your soul to the devil isn't possible. That's just Satan messing with your head. If a thought is causing you to feel fear or doubt, it isn't coming from God, it's coming from the adversary. 
Not a pickup. Bought it at the Post Oak Mall Babbage's in College Station, TX in '96!
Very nice! I LOVE the impact printing on the label. Hearkens back to a simpler, less polished age of PC gaming, when every byte was a treasure!.
If I saw that out of context, bootlegs wouldn't come to mind. I'd just be like, "Police? Wtf?" \n\nGreat work, though. It does look really awesome. I could never do something like that.
And I'll form the head!
"Why would you think you are in a better position to determine who needs an interview than that visa officer is?"\n\nI guess it boils down to a lack of trust. Why would I trust the judgement of people who talk down to me for speaking openly and honestly? In my experience, people possessed of that kind of arrogance are the ones who think they know more than they actually do. Why should I take anything you say at face value?\n\nIt shouldn't come as a surprise that credentials don't do much to calm peoples' doubts about the system, i.e. don't translate into credibility. As long as Muslim extremists are killing people in our borders, it's a failed program. 
When you realize that's only a map of Stockholm... and there are 18 no-go zones in one city alone.

Yeah, of course The Blaze is stirring the pot. Fuck Glenn Beck.
Trevor Noah is the least funny person to host a television show. And that's saying something, since Samantha Bee also hosts a show.
I believe they will come to know Jesus sooner than we think. The country has been spiritually impoverished for about 40 years now. Many of these people grew up without ever having heard the Gospel or stepped foot in a church. They don't know what they're seeking for yet, but they are yearning. \n\nThe liberal churches are too busy debating theology and trying to be intellectually profound to take notice of the very people they are supposed to be helping. They hypocritically treat "uneducated rednecks" and "white trash" with pity at best and utter contempt at worst. \n\nA lot of conservative churches aren't any better because they don't want to lose social status in their own tight-knit communities. They won't have anything to do with the poor kid from the wrong side of the tracks, especially if he has ever broken the law. \n\nWe're going through enormous cultural shifts right now, and it has only begun. This sort of instability is extremely fertile ground for revival. The 60's and 70's had great revivals, and possibly greater ones are in the near future. \n\nIt may look bleak now, but these things start with tiny sparks of faith and spread like raging wildfires. It may not necessarily start in your neck of the woods, or even mine for that matter. But it will start somewhere with a few faithful souls who want to spread word of God. Then it will grow into a nation-wide movement. Pray, have faith, & God bless.

Wow, this might have been it. It certainly fits the feel of what I'm recalling. I'll have to plow through the series to confirm that. I have a pretty distinct image in my head of that scene. That image is decades old, so I may have embellished it over time. Nevertheless I'm sure I'll know it if I see it!
Bummer, but I'd say first dibs is better than a discount!
George Will also thought Trump would lose the Republican nomination. Cucks gonna cuck.
Give this guy a round of applause!
Came up empty handed. The first one (1972) had a scene that was really close, where the women are freaking out trying to load a rifle in a house in the middle of nowhere at night, but they never go outside and shoot it. \n\nThe second one (1977) came nowhere close, and somehow managed to be more of a train wreck than the first movie. \n\nThe third one I've seen multiple times because it was an MST3K feature, and I can say with certainty that it isn't the right one either.
I wish California would just secede already. Let them have their welfare nightmare all to themselves.

And of the current top 3 (Le Pen, Macron, Fillon) - Le Pen's only real chance is going up against Macron. Fillon and Le Pen are both right wing, but Fillon is more moderate - meaning the entirety of the left will back him. Macron, however, is center-left AND a europhile/open borders guy. Le Pen would have a chance to capture the entire right and the euroskeptic/anti-refugee parts of the left.
She didn't do it for policy. She's trying to get name recognition for when she runs for President. She's already approached Clinton donors to see if they'd fund her, so I imagine she'll be making a run in the near future as Hillary 2.0.

IR and Rumble wouldn't necessarily be required for game specific joycons. Don't be surprised to see them bundled in with a game. Granted, they would likely be in a Deluxe SKU of some kind. \n\nExample: \n\nPokemon Snap - $59.99\nPokemon Snap w/ Special Edition Joycons(s) - $89.99

Unless their iris recognition technology has drastically improved since my Note 7, then I cannot agree. If someone wears glasses, it is mostly useless. Even those who don't will have issues using iris unlocking in sunlight. Not to mention the fingerprint reader was at least twice as fast.

I can confirm that this is happening on many Android phones, not just the Pixel. I had 7 people today come into my shop with the same issue. Most were Samsungs but there was one Pixel in the mix. Also the issue with the Google Now page not populating.

I see. Seal team 6 I take it?
>make ridiculous claims\n>says common knowledge \nBro, the brits kinda hated hitler and tried to kill him many times. I'm sure more times than the public even knows. It would have put public morale through the roof.

Yea but they were pulling out of that when he said that. America didn't really get out of it until arms demand skyrocketed and they could rebuild their economy on the backs of the allies. 
I honestly think it's pretty funny.

Thank you for your service sir!
Already did. Still nothing 
The us wasn't on a sustainable path either. The new deal would have plunged us into debt if it wasn't for the war. 
Really no. Germany was pretty much out of it by 1936. To contrast America was in the worst of it by 1936. 
Do you have this saved and copy paste it? It seems the same every time i see it. 
Accurate af holy shit 
They were fanatically nationalistic. That is a good thing for a country no?
Oh, I was referring to the massive inflation of Germany pre hitler. I'd look into it if I were you, it got so bad that people would have to be paid multiple times a day, different amounts, just so they would be able to pay for food. And I'm not defending hitler, I'm defending the historical record. I'll say this now hitler was a bad hombre, but this specific quote is not bad and it is in fact true. 
Well yea, I don't really want to get into a alternate history debate right now, but obviously things would have been different if they won the war. 
Why do fascists always have cool flags?
Tbh Danzig should have been given to Germany without a war. 
There is a difference between defense of our society and having special snowflake syndrome. 
Sorry, I'm used to r/the_donald. 
But you would have to have it made special. Wouldn't it be easier just to go to the store and buy a flag?
The [worldport](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Worldport_(Pan_Am) had a very similar system around the same time. It's a safe bet that jet bridges had not been invented yet. 
Mate I'm a fascist. I am all about the state and strength of the people. These people weaken the state and unity in general. 
No that was before hitler. Hitler had to go in and fix it. 
_heritic_
I don't hate anyone based off their race. I just realize that different races are better at different things. Look at the 100 meter dash for example. Is it racist that the majority of winners are black? I realize that different races are good at different things. I also believe all races have the right to exist in their own homeland. The Jews have Israel, the arabs have pretty much the entire Middle East the Africans have most of Africa but Europe is being filled with non whites. 
>we are better than them\nI was referring to animals. 
Oh no it's no secret I'm alt right I'm not gonna hide it. But when you put something on the front page it's bound to attract all political ideologies. 
Papa Bless
Started. But hitler put what was needed behind it to finish it. And either way, you can only build so many roads and dams. Same with tanks, both were unsustainable, but Hitler's plan was to conquer land and use that to build the German economy. 
THOSE ARE RUSSIAN SEALS YOU FUCKING COMMIE
Well on Inauguration Day I was quite excited and wore my make America great again hat and shirt. That pissed off a lot of people living in dark blue Massachusetts. Listen, if you don't like President Trump that's fine but threatening to shoot up a school over it is not the solution. 
Thank god. It's about time. Instead of feeding the delusion we should treat it. 
Yea that's about accurate tbh. I'm quite sick at the moment and haven't left the house in days. I think I got the flu.

I was in a bullion once and got yelled at for training. Mind you they used 3 trunks on a lvl 12, I use a fog horn because I'm working on maxing it out and they yelled at me. But the 3 trunks wouldn't have killed the 12 anyway. I was pissed after that. 
I'm not saying it's a good thing I'm just stating the facts. 
Culture mixing isn't good though. Think of it like dogs. We have German shepherds and Doberman, would you use those dogs for the same thing? No, you would use them for different tasks. Why dose this apply to every species but human?
Yes you did. Congratulations. Pick any prize from the middle shelf. 
We are better than them but some principles still apply to the both of us. And there is a difference between multiculturalism and multiraceisim. Multiculturalism would be like having a French restaurant a German restaurant and an Italian restaurant on the same street. I have no problem with that. Multiraceisim is having a Italian restaurant a Kenyan restaurant and a Japanese restaurant on one street. That is what we would have a problem with. Now the metaphors I used was about restaurants, but if you put those people together that's where we get a problem. 
All apartments should be built like this. Put a pool in the middle or something. I mean the entire middle do you can just jump in from your window.

I mean the earlier seasons were way better, can't deny that, but I think the show now is above average for comedy's. keep in mind we have shows like Mike and molly. I was just shitting on it to get on the band wagon tbh
Well that is because they had more factories. Germany also was building more factories or war as part of the plan. 
I mean hitler said this in the midst of the Great Depression.  America was a pretty shit place back then.

So are you saying that you feel males are more dangerous than females? 
She committed a crime by stealing a social security number for personal use. If we couldn't separate mothers who commit crimes from their children then we couldn't put many women in jail and this is sexist towards fathers who commit crimes. She knew the laws and the risks she was taking when she came here illegally and then committed the crime. Only she is at fault for the predicament she put her children in. Now if they want to see her they can drive on down to Mexico.
So I'm a parent who lives in a horrible school district that has a mix of good and bad teachers but has a problem with violent, drug dealing, gang member students, but I'm also a parent that can't can't afford private school. So where should I send my children to get an education? \n\nSee here is the problem, if there were no such thing as a free charter, I'd have to send my kid to an unsafe traditional public school where they can't learn because of student interruptions. I cant just wait around for the government to come in and transform the public schools. Waiting would possibly destroy my child's education and jepordize their safety. So you say charters and private schools aren't the answer. So what is my answer right now?
Lol, you can see all the little "Oh shit what if my worldview is based on false information then who am I " moments. Bet she'll be red pilled in a few months.
It's important to note that while many people hate him, many people love him and others are undecided. The problem is you likely have a false impression based on what you see in the news and on social media. Nearly all news corporations and their affiliates are owned by a small handful of democrats. It's not a secret that the owners/ upper management of places like Twitter, Reddit , Google and Facebook are also are against Trump. There have been thorough examinations of these organizations and it was discovered evidence of suppression of anything pro Trump as well as manipulation of things like post and search rankings. Out in the real world in America, it's a totally different atmosphere. For example in my rural area, out of my 150 Facebook friends, less than 8 hate Trump. In America there are these highly concentrated areas of liberals usually in larger well known cities along the coastal areas that are heavily democrat but in all of the thousands upon thousands of smaller more rural places scattered everywhere else in between, folks tend to lean republican. 
Being hesitant to discuss it doesn't mean one will abstain from discussion of the issue altogether. However the risk repercussions will certainly affect the conversation overall. Like the Swedish police officer who recently came forward with his concerns. He had the concerns for a while but was hesitant to discuss them.
I think it should be left up to a parent to decide when their minor child is old enough to take the risk of entering male or female bathroom alone. A female can also sexually assault a minor. I personally like the method many retail places use with having single restrooms or a third family restroom.
I think you must be getting me confused with a different poster considering I didn't say nor imply you didn't have the original link and for the third time *I didn't post a link from Breitbart.* Or it could be that your use of multiple accounts is causing you confusion. \n\nI knew that you were refusing to read Brietbart's content but I wanted to see if you would take it as far as to also refuse to use OP's Brietbart link to access alternate content. Essentially what you are doing is using is ad hominem dismissal in order to cowardly avoid any discussion that may bolster OP's claims. 
Supposedly she was two weeks pregnant which means the only way they could've known she was pregnant with twins is through a blood test that checked her HCG hormone levels. At two weeks pregnant, it's the time a woman would start her period if she hadn't conceived. \n\nThat soon into a pregnancy it would be hard to prove a kick to the stomach caused a miscarriage considering 1 in 4 recognized pregnancies end in miscarriage with possibly many more miscarrying before the mother knows she's pregnant. It's also more common for twin pregnancies to fail. The pregnancies that end without the woman realizing will often seem like a heavier than normal period. My guess is she only knew she was pregnant because they did routine blood work when she was examined after the attack at the hospital and soon after she started bleeding. It's entirely possible that if she wasn't attacked she would've started her period having never known she had conceived and was miscarrying. Either way it is still horrible she was attacked and she can never know what might have been. 
36 hours. Ten year old had a bad reaction to anesthesia after a spinal fusion. She was admitted to the PICU until she stabilized. She's fine now. Hospitals are a fucking awful place to be awake for long periods. 
There isn't a history of transgender people assaulting others in bathrooms but there is a history of men assaulting other men, children and women in bathrooms including cases where the man dressed as a woman to gain access to the ladies facilities. People aren't afraid of transgender people assaulting others in bathrooms rather they are afraid of folks pretending to be transgender. I think what the other poster is referencing is a way to insure that only actual transgender folks are allowed in. 
Technically what he admitted to doing is attempting to make out with women before he asks permission if he can. Do all people ask the person they are interested in if they have permission to kiss them or do they often wait for a moment between them and then act? I'd say it's the latter in which case nearly everyone is guilty of sexual assault. 
It seems in your opinion bathrooms are segregated for gender *identity* rather than biological sex or at least they should be. Is this a correct assumption? \n\nSome would argue the opposite in that bathrooms should be segregated based on biological sex rather than gender identity. \n\nUsing some of your words here they would argue that it is trans people who cannot cope with using bathrooms segregated by biological sex and it is not the responsibility of the world to pad itself because of a small group of people who identify as trans. They would argue transpeople are responsible for their own shit. The world is not.\n\n Take it a step further and some would argue that cisgender people need to learn to accept the fact that others do not comply to societies gender norms. An example, they would say that heterosexual males who identify as men need to learn to accept sharing a restroom with males who identify and present themselves as women, with homosexual males, with non-binary males, etc. \n\nIn your opinion, why is it a better long term solution to make bathrooms segregated by gender identity rather than to segregate them by sex and move society towards being fully accepting of those who do not conform to gender norms? 
That sounds like a beautiful and noble goal and I wish all children the best of luck. But rich elites who send their kids to private school will *not* mandate my kids go to schools they wouldn't send their kids to. Hell will freeze over before anyone forces me to send my kids back and hundreds of thousands of other families feel the same way. So here's what must happen. They will let us keep our charters and  private schools and in the meantime they can fix the public school system. Once it's fixed, we'll come right on back.  
No, but the writer's native language isn't English. Obviously an info fishing scam. 
Glad your kid is ok too:)
Since within OP's single link there is an easy way to access all the links needed to fulfill your requirement, sources other than Breitbart, it seems to me it would be kind of a pointless waste of time for OP to copy paste them all here individually. 
Personally I don't think any bill should be passed for or against. Bathrooms seemed to be working just fine before. I say we give absolutely no one any rights other than to use the bathroom that corresponds to their sex. It's about damn time that cisgender people become comfortable with the notion that gender identity doesn't always match with one's sex. Men need to be comfortable with the notion that some folks born male identify as women and accept sharing a bathroom with folks that present as women and vice versa for females. I mean, if a cisgender male really wanted to assault a transperson he can do so whether she is using the stall next to him or the women's bathroom across the hall. 
Lol he mad
The problem is in the numbers. When a tiny portion of people from a different culture move into an area, they are sort of forced to assimilate as they interact with mostly people from the host culture. If too many come in and live in an area together, they don't have to assimilate. They can maintain their culture in their own little bubble, live, work and play with people just like them. If the newcomer group grows large enough, then they start making demands that the host culture change to accommodate their sensibilities. People used to come here more organically but now we are bringing in thousands at once, many from very different cultures that don't mesh well with modern societies. 
And? How does that change anything at all? One can express oneself freely except with this admittedly fuzzy list of rules attached? The man was doing exactly what I described. He was talking about immigrant related crime. How did it suddenly become a criminal offense when he went on to add to that *why* he thought the immigrants committed such crimes explaining it pertains to the culture in the area the immigrants came from. What good does it do to discuss crime rates if people can't discuss possible reasons for such crime rates? Both should be legal and acceptable forms of free speech. 
Why is it always Florida?
Michael Hess, a local politician from Sweden Democrat Party, encouraged Swedish journalists to get acquainted with Islam’s view of women, in connection with the many rapes that took place in Cairo’s Tahrir Square during the “Arab Spring”. Hess wrote, “When will you journalists realize that it is deeply rooted in Islam’s culture to rape and brutalize women who refuse to comply with Islamic teachings. There is a strong connection between rapes in Sweden and the number of immigrants from MENA-countries [Middle East and North Africa].”\nThis remark led to Michael Hess being charged with “denigration of ethnic groups” [hets mot folkgrupp], a crime in Sweden. In May last year, he was handed a suspended jail sentence and a fine — the suspension was due to the fact that he had no prior convictions. The verdict has been appealed to a higher court.
Sometimes I wonder if my family thinks I might poison them because I wonder if they might poison me but I won't poison them because I love them but I can't be sure if they love me but if I can't be sure if they love me then they can't be sure I love them so sometimes I wonder if my family thinks I might poison them.
So here is where I think the real problem is and it's not funding. No matter how much money you invest in excellent teachers, the best equipment and buildings, etcetera, that absolutely will not change the fact that in some districts too many of the children have zero support at home. They come to school lacking food, sleep, supplies, proper clothing. They don't get help with homework and no discipline or they are abused. The main reason why so many of the parents in my district remove their kids from public school is they don't like the fact that the public school can no longer separate the well behaved kids from the struggling  troublemakers. It's that simple. The vast majority of parent complaints can all can be traced back to those children's home issues as the root cause. Class interruptions, violence, bullying,  all lead to things like poor academic performance and high teacher turnover. So what parents are doing is putting their kids in the schools that can and will kick out those problem kids. \n\nThe only solution that will save public schools is being able to separate the kids by skill level, placing kids with severe behavioral problems in separate schools, milder problems in different classrooms and offering paths to trade schools rather than just college prep. But here's what would happen if this was proposed. Because larger percentages of minorities are doing poorly and have behavioral problems, it will be protested against as racist. Right now, in some local schools, 60% of white and Asian kids are performing at grade level while less than 10% of minorities are. And these are classes where all the kids get the exact same education and sit side by side. It's ludicrous to put 10 year old kids who can barely read level 1 books in a class with kids reading at grade level and claim its good because it's "inclusive".  For those kids sake, they need all day, intensive instruction in classes with just a handful of students. Until these things happen, we will not see parents putting their kids back in public schools. The changes will need to happen first without the support of school choice parents. Then, if the the public schools improve, parents will come back. 
I often wonder how many of these hate receipts have to be proven to be hoaxes before most people will consider the possibility of fraud when a new one pops up? 
Black on white murders are usually crimes of opportunity. Run of the mill robbery gone bad sort of cases. You will usually see local news articles and every now and then one gains publicity if it has some sort of aspect that makes it stand out from the rest such as torture. MSM doesn't cover a lot of run of the mill cases of any demographic group.\n\n I'm not sure racism is caused by black on white crime because their isn't much actual racism anymore. However, prejudices are caused by crime, specifically prejudice towards young, black males. But everyone is guilty of this including other black people. Prejudice is a natural human response everyone has. Being able to determine a threat based on past experience or knowledge is an innate survival mechanism. Turning one's prejudices into racism against an entire group is when it becomes a problem.
According to the theory, outside circumstances can change a person from an r to a K which would explain why someone can change and why people become more conservative as they age. 
I rarely think about genitalia however this particular topic is centered around all things gender related. One argument that some have against trans people using shared locker rooms and shower facilities has to do with being uncomfortable being nude around someone who hasn't had sex reassignment surgery. The particular person I questioned is someone who often has different opinions than myself but I enjoy reading their opinions and they are generally a polite debater which can be hard to come by on Reddit. 
It sort of reminds me of the situation with race/police related riots in the U.S. If you live here you know that the vast majority of people get along just fine and unless you live near a bad area then you're safe. But I've seen comments from foreigners that imply they think it's like the Wild West over here with gun slinging white folks and police officers gunning down anyone who isn't white. Even though it's not like that we do have problems that need to be addressed just like Sweden has problems that need to be addressed. I think what's frustrating Swedish folks is the fact their government won't let them openly discuss the issues which is making the situation worse.  
A lot of what you're seeing is self segregation based on income with more minorities living in low income neighborhoods. And when politicians try to split up those school districts to force them to desegregate, it creates a host of problems. You wind up with situations like half of the kids in one neighborhood go to one school, the other half go to a different one with many kids being placed in schools away from their childhood friends. Often such moves mean bus routes have to be longer forcing some kids to spend hours in transit and higher costs. Then you have issues with which ever demographic group is the smallest in number in a particular school gets singled out and bullied. You also end up with one school being the best and safest, usually the school with the least low income pupils, so parents of all demographic groups will either move nearby or lie about their address to be able to enroll their children. What inevitably happens is people grow tired of lacking the ability to send their kid to their preferred school and they either move away from the district, choose to homeschool or find a charter. Slowly but surely the schools will segregate themselves again. \n\nThis is what happened in a county near my home after decades of strong efforts to force segregation. They proposed another round of splitting the districts up again but it wasn't financially possible  as it would just force even more kids out of the local public schools and they had already lost a lot money and had to eliminate a bunch of positions because of reduced enrollment. 
why has this turned into r/politics. can't escape anywhere on this website. Anyone have any suggestions for an alternative to reddit?
It's certainly not 100% fool proof but some doctors will use it saying it *may* be indicative of more than one baby. That's the only thing that makes sense as the gestational sac wouldn't even be visible at two weeks after conception. 
Well it seems you get plenty of carbs and eat frequently which is good for adding weight. But to add to what /u/co99950 said, often skinny people don't realize they unintentionally do mini fasts. So one day they will eat a lot but the next day they won't. What happens is they usually eat less calories than others but even if you ate the exact same amount of calories every 24 hours as someone else, if you eat those calories within a small time frame of let's say 4 hours, then your body will burn more of its own stored fat than someone who spreads out the calories evenly over 24 hours. It's called 'intermittent fasting' and people use it as a technique to lose weight when it stalls during dieting. 
To be fair wealthy people usually have excellent accountants. Couple that with multiple businesses, lots of assets and real estate and there are a shit ton of ways to use these things to pile on write offs to reduce taxes. The methods aren't illegal and it would be stupid as hell to not use these lawful methods to save money.
Part of me thinks Rubio plays the role of good cop then feeds info to the republicans. 
I have no idea. That's a better question for the OP who mentioned their ideas about enforcement. Again, I was simply pointing out the fact that people are concerned about those folks who pretend to be transgender for nefarious purposes
You're correct in that this article doesn't show the differences in how amount of spending affects test scores by comparing states to one another rather it's shows that even after adjusting for inflation the vast increases in spending haven't improved outcomes. NCLB started in 2002 but spending increases started long before then with statistically no positive affects before or after NCLB that could be tied to spending. I felt this was a better way to explain that correlation doesn't equal causation because there are other factors that affect individual school districts funding that may make it seem as if the money alone affects outcome. For example, some wealthy suburban school districts may receive a lot of money but those districts are also filled with more two parent households. So is it the money that improves the district or the fact that the parents who contribute the money improve the district? Thirty plus years of data of increased spending for all districts should show improvements if spending was tied to achievement.\n\nWhat this paper shows is and this a quote from the paper: \n\n"Consistent with those patterns, there has been essentially no correlation between what states have spent on education and their measured academic outcomes. In other words, America’s educational productivity appears to have collapsed, at least as measured by the NAEP and the SAT." \n\nFurthermore, and this is more telling IMO, is not only do spending increases not affect outcome but decreases also don't affect outcome. Also from the paper: \n\n"Not only have dramatic spending increases been unaccompanied by improvements in performance, the same is true of the occasional spending declines experienced by some states. At one time or another over the past four decades, Alaska, California, Florida, and New York all experienced multi-year periods over which real spending fell substantially (20 percent or more of their 1972 expenditure levels). And yet, none of these states experienced noticeable declines in adjusted SAT scores—either contemporaneously or lagged by a few years. **Indeed, their score trends seem entirely disconnected from their rising and falling levels of spending**."\n\nBut to be more specific to my original comment, read this [article](http://www.forbes.com/sites/jamesmarshallcrotty/2014/02/12/infographic-higher-education-spending-does-not-correlate-with-better-academic-performance/#6a22a50c512f). In the article it states that New York state spends the most on education at $19,076 per student, yet ranks 40th in rates of high school graduation. Oklahoma spends $7,587 per student, yet ranks 27th. Even accounting for cost-of-living differences, the per-capita spend is far higher in New York than in Oklahoma. \n\nNow this will not hold true for every instance of course. There will be cases where increases in spending seem to improve overall outcomes rather than just looking at test scores. But what many such statistcs don't show is what changes were made concerning **how the money is spent**. [Here](http://www.npr.org/sections/ed/2016/04/25/468157856/can-more-money-fix-americas-schools) read this article that discusses the importance of where the money goes. I think you will really like this article because it does cover cases in which money helps. However, note that it covers spending money to address areas I spoke about earlier in our thread. Low income students need smaller classes and more options to a path to graduate with less focus on test scores. Also note that improvements made seem to only statistically improve  outcomes for low income students. In other words, rather than equally funding schools, some districts need much **more** funding than others but spent wisely. Again, this funding would cover issues I spoke about earlier. \n\nAs a volunteer parent at an improvised school district what I would like to see is later starting school times and smaller neighborhood schools. Cheaper, smaller, easy to carry books. Free after school care, including summer daycare as well as food programs that lasted year round with free professional tutoring services and counseling offered every day. Free coats, uniforms and shoes. Free medical and dental check ups twice a year done at the school. Class rooms with no more than 8-10 students with two teachers in each class. At least one hour of free play time. And last but not least, trade school training options starting in 9th grade. These things would cost a lot of money of course but I believe can be done if schools weren't just funded equally but the districts that needed it were properly funded and managed correctly while wasteful spending was eliminated.
That's exactly why for the sake of transgender people Charlotte needs to repeal their ordinance but then so does the State of NC. We don't need regulations about bathrooms other than issues like providing disability accessible rooms of course. There is too much room for abuse no matter which stance one takes. \n\n While places like Charlotte make good intentioned regulations saying people who identify as transgender can use whichever gender segregated facility they choose including shower rooms, often they don't think it through. Essentially what they've done is given an open invitation for any sexual deviant criminal who statistically are much more likely to be male, to abuse the ruling without providing any way to separate the deviants from actual transgender people. Such regulations are already being abused in places like Seattle where a man who appears to have made no effort to transition is using the ladies room because there are no safeguards within their regulations to prevent this. So now the very people transwomen and cisgender women were trying to avoid by using the ladies room, are coming into the ladies room with them. Even many of the democrats in NC see big issues and loop holes with Charlotte's ordinance and feel it was poorly thought out. In my personal opinion no bathroom ordinance is better for all but I'm not opposed to a well thought out solution. \n\nThanks for discussing the issue cordially with me btw. 
Why in the world do you keep trying to assume what I think lol? Also you do realize that I'm a women too right? Tell you what, try to clear your assumptions and reanalyze my statement keeping in mind the following: I'm a woman, I'm a centrist concerning politics particularly note I'm perfectly fine with transgender restrooms, I never said that men would actually abuse transgender bathroom policies rather I said some women *fear* they will. \n\nThe only thing I was pointing out is how similar this trans person's reasoning is for wanting to use the restroom they identify with as compared to women who are against transgender women using their bathroom. The reason I pointed it out is it's always helpful to understand where people are coming from is it not? It seems to me that if women on both sides of the issue could find some common ground, they can move forward together. People expect cisgender women to understand a transgender women's perspective to the point they are accepting but personally I feel both sides will benefit from looking at the situation from the other's perspective with compassion and then having some healthy discussions. But, as you can see, people are so sensitive over the topic that often discussions, other than absolutely trash talking the opposition, even reasoned discussions from supporters, is often met with false assumptions and hostility. \n\nSo let's start over. Let me ask you your opinions. How do you feel about women, who because of past trauma, are truly afraid of transgender bathrooms? What do you think would be a good way to bridge the gap between the groups? Do you think some compromises are ever a good solution? For example, I think you may be surprised but many of the fairly liberal supporters I know support transgender issues and the right for trans people to use their restroom of choice but at the same time they don't support the idea of people who haven't completed a sex change operation having access to showers and locker rooms that don't have privacy stalls. How do you feel about some sort of compromise such as adding single use showers and changing areas for trans people who choose not to have reassignment surgery? 
How can you possibly determine whether or not my words are 'dripping' with anything? I think perhaps you are making false assumptions about the nature of my statement which tends to be an issue for many when reading someone's words as it can be difficult to determine a writer's tone. Generally I find it's a bigger issue when the reader is affected by the topic personally. Are you or someone you know a former convict?
If you want to reduce your taxes legally then you can hire an excellent accountant to give you a list of all the write offs most people aren't familiar with.
Some of the worst performing schools receive the most funding. Funding won't fix a broken, drug and crime riddled home. Give equal funding to a suburb school where nearly all of the kids have at least one involved parent vs a poverty stricken neighborhood school where most kids don't have an involved parent and the outcomes will be vastly different. 
Do you mean numbers of cisgender males filming and/or assaulting other males in men's rooms for sexual gratification? As far as I know, there hasn't been a good study concerning the amount of voyeurism and assaults specifically in male bathrooms. I can find individual cases similar to those I listed above but no datasets. I too would like to see the data. 
I think thats a balanced, fair approach. What is your opinion about segregation in rooms such as locker/ changing rooms and showers/saunas in which there are no privacy barriers? 
Yep, that's one of the few things I remember. It was the country above us where a bunch of French people settled and they club baby seals. 
The fact that you think that the religion of Islam doesn't support rape and domestic violence shows me you know little about Islam. The prophet himself raped captive women. Physical abuse of wives is allowed in Islam: Men are (meant to be righteous and kind) guardians of women because God has favored some more than others and because they (i.e. men) spend out of their wealth. (In their turn) righteous women are (meant to be) devoted and to guard what God has (willed to be) guarded even though out of sight (of the husband). As for those (women) on whose part you fear ill-will and nasty conduct, admonish them (first), (next) leave them alone in beds (and last) beat or separate them (from you). But if they obey you, then seek nothing against them. Behold, God is most high and great.
Check this bullshit out. I had to go see a shrink for 3 visits. I'm an adult but had to bring 2 family members to attest to my ADHD. I took the Adderall with no complications or signs of abuse, no weight loss, no lost pills, etc for 12 months. Then I moved and switched doctors. New doctor forced me to submit to 3 months of pee tests, followed by pee tests every 6 months followed by random pee tests and one random blood test. One $400 test was solely to check for the presence of the Adderall in my pee and the insurance company wouldn't cover it. This is still happening after more than 5 complication free, perfect health, years of taking this one and only scheduled medication. I am a stay at home mom who home schools. How in the hell can I go every 5 days to pick up an RX? I'm as close to June Cleaver( albeit foul mouthed with the sense of humor of a teenaged boy) as a mom can get. I guess the fam won't be getting any more chocolate espresso tortes with organic raspberry sauce. I'll be too busy finding my fucking car keys.
"Approximately 150 of 160 people detained had criminal histories, according to ICE. Of remaining immigrants without a criminal records who were taken into custody, five had final orders of removal or had been previously deported".\n\nSo all were guilty of being here illegally and 93% were previously convicted of other crimes.\n\n\n\n
 Is it just me or do all these fuckers look like those weird kids we all went to school with that had horrible social skills and never had any friends because they were total douchenozzles and whenever they got in trouble their mommies blamed all their problems on everyone else. 
While I can't be certain who the author is I bet a professional statement analyst would have a field day tearing this receipt apart. I've read a little about it and for one, like you said, people full of hate aren't going to put that hate on pause long enough to engage in pleasantries at the beginning of their hate rant. \n\n Example of how silly this is: To my black neighbors, I really enjoy looking at your nicely manicured lawn and flower beds however I can't fully enjoy it while outside because of your son's "negro" music blaring in your garage. "White Power". \n\nThen of course you have the biggest damn giveaway which is the  quotations. They are used to signal a quoted statement. In other words, it indicates a statement coming from someone else. These wouldn't be needed if the author of the note was naturally writing the letter from their own perspective. Instead it's clear the author is writing the note from an **imagined** perspective. This is what they think a hate note writer would say. A real hate note would be something more like: no tip for you wetback go back to Mexico.\n\nThen you have questions like how would a diner know the owner of an Italian restaurant was Mexican? If they did have such horrible views about Mexican owned businesses wouldn't they check before they went out to eat in a town with a fuck ton of immigrants? \n\nLastly there are already people calling the owner out on Facebook. Some are claiming to know of employees who are saying online and in a radio interview that this is fake. Another claim is that a Latino couple recognized this receipt as theirs and are saying it's fake. Add the fact that reviews have said they thought the restaurant wouldn't be in business much longer in that market and that they noted recent attempts at improvements. This could suggest they are looking for a gofundme windfall like in past cases like this. Again, I'm not saying the owner did it but I do not feel like the author is actually a person racist against Mexicans.

But I don't have a problem with transgender people using the bathroom of their choice. Geez you guys make a lot of false assumptions.
They can't cave in. They need to make an example of her and protesters or else they will do this every time someone gets deported. 
Sure. Here is an extensive research paper on the subject: https://object.cato.org/sites/cato.org/files/pubs/pdf/pa746.pdf
Damm. That sucks. They really are terrible for sleep. The beds are uncomfortable, all the beeping noises and shitty fluorescents, the interruptions, either too hot or too cold....It's a depressing environment. 
I was getting that case confused with this [one](http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/15-year-old-refugee-who-9290287) which happened in the UK and was reported around the same time as the one in Austria. It is another rape of a 5 year old boy by a refugee. I never said the refugees were from the same place. I was answering your question regarding where the term sexual emergency originally came from. Don't know who added Ethiopean in front of it but it wasn't me. 
Hey there. How have you been? Speaking of gender related rights, what is your opinion on nude showering and sauna use with people who have different genitalia? In other words, if people who have female genitalia( women and post op transgender women) are only comfortable showering with others who also have female genitalia, should they have that right? 
Do you want sources for assaults in bathrooms period or are you referring to just those cases where men presented themselves as women to gain access to ladies rooms for nefarious purposes? Here are a few cases involving the latter: \n\nhttp://www.torontosun.com/2014/02/26/predator-who-claimed-to-be-transgender-declared-dangerous-offender\n\nhttp://www.ajc.com/news/local/cross-dressing-man-arrested-for-exposure-walmart/b0Ikm8U25R0oDFkN2LW66O/\n\nhttp://www.oregonlive.com/oregon-city/index.ssf/2011/10/cross-dressing_sex_predator_se.html\n\nhttp://www.nbcwashington.com/news/local/Man-Dressed-as-Woman-Arrested-for-Spying-Into-Mall-Bathroom-Stall-Police-Say-351232041.html\n\nhttp://www.nbclosangeles.com/news/local/Secret-Recording-Store-Mall-Antelope-Valley-Palmdale-Restroom-207541101.html\n

Of course it's relevant because anyone who lives there will be hesitant to openly discuss such issues as it could lead to arrest. Maybe that's why there aren't more recent cases because people are concerned about the gray zone. This is the inherent problem with hate speech laws. What many consider to be hate speech others don't so it will often reside in that gray zone and that's exactly why we don't have laws against it in the U.S. \n\nSometimes it better to let people openly speak their mind even when such speech is painful to hear. Allowing it means it can be examined and criticized. Suppressing it allows growing resentment to remain unchecked and challenged. 
They would use which ever bathroom matched their sex which is legally changeable in some states after a sex change operation. Like I said, cisgender men need to get comfortable with the idea of using the bathroom with males who identify as and present as women. Cisgender females need to get used to the idea of sharing a bathroom with females who identify and present as men.  People  need to understand that you can't assume someone's sex by how they look on the outside. 
I looked at the source OP linked. Inside the summarized article they list each case and include a link to Brietbart's original article written closer to the time the individual incident occurred. Within that linked article another link is provided to which ever non affiliated source, usually major news outlets such as ABC, that first reported the case. So unless all those other major outlets are writing fake news articles about the crime then it doesn't appear this particular article is based on fake news.
Here is a good example: Michael Hess, a local politician from Sweden Democrat Party, encouraged Swedish journalists to get acquainted with Islam’s view of women, in connection with the many rapes that took place in Cairo’s Tahrir Square during the “Arab Spring”. Hess wrote, “When will you journalists realize that it is deeply rooted in Islam’s culture to rape and brutalize women who refuse to comply with Islamic teachings. There is a strong connection between rapes in Sweden and the number of immigrants from MENA-countries [Middle East and North Africa].”\nThis remark led to Michael Hess being charged with “denigration of ethnic groups” [hets mot folkgrupp], a crime in Sweden. In May last year, he was handed a suspended jail sentence and a fine — the suspension was due to the fact that he had no prior convictions. The verdict has been appealed to a higher court.
No, of course not. No law will stop a determined person. It's illegal to assault anyone but that doesn't stop people from assaulting others in or outside of a restroom. At best regulations the OP describes might make it more difficult for those who wish to exploit the situation to avoid detection. The gist of my comment was to point out that often people say those who are concerned about males in ladies rooms are scared of transgender people but technically they are scared of men who may pretend to be transgender specifically for criminal activity. 
Another article says she was only two weeks pregnant. Still trying to figure out how they would know if she was pregnant with twins other than a blood test which would detect higher levels of hormones than expected for a single baby. 
I'm not side stepping rather I seriously don't understand what point you are trying to make. In your comment you reference you are talking about "transgender males" committing crimes but I'm not sure if you are actually trying to talk about just males versus females. I ask because I have **not** been talking about transgender people. To be very specific I have been talking about cisgender males who are also sexual deviants using transgender bathroom laws as a tool to more easily gain access to female bathrooms. I didn't know if you actually meant "males" rather than "transgendered males". I hope that makes sense.
A [source](http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/native-americans-after-easy-money-in-pipeline-fight/article/2607821). I found other articles as well but I cannot attest to the validity of the claim or source however it wouldn't surprise me if it were true. It seems it's a universal trait for all of us humans to be dicks and manipulate others to get what we want. 
Who cares if a comment is inflammatory and offends someone. It's ok to be offended. Be offended and use the opportunity to argue your case. Banning speech is a very slippery slope. Take the court's reasoning. Because Hess didn't explicitly cite appropriate sources at the time of his comment they determined his comment must be an expression of disdain? What kind of Orwellian bullshit logic is that? Are publically stated opinions that may offend someone only allowed provided they are sourced? How many sources should one state? What if the source isn't approved?  
In Sweden one can be arrested for speaking about immigrant related crimes. They don't have free speech like we do here. Politicians and local police also do things like intentionally conceal the demographics of crime which is frustrating the citizens and some are starting to speak out publically even though it puts them at risk of getting arrested. The citizens want to talk about because they feel that's the first step to finding a solution. Concealing the issue is meant to prevent racism but the problem has grown too noticeable now so they feel the efforts to suppress their concerns are backfiring and actually stoking more racism than preventing it. \n\nEdit: I know this claim is so outrageous it seems unbelievable. I wish that were the case. But to those who think I'm full of shit, it's already happened. I posted this elsewhere- "Michael Hess, a local politician from Sweden Democrat Party, encouraged Swedish journalists to get acquainted with Islam’s view of women, in connection with the many rapes that took place in Cairo’s Tahrir Square during the “Arab Spring”. Hess wrote, “When will you journalists realize that it is deeply rooted in Islam’s culture to rape and brutalize women who refuse to comply with Islamic teachings.

I've visited the Canadian war graves in Normandy, rest assured, you are not forgotten!
Her kids are teens that were born here. They aren't living in a detention facility. But if they were being held in one, I think that it would be a total waste of taxpayers money as it's much cheaper just to send them back to their country of origin. How do you know if they have a car? If they don't have a car their dad can send them on a nice comfy bus to visit their mom in sunny Mexico. I have a fuck ton of compassion. Specifically I have compassion for her kids because she really fucked them with her bad choices. 
Again, bear in mind in my opinion no extra law for or against should be made. \n\nSo about the first man I wouldn't insist he or any of them do anything if they used the restroom that didn't match their sex. For one, I wouldn't know what their sex was for sure unless they told me. And if they didn't commit any crime in said restroom then I wouldn't have any reason to ask their sex either. No law needed and it works out ok. Again, no law for or against so everything is handled on a case by case basis.  I wouldn't just assume their sex. \n\nSame thing goes Mr. Stinson. I probably would be startled initially if I walked in and he he was standing there and I had no idea who he was but like I said before it's not my place to assume his sex nor ask for proof. But Mr. Stinson is post-op so he's male and would have no reason to use a female locker room.\n\nUnless they just committed a crime, lewd or suspicious behavior then no I wouldn't ask for any documentation.\n\nAs far as the transgender women are concerned, same thing goes. There would be absolutely no reason for me assume their sex nor would I ask for proof. They could use the women's room just fine. And as far as safety is concerned, if a criminal really wants to assault a woman or a transwoman then no locker room door or law will stop him. He can assault that transwoman in the men's locker room or the women's. \n
Nothing I said is made up but believe what you want. I understand it can often be difficult for many, I'm guilty myself, to judge another's tone and intent when all we have to go on is someone's typed words. Sometimes it's much easier to get a read on someone when conversing in person. Consider it is a combination of such factors including the sensitive nature of this topic that caused you jump to inaccurate conclusions. It's a shame though as I always feel when situations like this occur that opportunities such as improved communication were lost even if we had ultimately disagreed. If you can't set aside your emotions in this conversation, I encourage you to try in future conversations with others:)
I think it could be in part because its more common for males to be voyeurs. This holds true in self reports and convictions for voyeurism related crimes. 
Not OP but I think it depends on the circumstances. If a rape involves violence and/ or kidnapping then yes, it should be a life sentence. If a rape involves two drunk people, one who was impaired to the point they didn't understand the other party wasn't able to consent then no it shouldn't be a life sentence. In this case the man had kidnapped and raped a person before. I do not believe a person that violent and depraved can ever be rehabilitated to the point they can be trusted in society.  
This is the reality based on the 2005 UN Human Development Report:\n\n[Link](http://www.hawaii.edu/powerkills/WAR.DEAD.16TO20C.JPG)\n\nSo technically he is right about the 20th century being the most deadly if one looks at the data. Here are some articles on the subject: \n\nhttp://www.newsweek.com/deadliest-century-done-163268\nhttps://www.theguardian.com/education/2002/feb/23/artsandhumanities.highereducation\n\nAs far as  his views on the importance of Christianity, that is just one aspect of his world views he talked about during that conversation and I think it's important to recognize who his audience was, a bunch of Christians. He also talked about crony capitalism, libertarianism, Islamic fascism, spoke negatively about Putin, etc....Personally I did not get the impression he is a wannabe Christian warrior and I don't even like religion. I'm an atheist. No offense but I think people sort of have this chicken little mentality when it comes to Bannon. \n
Note that when I posted this comment there were about 10 comments and most were up in arms over what could be a hate hoax. The majority of commenters at the time automatically assumed it is legit rather than those choosing to wait for more info. Note that I did not say how long for people to automatically assume something is definitely fake rather I wondered how long before people will consider it could possibly be fake. I find an automatic assumption that it's true or false equally perplexing. 
My mom can't dance for shit but she loves to dance and doesn't give a fuck who's watching. Every damn time we go somewhere like a wedding no one will dance until she gets up and starts doing her thing. She's like a magnet drawing dancers to the floor. I guess they figure if she's willing to risk embarrassment and actually have fun then they can do it too. She is the life of every party I've been too but always the worst dancer lol. 
Really? So when your kid comes home crying and depressed and seems suicidal because three gang members threatened to kick his ass, another kid stole his competed homework, a week later a teen slashes another kid's neck with a razor blade and there is virtually no instruction time because of challenged kids interrupting the entire class, you'd be happy to continue to send him to such a school? Because this is reality in my poor inner city schools.
Hello. Yes it is true that people tend to comment on the same types of threads as most of us generally have a subset of topics we are more interested in than other topics. 
I totally agree actually. When my newly pregnant friends used to come home from the OBGYN and tell me the doctor or nurse said they had unusually high HCG levels, which in some cases could mean they are having twins, I'd always cringe knowing it's not always accurate but that wasn't going to stop stop them from blasting it all over Facebook like its fact. 
Damn. And I thought my tits were YUGE!
What's so messed up is most of the wealthy people who want to eliminate school choice, charter, vouchers and home school all send their kids to private school. 
I believe it's possible for them to be rehabilitated but the rehabilitation rates aren't good enough to take the risk. Some may feel my opinion is a bit calloused and maybe it is but they sentenced their victim to a lifetime of mental trauma and that is a much worse sentence than a lifetime of being clothed, fed and housed in a jail. \n\n For other types of violent crimes I do not feel this way. For example, say someone without a any history of violence attempts to rob what they think is an empty house for money to buy heroin, but the homeowner is there, attempts to stop them and gets assaulted in the process. I believe if that person can become clean then they will not necessarily have any motivation to assault random homeowners again. They can be rehabilitated. Sexual violence is much more complicated. It's not just about sex, it's about power. 
A little boy was raped in a public pool in the U.K. by a migrant who said he had to rape him because he was having a sexual emergency. Some of these migrants and refugees came from very barbaric cultures.
They know once it reaches the Supreme Court and they lose, it will be more ammunition to split up the 9th. It's an ass saving ploy.
Yeah. She wore a hard brace for two years but her curve was growing too aggressively so they had to fuse her spine at a somewhat early age.  
Tell that to arrested and fined Swedish politician Michael Hess.
How often do you eat and what types of food are you eating?
This woman advocates violence. She has possibly made herself a target for other groups who oppose her and who also advocate violence. Even if I agreed with her, I wouldn't want my young child to be in a classroom with someone who has made herself a target as it puts my child in danger.
But I didn't provide a source. I only discussed the source OP provided because you refuse to read it. You said you would read other links. I said other links are provided within OP's source but it appears you  will not even use OP's source as an access point to other sources. 
That doesn't change the fact he was arrested which is exactly what I said: "In Sweden one can be arrested for speaking about immigrant related crimes". Even if one can appeal a charge in a court of law it is disconcerting that one would even have to plead their innocence for speaking openly about such things.
Pool needs to go undercover without the mayor in tow. There is no way he'll get an accurate portrayal of the situation while being escorted. 
Lol u mad? 
I was just thinking that I've heard women express very similar points. Women that  have also been bullied, mutilated, and raped by males just because they are female. And they apply the same logic you use when you feel uncomfortable about using a bathroom with men. It's not that women are afraid of transgender women, they are afraid of men posing as transgendered women. They don't want to use a bathroom with men for many of the same reasons you listed as to why you don't want to use a bathroom with men. Women have also had issues with mental health and suicide because of abuse by men. For these women, they have a fear that allowing men into restrooms will increase their risk of danger. Again, they are afraid of men taking advantage of the situation. Do you ever feel sympathy for women who have been abused by men and are truly afraid of the potential abuse of transgender bathroom policies? 
So I have read the transcript many times but thanks for sharing it again. But note you agree that people evaluate whether or not to kiss someone without permission on a case by case basis. But at the same time you go on to make a lot of assumptions about every case in which Trump has kissed someone, without knowing the details of the situations by using some off the cuff comment that sounds like it was at least made partially in jest. I mean if he was just walking around grabbing every pretty woman's pussy I'm sure he'd have lawsuits popping up long before the election. Considering the start of this conversation was about him admitting he backed off of a married women who wasn't into him, I'd say it stands to reason he has no interest in forcing himself upon unwilling women. At best it seems like sometimes he may get the wrong impression. \n\nConsidering it was a casual conversation between two men one could assume he didn't bother to clarify himself and that he assumed this particular listener would understand some things unsaid are just a given and others things said are in jest. In some people's view he meant:  \n\nTrump: "You know I'm automatically attracted to beautiful... I just start kissing them(when I can tell they're into me). It's like a magnet. Just kiss. I don't even wait ( when I think they might be into it). And when you're a star they let you do it. You can do anything( when you're rich and powerful and surrounded by women who are into men like that). \n\nBush: "Whatever you want."\n\nTrump: "Grab them by the pussy. You can do anything." (said in jest)\n\nOthers assume he meant:\n\nTrump:  "Yeah that's her with the gold. I better use some Tic Tacs just in case I start kissing her. You know I'm automatically attracted to beautiful... I just start kissing them( even if I know they don't want me to). It's like a magnet. Just kiss. I don't even wait( because I'm going to have my way with them regardless of how they feel.) And when you're a star they let you do it. You can do anything( when women are terrified of your money and power)."\n\nBush: "Whatever you want."\n\nTrump: "Grab them by the pussy. You can do anything."(said literally)\n\nPeople who don't like Trump will assume he meant everything literally and people who do like him don't take him literally. But not one of us know for sure.
I'm not a Christian, I'm an atheist. And I don't care if transgender people shit beside me. Notice I didn't once claim that men would abuse transgender bathroom polices. Instead I said some women are afraid they will. Fear is often unreasonable is it not? 
I did. It worked for 6 yrs but then the district shifted school boundaries within the county to spread out the demographic groups a little more and cracked down on high performing kids trying to attend this one school. In other words, they moved a portion of the kids in the violent impovrished neighborhoods into other districts. They brought the violence with them. This time, we are moving 3 hours away. But we can just now afford it. Many parents in the same position can't move so they do charter or homeschool. Currently my kids attend a homeschool charter.
Jesus Christ dude, it's already happened. Stick your head in the sand all you want to but it isn't going to change the facts.  This fact can be discovered as it is readily availed for anyone who has an Internet connection and can read across a multitude of internet sources. 
To be fair even if one hates him, he is talking about addressing a very real and deadly conflict that another group has already started in the name of their religion. Another portion of his statement:\n\n "Now that call converges with something we have to face, and it’s a very unpleasant topic, but we are in an outright war against jihadist Islamic fascism. And this war is, I think, metastasizing far quicker than governments can handle it.\n\n"If you look at what’s happening in ISIS, which is the Islamic State of Syria and the Levant, that is now currently forming the caliphate that is having a military drive on Baghdad, if you look at the sophistication of which they’ve taken the tools of capitalism. If you look at what they’ve done with Twitter and Facebook and modern ways to fundraise, and to use crowdsourcing to fund, besides all the access to weapons, over the last couple days they have had a radical program of taking kids and trying to turn them into bombers. They have driven 50,000 Christians out of a town near the Kurdish border. We have video that we’re putting up later today on Breitbart where they’ve took 50 hostages and thrown them off a cliff in Iraq.\n\nThat war is expanding and it’s metastasizing to sub-Saharan Africa. We have Boko Haram and other groups that will eventually partner with ISIS in this global war, and it is, unfortunately, something that we’re going to have to face, and we’re going to have to face very quickly."
So are you implying that in your original comment when you reference "holy wars" you are talking about the Inquisition and not the Crusades? I ask because I think most people don't think about the Spanish Inquisition as a war even though it resulted in violence. I'm pretty sure the OP was referencing these [Crusades](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/1o3wwq/who_started_the_crusades_each_one/ccopqav/).
can we get a Dear Black People or Dear Muslims satire show on Netlifx? If we can then I won't delete my account. Whites are barely the majority anymore, you can only play the blame game for so much longer. If people thought white flight was bad in the 60's just wait until the next few decades sees all the white money expatriate or secede and form a new republic.
can someone explain why this thread is in full support of not allowing illegal immigrants, yet if this was in any subreddit aside from The Donald it would be down voted if it related to Americans wanting to keep out illegals. Considering Canada is ultra liberal it is confusing to me.
you too. also you can check how many are coming in each year (or atleast how many have been coming since 2004ish).\n\nhttp://imgur.com/a/grNKd
I still don't understand why the Bowling Green thing is a big deal. Everyone knows what she was trying to say. Conway does dozens of interviews a week and messed up a word. There was a terrorist plot by Iraqi refugees in Bowling Green, so yeah it was a massacre in the making. Fuck off MSM.
we have 30 years left of Barry. Fucking hell.
damn. what the fuck is going on. how doesn't this spark national outrage. The west is so utterly cucked
by who the few outspoken SJW that spam Trump after every Tweet he sends out? The outspoken minority is the ongoing death of this country. The silent majority gets their message through voting, which is fine for now but not enough to save western culture. Sad thing is that white people are nice until its too late, then shit like world wars or holocausts happen. We need to find a balance of being able to say 'yeah we are white and we don't mind a little diversity, but enough is enough.'
The Executive Order does not ban Muslims. I think the media wants the public to think it does. There are no Christians in any of those countries he banned?
you a German national or an American that emigrated/is working in Germany? 
I have read and watched almost everything there is about Churchill. One of the most interesting people from history. Put his bust back in the oval.
How safe would our country be if we stopped illegal immigration from our souther border and banned terrorist states. And no liberals that is not racist, no mention of race. \n\nWhat the fuck is going on with MODS? every reply to this comment are CTR and EnoughTrumpSpam trolls. This subreddit is probably bought by Clinton now. Fucking joke\n
Deport Extra Large Burrito w/ Guac.
What, because he doesn't go around with... a haircut and an iPod and... piercings and a... strap-on?"
the next decade is going to be tough for Europe. Hate to say it but there will be an all out genocide for Muslims in that region if we do not stop the flow now. A few more 9/11s in Europe will cause the greatest civil unrest we will see in our lifetime. I don't want it to come to that but liberals want to keep the migrant flood gates open. Anyone with a brain will understand once Muslims hit 10% in a given area, it becomes a -stan in the making. RIP Dearbonistan, Swedistan, Paristan, Germistan. See Lebanon for a little preview of what happens when Muslims flood in.
You guys should have federalized a decade ago. The logistics of and resources of western and Northern Europe sharing an army would give Putin nightmares.
beautiful girl. Too bad a single incident like this isn't enough to wake up Germistan. Her parents probably apologized to the rapefugee.
lol no way he ever lives in Illinois again.
lol, you're cute.
is the guy from stranger things cucked? was a good show but I protest any Hollywood stooge that gets partisan. Your job is to dance and entertain me, dance monkey dance and shut the fuck up.
A lot of good answers. One fact that seems to be missing is the logistics of where the strongholds are. ISIS and others do not just sit in a camp in the middle of nowhere in the desert. They are smart enough to realize that the US won't go bombing recklessly heavily populated areas. (Yes, we have killed civilians even though it has not been admitted). Mosul was taken by ISIS and the only way to flush them out is one by one on the ground unless you want to carpet bomb the whole city and deal with the backlash of killing thousands of innocents. This approach would just breed more hate to us and we end up back at square one with a new leader emerging and starting another Islamic group and naming it something different. We will go through dozens of Islamic groups like ISIS in our lifetime. In ten years it could cycle back to Al Qaeda or the Taliban. Most likely, a current student of Al-Baghdadi will break off on his own and create an even more radical group in the foothills of Iraq.
yeah, let's use a few lines of a poem from a few centuries ago to dictate our current immigration/national security policy. Get fucked
Deport
Yeah, that must be why I think I see hijabs everywhere I go around DC.
This is Sioux Falls in the making, I am trying to not let it happen. One of the reasons I do not want children is I don't want them growing up in Muslim America
then why allow illegals to come here and add to the fire? Now we have to use a portion of our federal income tax to house and feed this shitbag for four decades. 
Pretty sure in 20 years the entirety of California's elected representatives to the Governor down to mayors will be Hispanic. California's identity is gone. 
I'm not. I am sure there are some extremists here, but as we saw today every religion has theirs.
ISIS is a fucking joke. The future is Iran, China, and Russia via cyberwarfare. Bombing the shit out of shepherds in the middle of nowhere is a waste of time and money. 
where will they be settled? Anywhere near the 9th district judge's gated communities? Nope, just let em come in and breed another 7 Mohammads in the mid west somewhere.
Yes that was my point. Canadians will be subsidizing illegal immigrants health. Canadians will have to pay more in tax and will become angry because of it. Which in turn will lead to the election of an anti-immigration candidate becoming the PM, if this becomes a serious trend. Almost every country in Europe is voting for anti-immigration, or at least a candidate that opposes open border to migrants because they are subsidizing mass amounts of people that have come solely for economic reasons. Your comment did not make any sense, since it is what I stated clearly in my first point.
I am assuming he was a translator, since they said he helped alongside the Marines before he fled to the U.S. The only time I have teared up in my adult life is thinking of all the translators we went through and fucked over. There was one bad apple among the dozen or so through my two tours, but there needs to be some type of documentary-maybe Netflix that deals with how we left those people to die.\n\nP.S. since this is getting a little traction. These men LOVED the USA. Talked daily about moving to America and buying a big suburban house. A few of them were fascinated with Cowboys and wanted to live on a ranch. I am originally from Montana so I would tell them stories. Good to know that there are media outlets that have covered the promises we gave them even though they were mostly empty promises. I could never watch a documentary that actually dived deep into the issue, but I want others to know what these men risked for soldiers from a different country who were occupying their homeland. They signed up for the money but stayed for the dream of making it to the U.S.\n
Refugees? Why aren't Gulf States taking any? UAE only recently was pressured into accepting 15k spread throughout 5 years.
What do you mean? Republicans have around 240, Dems around 190?
it's almost like at least half of white people don't find white genocide, which is code word for diversity, to be openly mocked. It was fine when it was just the east coast cities being cucked but now the whole country is being forced to swallow it. Sioux Falls, all of Iowa, Detro Metro, Boise ID, St. Paul MN were the places of choice \nto secretly resettle refugees. States have no rights anymore. Can't wait for the revolution sign me the fuck up.
Did you reapply for this cycle?
the next Little Baghdad should be in the 9th district. I want this judge to walk outside and only see Halal restaurants. He should die knowing he created another Dearbornistan. His daughter should be forced to wear the hijab.
Taiwan is an amazing place. EVA Air (Best airline I have ever taken, yes better than BA) from Boston is dirt cheap and I ended up going randomly for like $750 RT. AirBNB and get your own place for like $10-20 a night. Enjoy.
Swedens gov't probably apologized when they put it on saying they are so sorry they forgot to bring their own.
what's the policy on getting a full chub whenever I see our first lady. new territory for me
I see all of Reddit has been infested with political propaganda, even reached here. Atleast The Donald is supposed to be biased. 
Black people are the minority I least care about, after all they were brought here unwillingly (the majority of them). Hispanics, Arab Muslims (who are identified as white in the census) are also minorities as well. You also understand the only statistic that matters for future demographics are the racial makeup of newborn babies, correct? Because since 2012 whites have been outnumbered by minority breeding frenzies. I don't find it "cool" or "awesome". Whites will make up less than 10% WORLDWIDE in a few years. How is that diversity.\n\n\n\nhttp://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2016/06/23/its-official-minority-babies-are-the-majority-among-the-nations-infants-but-only-just/
then don't let any Jordanians in then, works for me. I was trying to throw Muslims a bone, and give them two secular countries in that shit hole region. Jordan is one of our allies that has decent human rights in comparison to MENA. Let's only take Lebanese Christians, I am game for that.
still bummed that Iran won't allow me to come vacation in their gorgeous country. 
95% of Muslims are filth. If you are a Muslim not from Lebanon or Jordan I won't even give you a chance anymore. You grew up in a culture so unlike the West that shit like this is just engrained into you and you can't understand why its immoral.
DNC is trying to get 100% of the Muslim vote, they will have a Muslim nominee most likely in 2024. Probably that Keith Ellison jihadist.
Can someone give me a ELI5 why this Imam voted from Trump. That's amazing.
this is disgusting, poor child.
why would I be happy about Hispanic and Muslim populations dominating? Anything but white dominating is good right? /s
This just got me rock hard.
redditor for four days and bashes trump supporters on other threads. sup CTR? How much you get paid an hour? Honestly curious though.
our first lady is hot as fuck. such a nice change of pace.
how many liberals would let this snowflake babysit their daughter? you're racist if you don't!
He predicted Trump would win in a landslide in early 2015. This dude is a fucking wizard and kind of creeps me out.
Safest country in world, great economy, good healthcare, almost entire population is ethnically linked. Not a bad deal being Japanese. Also, being xenophobic over there is the norm and you can speak about it rationally. Theresa May of the UK started talking about limiting immigration and a shit storm occurred this week. The US will have no culture soon; go to big cities and if you are white you are barely or not a majority yet every race openly hates you. I hate this country, well most of it. 
They won't see it unless they are subscribed. If I logout I never see a posting from here. 
I like privacy laws but social media is the key to vetting I think. They are starting to ask for passwords. They aren't US Citizens yet so scavenger through every like or message they have sent. ISIS recruiters use Facebook. Social media will be key and hopefully we can include it in the vetting going forward.
All of the Jordanians I have met in the US eat bacon and drink. Small sample size but they are a whole lot better than most MENA countries.
I want to go to Poland, marry a based Polish chick.
could you give some examples of what would change? Could these superintelligent AI machines create war? Genocide? Or we just have no idea what they will do?
Over the past three months Teddy 'Ballgame' Cruz has really started to win me over. Seems like a good dude and he is a great debater even when I disagree with something he says, he explains exactly why he feels that why. He's knowledgeable and a true conservative so I wish him luck in his future political career. Who knows maybe he will run in 2024.
yikes. what are the benefits of them then? So we don't have to work? I think these super AI's will be the last of our worries when 80% of the population is starving and there is a class civil war.
Muslims only vote for the Democrat nominee because they need more open immigration to start accumulating more and more Muslim votes. They use to vote 90%+ for Republicans since they align with the party on way more issues, but since Republicans have become the anti-Islamification party they ditched the party in the '04 election. 
fuck this guy. He should be loved by vets but after voting against us twice a lot are done with him for good. He doesn't give a shit about vets or America. He has ridden his POW story his entire career. 
Did you pass the written portion? When do we find out
awh we missing Pepe le Pew
I just read the entire article and my jaw dropped. It's beyond evil this lovely girl was a VOLUNTEER for migrants before she was raped and then murdered by a very own migrant. The last thing this poor girl saw was the face of a refugee that she spent her free time trying to help. If this was my daughter I would be doing 30 years in ADX Florence after I got done with this fuck.\n\nThis was the fathers response at his daughter's funeral, from article linked:\n'At her funeral in Brussels, Belgium, her father solicited donations for two charities, one for Muslims in Bangladesh, the other for local Muslim refugee illegals inside Germany.'\n\nHis daughter was raped and murdered by a Muslim refugee yet he collected donations at his daugher's funeral to ensure more refugees could come. You can't save Germans like that, just not possible. \n\nhttp://www.independentsentinel.com/top-eu-official-solicited-for-refugees-at-funeral-of-daughter-brutally-rapedmurdered-by-migrant/
was she charged though? Found by police? Here legally? Don't want her getting off scot free
If Le Pen doesn't win then France made their bed and they will lie in it. We will come clean it up with the UK and Australia in a decade. Old France was a key to this countries founding so we won't forget that.
I liked Carter post-presidency. He never went on speech tours for 300-500k a pop per speech like Obama will do and the Clinton's have done and continue to do. He went around building houses for poor. He bitched a lot but he's a good dude. 
It's the media (reddit for 20 somethings) fault. They want chaos, they want drama, and they NEED hate. Hate fuels ratings, debates, keeps media relevant. Americans HATE immigration and DESPISE illegal immigration. The media and reddit would have you believe you are a racist for wanting people who come to this country to not leach off of our tax dollars and not impose a national security risk. Also, this subreddit is COMPLETELY invisible unless you are subscribed to it. Reddit is a fucking pile of garbage of liberal turds. MAGA
there's about 4,000 (3% of SuFu pop.) Muslims of mostly Somali descent (look at St. Paul for how they are doing there). Once a Muslim enclave is established in this country it will only grow. Imams from Cleveland and Kansas City are urging Muslims to go to SuFu to outbreed whites and to have 50,000 Muslims by 2020. (This would be about a third of the city. Obviously that is not realistic, but the day they hit 10% I am out. Islam is all about dominance in numbers, they are obsessed with their culture and only care about their religion. The most common birth name last year was Mohammad, and this obviously is upsetting to most. SuFu is not nearly the worst case in the country but it is a conservative city and very conservative state. The Lutheran society here gets PAID per head for every refugee they resettle here, so they are asking the federal government for as many refugees as possible. Montana/Wyoming are my escape plan if shit goes south quick but I don't want to give up, especially since good jobs don't grow on trees anymore. \n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYNhZ5LIM-w\n\n\nEdit: You can also see how many were resettled in your city, from below. It is just for 2015, so you can expect to multiply that number by atleast 12 (2004-2016) for the minimum amount in your city. Most important thing is the breeding rates which will be 3-4 x the amount as a normal citizen. \n\nhttp://imgur.com/a/grNKd
lol isn't the entirety of Scotland like 99% white? Wonder why she moved out of London?
I will never trash the media for waiting for all the facts before calling it a Muslim attack again. When I first saw the headline I just thought it was another day in Islam terrorism. It goes both ways. Muslims and Christians have been killing eachother forever and always will be. Extremism has no specific religion.
your turn Canada. I genuinely want to see your country take the same amount of abuse of illegals in proportion to your country's population as we have had since the '70s. Curious to see if Canada will become more right like all of Europe has, or stay true to their ulta liberal policies. Since you have universal care, I think the former is the safer bet. Canadians would elect an anti-immigration candidate real quick when they start subsidizing illegals. Can't wait to call you racists for trying to control your borders. 
his last few have been sub par. I still love his comedy and thought Louie the tv show was one of the greatest comedic achievements but I think he has lot a step. Not expecting A+ work from these but hope to be pleasantly surprised.
Yup, all for money too. Disgusting traitors. There is one based Lutheran in MI pastor who has the vision to realize it could get out of control quick and has called for it to come to a stop. Hopefully it spreads to SuFu.\n\nhttps://creepingsharia.wordpress.com/2016/04/18/south-dakota-lutheran-social-services-populating-aberdeen-with-muslim-refugees/
get it together man
99% of responses to his Tweets are people telling him to kill himself or celebrities trying to be funny by insulting him. 
Yup, we'll see. People already heated over at r/canada. Give Canada half the amount of illegals we deal with in a year and your social utopia will become chaos. You only have all your social programs you love dear since you don't have to spend anything on defense or border protection since the big bad U.S. picks up the tab.
How do they try to explain this? "We are just respecting their culture!". At least Michelle and Hillary did not wear the hijab when visiting MENA countries. As cucked as they are I would be cringing in embarrassment if one of our women leaders succumbed to Islamic law when on a diplomatic visit.
First time I have ever donated online to something. I remember saving up for my first big item that I purchased on my own. Hope this kid is doing well. 
this raises my BP to dangerous levels. this shit has been going on for so long the future of this country is going to be so split. Gonna be like South Africa where whites are the minority yet blamed for everything.
Even as cucked as we are as a nation, this wouldn't have even made the news across the pond in Eurostan. Western culture is on its last leg. WWII vets should be immortal, they are Michael Jordan x Tom Brady x Babe Ruth to me.
take em all bro, show us your humanitarian side. Don't let Sweden outdo you!
Easily the best super bowl as a Patriots fan. That was surreal
I want to learn Hungarian or Polish. Problem is they are two of the hardest to learn. Midwest cities in the US have meatpacking facilities that have attracted refugees. I am out if shit hits the fan. Whites will need a few countries to expat to and rebuild.
lot of bad hombres down there. plus the fact you have to hold your nose in the shower to avoid drinking any of that tap water are enough reasons I will never go back.
Which award show was this from? There's an award show every other week. Hollywood is a joke, it's embarrassing how they have to give fake awards weekly. They don't realize that every time they shit on Trump it just makes Middle Americans hate their platform even more. They'll never learn.
Tapper right in the pussy
you the man. 
Love Wilders. He's similar to Farage in that he has been singing the same political tune since the beginning of his political career (Nigel has been calling for UK Independence since he was 28 and Wilders has been trying to prevent Islam from taking over Dutch society for decades.) I'd vote for him if I was Dutch. 
The gov't would have broken even on student loans if they had kept the interest rates around 3%. 3% was a fair rate in my opinion, especially since federal gov't loans give you a lot of options such as deferment and forbearance, in which private loans you will not get. Once Obama doubled the interest rate quietly to 6.8%, it was purely to subsidize his massive healthcare costs. He needed more revenue and knew that he couldn't raise taxes or take medicare from the elderly. Also, most young cucks voted for Obama WHILE he was raping them in the ass doubling their interest rate. He knew college students was an easy target. Sickening. I bet that blonde girl in the pic complained about it while she marched her SJW ass down to vote for big ol' barry.\n\nI just hope student loans do not cause the next financial crash. Personally I am at 18k in student loan debt for an accounting degree so I am happy with my decision. I can pay those things off in 2 years and only give the government about 1.5k in interest. Lot of girls from my home town with 100k in psychology degrees that are at Starbucks being a barista or working as a receptionist for a dentist/lawyer/etc. It is sad when you hear that people are just paying the interest every month since they cannot afford anything else. The gov't will have to forgive billions in debt, and we pick that tab up. 
I want to be an ICE officer, I know they are trying to hire 10k new officers. Anyone have any insight to the process, are they mostly just taking people that have prior police officer experience/vets? \n
It's like Swaziland trying to invade China, it's a bloody political joke.
pretty ironic that it is mostly women who are screaming to allow the 35 year old "children" refugees in, whom at their first chance would rape them without hesitation. 
nah she lives in a mansion that is guarded by Dumbledore. She can tweet from her castle for all the peasants to live side by side with the 14th century scum. As a white women she would get devoured within 24 hours. As cucked as she is I really do not wish rape upon her, she would seriously be ripped apart by those barbarians.
I love Japs. I wish the only source of our immigrants were Asians. Hard working people. Some are annoying (Chinese) but they usually come over here highly educated at their country's expense and work hard. Indians as well. Well basically I am cool with any immigrant that doesn't praise a pedophile.
BS am in London, passed the scene during protests, not more than 5 minute delay in an uber -complete bs.
wait is that a golden seatbelt buckle? Awesome.
alright, I apologize for the personal jab. But where you are on the spectrum, there is a big wall to your left and the rest is waaay over to the right. but if you move closer to the middle of the room, you'll see that actually, the room is a split level loft and there's a libertarian coming down the stairs. Libertarians are not part of a left-right discussion, because these are framed in a government-type way. Libertarianism states Government is at the root of a lot of problems. Economically, this translates in non-interference, which is similar to 'right wing' and socially, this translates into live and let live, which on the surface is left-wing, but whereby typically my rights end where yours begin and the same goes for you. It's utopian, and a bitch to organize around with so many flavors in between still. \n
horrible how she tries to lure the audience into taking her point of view, 'would i necessarily agree if my 14-year old was having sex, no". This girl wasn't "having sex", she was raped. Throw his ass in jail and publicly shame his apologists!
KEK
oh and you'll find eventually that both far right and left have very similar thoughts on the role and size of government.
yup, just a sales tax and have most of it go to the states. Also: put amendment in constitution that total tax revenue should not exceed x% of GDP. Keep em on a short leash.

soon after and still unopposed, they won't need to be triggered by a speech anymore, they'll parade and assert their dominance. And then the public assaults and beatings start, and shopowners will be forced out. We all know where this leads to. Keep your eyes on Berkeley, that's likely where this grows into the next stage.

wow genuinely surprised how well they run -on stilettos! Nah, she'll be fine on those much sturdier heels. (we need a woman's opinion lol)
I'm beginning to believe the same about women chess players!
I ageee with you. I always felt a sales tax (as an only tax) to be a more democratic tax, with no need for a big tax code, which ultimately only benefits the rich, as well as giving us a system where everybody pays. If you make a modest income, by extension you'll consume less and pay less tax. If you buy a third sports car, bingo. Keep the percentage low by all means. Plus the hidden benefits of maintaining a MUCH smaller IRS.
don't forget Melania! I believe she told the God Emperor that the people were ready for him. And that's when he decided to run.\n\nThe stuff of legends, folks!
We should all pitch in and send the women in the First Family flowers or a card on Valentine's Day!

low T makes you compete differently on the marketplace for women. If you can't attract them naturally, as a man, you try other ways. Many of which start out by being the male girlfriend, hoping for scraps. This inevitably moves them into discussions about role of a man and they self enforce their own image and it spirals all the way down to 'I am a feminist' tshirt wearing cuckoldry. 
just saw it -that guy is a fucking brick wall, nothing gets through! I loved watching him. Man this team is amazing.
half good example. He could compete as a man, probably, but for unknown reasons (likely related to the type he's after) he opted for becoming a full-on Cuck (Cacuck?).

NY POST OPENING QUESTION
Amen brother!
you can't frame libertarians as far right, that's just plain incorrect. Both social and economic libertarians are diametrically opposed to those that favor strong roles for government in either.

none of this makes any sense. Fascist and Communist to put a label on them, make use of extensive government aparatuses and controlled or influences economies. Libertarianism is what rejects this -so they could never be seen through a lense of left-right. Within libertarianism there is support for laissez-faire economics, euthanasia, abortion, decriminalization of drugs -none of which square with either far right or far left.
this literally causes my brain to scream silently
just stay here and keep listening, that's what I'm doing :)
You share a proud heritage. Holland has a special place for Canadians, be proud of what he did and know you are always welcome there!
Amen!

The Dutch are eternally grateful to the Canadian people. You will always find a welcome there and a place to stay if you need. Your (grand) parents' deeds have not nor will be ever forgotten, and we will be indebted to you forever. I lived in both countries, and saw the gratitude and the repayment of Dutch farmers emigrating to Southern Ontario (mostly) up close.

Thanks, I was reaching for words, but contempt is what I was looking for. Utter contempt, on a number of levels. Working class people, white people. Framing living in a factory town and likely working for the same company as your parents, as being on par with hedge fund babies I think is the most insulting.
yep I agree, deserves more attention!
Folks, we don't need 4chan anons for that, it's been done before. Once they frame someone as an idiot in their narrative, the left can't also accuse him of some master plan. So they create a man behind the curtains. This is a 1:1 copy of what they did with President George W Bush, and they created Cheney the evil controller behind the scenes.\n\nIt's actually great -they follow a pattern in their thinking and acting. Which means we can prepare for it and more easily defeat it.\n\nFeminists teaming up with Islamists, that was something that kept me up at night.

Fuck those 3 chin hairs. 
You kind of made my point here. You went to the protests, so of course you know what you are protesting about. The point of protesting is to spread the message to other people. I, as an outside observer, have no clue what you're protesting anymore. Every sign just says something about how the person hates Trump, or how women have rights, etc. But what exactly are you protesting? Was there a new law passed that restricted your rights? Was your cause defunded? What can I do to help remedy it?\n\nI feel like these protests are reminiscent of the boy who cried wolf.

Two years ago I supported bringing in refugees. I watched main stream media, and like a dummy just took everything they said as truth, I didn't do the slightest bit of investigation. I thought only racists would be against these poor refugee women and children. Now I am completely against it, because they aren't "poor women and children" 95% of them are military aged men that steal, kill, rape, and destroy. I am FURIOUS with the media for running a propaganda campaign against the American people. I only started to see through the media's lies about a year ago when I first heard one of Trump's speeches.

But their opinions are THE RIGHT ONES, so you need to get it IN YOUR FACE.  It's their RIGHTS, bro.  ^^^/s
I see.  So technically you could be arrested for texting while driving.  But they can't inquire about immigration status until after the arrest.  The officer would have to arrest you, take you downtown, book you, just to get your immigration status.  That's a lot of work that the cops won't be doing.  Technically you could, but it's not going to happen.
#SCALIA WAS MURDERED
Police can't ask immigration status until after an arrest.  In most scenarios the offending vehicle would get pulled over for texting while driving, driver issued a citation, then drive away.  The only appropriate documentation they need is a drivers licence and proof of insurance.  \n\nI suppose if the cop wanted to, they could run the drivers license (which they will to check for warrants) but would that tell them the immigration status of the individual?  Perhaps if no SS# came up.  In that case I suppose they could be arrested for texting while driving (not arrested for being illegal), and it would be up to the judge to make a determination if the arrest was warranted.  Arrested for texting while driving is excessive, and the case would likely get thrown out by the judge, but at that point they are already reported to ICE, as the police were required to do after an arrest was made.  \n\nPerhaps they should move texting while driving to not be an arrestable offense.  But given that it is arrestable, I can see how this scenario *could* occur.
Muslims should be banned.  It's not racism.  Islam is cancer.  
Christians aren't going around raping, beheading, destroying ancient statues, burning people alive in cages.  Islam was written by a pedophile warlord, which I think we can agree is quite different than Jesus.  Comparing Christianity to Islam is just ignorant.  \n\nIslam is different.  It's not just a religion.  It's a violent political ideology that instructs those that adhere to it's teachings to overthrow secular governments, enslave the Kafir and kill those who do not convert to Islam.  This is what is written in the Quran, and reinforced in the Haddith.  Islam is spread through terror and violence.  \n\nIf you don't believe me, then go read through some history books.  Islam has been on a violent rampage for 1400 years, and it doesn't stop just because you want to get along with everyone in the world.  The real world isn't a liberal utopia of hand holding and rainbows.   Islam is a threat to progressive western culture and civilization.
Momma always told me never stop until you bust a nut.

The senator doesn't work under Trump though.  A more appropriate example would be a meeting where the owner talks poorly about a rival company or an employee at another company.  And that happens all the time. \n\nTrump also often will do things like this to assert his dominance and to force others to comply with his goals, and instill fear within dissidents.  People hear this and think "WOW He almost destroyed this senator guy for a single offhand comment.  I better fall into line." It's an effective power consolidation tactic.  
Right?  Are you me?  How many of us are there?!

Good tip!  I'm going to have to re-watch it with this mindset.
Fourth generation American and you identify with Mexico?  You're a goddamn American!  \n\n>Theodore Roosevelt’s ideas on Immigrants and being an AMERICAN in 1907.\n“In the first place, we should insist that if the immigrant who comes here in good faith becomes an American and assimilates himself to us, he shall be treated on an exact equality with everyone else, for it is an outrage to discriminate against any such man because of creed, or birthplace, or origin. But this is predicated upon the person’s becoming in every facet an American, and nothing but an American … There can be no divided allegiance here. Any man who says he is an American, but something else also, isn’t an American at all. We have room for but one flag, the American flag … We have room for but one language here, and that is the English language … and we have room for but one sole loyalty and that is a loyalty to the American people.”\n\nTheodore Roosevelt 1907
Oh noes!  Don't attack my user name!  
That's a pretty racist thing to say.  Why do you care about the fact he was white?

You don't like American jobs, a healthy economy, and border security?  \n\nPlease don't buy the media propaganda.  Trump will be the greatest of all time.  And he's proving it to us.  Give him a chance, don't just write him off.  Maybe he's an asshole, but if he improves the country that's a win, right?  
The gantry crane to lift him will be made with ....\n\n#AMERICAN STEEL
He was having a conversation with some folks.  It's not like he put "I'LL RUIN THIS GUY'S CAREER" on an official order or anything.  Just sitting in a room and trying to build a repport with the guys there to get some business done.  It's just joking around.  You ever been to a company meeting before?
You knowing some people doesn't change the statistics.  How can you ignore numbers like >90% disapprove of gays?  I don't see how you can just ignore that.  Besides, this is really just one section of what's wrong about Islam.  When you add it all together it's a witches brew of poison.  Why take the risk?  Countries don't have any advantages to importing these people.  Cheap labor?  Large voting bloc?  Way to sell out the country for a temporary gain.  The risks WAY out weigh the rewards.  All feelings aside, that's just basic logic.
That is true.  He's not playing around.  Perhaps he was serious.  I mean, he has some pretty serious stances on law and order.  I never liked civil forfeiture, too much of an incentive for the state to steal your stuff without due process.
Back to the name calling, eh?  Deep.  My mistranslation of the Quran?  That's rich.  It's a list of quotes!  \n\nAnd yes I will admit my responses are a bit lazy to you.  There are a lot better sources and videos of Islamic scholars I could show you, but they were difficult to find and I didn't have the time to dig around for hours to find specific videos I wanted to reference.  I guess I just need to start archiving all the evidence to prove it to people like you that ignore problems and then when someone points them out you just screech racism, xenophobia, or whatever other buzzword is hot that day. \n\nYou are right. Islam is not dangerous.  Jihad isn't real.  Muslims don't hate gays.  Women in Islam have rights.  Muslims don't want to install a worldwide Caliphate.  I was wrong all along.  \n\nI agree I think we are done here.  
Everything I said is true.

You guys really are blowing everything out of proportion.  That video is weak.  It's just joking around ffs.  Making a mountain our of a mole hill.
I want this oil painting hanging in my office.
I have nothing against Muslims as individuals.  But Islam itself is a violent ideology that instructs it's followers to overthrow secular governments, install Sharia law, oppress women, kill gays, and kill anyone who will not convert to Islam.  That's what is written in the Quran and reinforced in the Haddith.  Islam *IS* cancer!

DEUS VULT
*God Emperor Day
And I recognize that you had struggles against Christianity nut jobs.  So why would you support importing more people that hold those types of views?  You just won rights and then you want to import those that would take those privileges away.  It makes not sense at all.
I think you get my jist about the soup kitchens.  Let's not get too hung up on the details.  I also like how you tear into how Christians don't volunteer enough, while COMPLETELY ignoring all the parts about Islam, Caliphates, pedophilia, oppression of women and hate for gays.  Just ignore that?  Mhmm..\n\nIslam is still a threat.  You can claim that Christianity is bad and yadda yadda.  But even if Christianity is bad, that doesn't make Islam OK.  Islam has MAJOR problems, it's widespread and systemic.  The risk that is posed is too great.  There is no reason why you would want to import these people.  Like it or not, there are barbarians in this world.  Cultures that would seek to destroy the west.  Close the gates.\n\nedit:  Anyone care to refute?  Nope didn't think so.  Because you can't have a valid argument that says Islam is good.

Drop the identity politics bullshit.  It has nothing to do with her being a woman.  He didn't even know who the senator was.  You are part of the problem dividing this country.  The fact that you got a ton of upvotes just shows how blindly people believe this kind of bullshit.
Yeah, well it's not 1800 years ago now is it? \n\nI also disagree with your assertion that Christianity and Islam are the same.  Where in the bible does it state that it is your duty to overthrow a government and install a Christian Caliphate?  Because it's there in the Quran to install an Islamic Caliphate.  When did Jesus advocate looting, pillaging, raping, and pedophilia, and oppression of women?\n\nIf a person wants to become more like Jesus, what kind of actions would you expect that person to take?  Maybe work at a soup kitchen and do some charity donations?  Ask yourself the same about Muhammad.  Look up his life.  He was a warlord that conquered through fear and violence.  Islam is a real threat to the West, and ignoring it is irresponsible.  Why ignore such a threat?  Just so no one can call you racist, xenophobic, or other mean names?  
Where is the petition to urge Trump to send Soros in a rocket into the sun?
paging u/kanyeguisada\n\nThis is an excellent example of "virtue signalling."

Weak ass bitches play this card.  Men stand up for logic and principle despite the "PC" consequences.   
What kind of poem magic is this?  *Mezmorized*
Slow and steady wins the race.
There are 10 countries in the world where the punishment for being gay is death.  And they are all Muslim countries.  Women are covered from being seen.  Can't drive.  Can't go out in public without a male family member.  Can't vote.  Can't build a church there, or practice another religion.  If a woman is raped, she is stoned to death for infidelity.  Now what were you saying about those bad bad "Christian nations"?\n\nBut you are right we should let those who follow Islam into our country.  We don't need them, and we don't need their horribly dangerous and regressive culture.
American work ethic and striving for greatness built this country.  It wasn't "whiteness" or "privilege" that built this country.  Keep the welfare seeking leeches out.  America wants independent, freedom loving, hard working, independent people.  
So your position is that Muslims don't hate gays?  That you could go to a Muslim country and be openly gay?  [Have you even seen the statistics?](https://qph.ec.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-40b29ab2695a64a8d33df8a99c6d4851)\n\nSerious question for you.  Because I really can't understand this....Why do you think it's a good idea to import people that want you dead? 
The problem with Islam is it's not a "few bad apples" it's that the doctrine is poisonous.  Oppression of women.  Kill gays.  Overthrow governments.  Underage marriage.  Forced marriage.  Women stoned and beheaded for adultry.  Death for apostasy. Kill non-believers (Kafir).  Take slaves.\n\nThese are the practices AND LAWS of Islamic countries.   Sharia law for all is their goal.  The polls and statistics prove all of this.    \n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/TZR5I61.png\n\nhttps://qph.ec.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-40b29ab2695a64a8d33df8a99c6d4851\n\n\n\nI don't care about Christianity.  Islam is what is at question here.  Islam is a poison.  Keep it the fuck out of the country.  We don't need this kind of shit.  And I can't understand how ignorant you have to be to ignore all these facts and statistics, and examples and still say "yeah putting these people in our country is a good idea."  Just think about it. It's basic logic you keep barbaric people out of civilization.  We don't need them, and there is no reason to take the risk of importing them... Japan doesn't take any Muslims, China doesn't even have an immigration policy.  India?  Nope.  So why in the fuck does everyone expect that the US is to take all kinds of savages?  It's fucking stupid.  It's not our responsibility.  \n\nEspecially when you see the real world examples of France, Sweden, UK, Germany.  they imported them and get rapes through the roof. All on welfare.  Riots.  Sharia law.  No go zones.  It's real.  We don't live in a liberal utopia of hand holding and rainbows.  There are people that want to kill you and your family.  That's the real world. \n\nFinally here's a bit of information regarding jihad and the crusades.  Quite educational.  This shit has been going on for ages.  It's not any different today.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_To-cV94Bo 
Oh and what happened in France, Germany, Sweden????  Well [Sweden is now the rape capital of the West.](http://www.frontpagemag.com/sites/default/files/uploads/2013/01/picture769578.jpg)  [And it's all](due to migrants.)\n\n[Mudslimes carjacking, kidnapping woman, and shooting at concerned onlookers.](http://www.zerohedge.com/sites/default/files/images/user230519/imageroot/2016/07/26/SwedenAsylumNat_0.png)  \n\nWomen in Sweden are afraid to go out at night.  Police are afraid to arrest migrant for fear of being called racist.  Police told women that if they dont want to be rapoed to not go out at night.  [Come on!]  (http://www.allenbwest.com/ashleyedwardson/mainstream-media-wont-tell-you-why-sweden-is-now-rape-capital-of-the-west)\n\nFrance has thousands of cars burned monthly.  Riots.

Milo is awesome.  He's opening a lot of eyes and kicking off much needed dialogue.  His events are also allowing the ctrl-left to show it's true colors (through riots, crazy chants, etc.)  His service to the movement is invaluable.  That's why he was attacked.  Like they say in the video game world....if you aren't fighting enemies you are probably going the wrong way.  
Naw, they are just trying to scare/rile their base.
I'VE HEARD THOUSANDS OF STORIES ABOUT HOW CUCKED SWEDEN IS.  BUT I STILL HAVE A HARD TIME BELIEVING THIS IS REAL.  WHAT IS LYFE?
Well get used to it.  There's an alpha male in the WH.  The techniques he employs are what what allowed him to get to where he is today and build a multi-billion dollar trans-national corporation.  The guy sleeps only 4 hours, and works hard all day and night to make deals happen.  You should be excited to have a powerful president that is dedicated to using those skills to improve America.  
Trump must enforce his advisers with the same iron fist that the admins use to protect this sub.  No room for infiltrators.
I love how your response is just name calling. You fail to refute any of my points.  Go ahead try to defend Islam and how it's just a great ideology.  It's not.  It's a violent ideology.  I've seen enough Islamic scholars interpretations of Islam and read enough of the Quran to make a judgement.  And if that wasn't enough I've seen what happened to France, Germany, and Sweden when they actually tried the experiment and imported millions of barbaric people.  So it's not just theory and conjecture on my part; there are real world examples of the problems that mass importation of Muslims causes.  But go ahead call me more names if it makes you feel better, but it seems to me that you can't bring any actual arguments to the table. 
American work ethic and striving for greatness built this country. It wasn't "whiteness" or "privilege" that built this country. Keep the welfare seeking leeches out. America wants independent, freedom loving, hard working, independent people.
Your deflection is silly.  You have no real arguments.  "Hey have you heard of this court case in TX?  It proves that Islam is not a threat!"  Wow did you go off the rails there.  
You list countries in Africa that have anti-gay laws.  So you're saying that it's not Islam that makes them anti-gay, it's actually just barbaric and undeveloped cultures that want gays dead, and that it's not a function of religion.  That very well could be.  [The problem isn't isolated to Islam, but their opinions are pretty polarized >95% don't accept gays](https://qph.ec.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-40b29ab2695a64a8d33df8a99c6d4851)  Still goes to say that we don't need to be importing barbaric peoples into the civilized areas of this planet.  That's basic civilization 101 right there.

This sub is an angry liberal hellhole.  Upvotes are earned for having the most virtue signalling.  Political statements on every post.  Dissenting opinions are downvoted to hell.

The fact that this post got over 80 net upvotes and my post will be downvoted to hell proves exactly that.  \n\nYou can live in your liberal wonderland of cognitive dissonance.  But it won't save you from what's really happening in the world.  
Islam is not a religion.  It's a political ideology with religious tenets.  It's on par with Nazism.  I got no problems with individual Muslims.  I have a real big problem with Islam itself.\n\nAnd if you still want to say freedom of religion, fine.  They can stay over there and have their Islam.  Don't bring that shit here.  It's a regressive ideology that we don't need in a civilized society.  \n\nPlease try to defend the teachings of Islam as compatible with western civilization.  \n\nLook, acknowledging that Islam is a threat doesn't make you a racist or a bad person.  It means you are aware of the reality of the world. Let them call you names.  History has proven many times over that Islam is a violent and regressive ideology.  I mean shit, just go look up the Barbary slave trade.  We just broke up the Islamic Caliphate in 1924.  Siege of Vienna 1529 and again in 1683.  Battle of Tours.  I could go on.  History has the proof.
I prefer that Russia initiate it with a single massive MIRV nuclear strike on every major city in the Middle East.  I suppose you could use MOABs everywhere, but I don't think there are enough traditional bombs to accomplish total annihilation in a single strike.  
As long as there is accountability then I'm for it.  I just don't want a bunch of cult schools to pop up raising a generation of idiots.  We could end up in an even worse situation than just having bad public schools.\n\nI'm not sure how you have impartial testing requirements that don't have an agenda and actually measure academic acumen.

I'm a huge Trump supporter, and I'm against civil forfeiture.  I take Trump's offhand comment with a grain of salt in this case.  Looks like he did it to get a laugh out of the sheriffs at the meeting.  It is not necessarily his actual position on civil forfeiture.  Besides Trump has bigger fish to fry, civil forfeiture and some Texas senator isn't even on his radar, nor will Trump do anything regarding civil forfeiture laws, so who cares.

You hear that? Thats the sound of the MSM successfully brainwashing the left into thinking its a muslim ban

wow.
Haha take that Trump!!!
I mean, he is. I wouldnt go near that blob.
Oh boy, this is just gonna make the liberal tears much more salty when the SCOTUS inevitably overturns this.\n\nI predict more riots from the left.
Thats like enjoying some person whos life was ruined after being accused of rape
Generation Z is the generation that will be newly able to vote in the next election, so 14-17, basically highschoolers. They are leaning conservative because they are tired of teachers pushing their liberal narrative. Theyve grown up with access to the internet to factcheck. Plus Trump being the popular meme that he is also attracts a lot of young people, thus redpilling a generation.
Arent you liberals the ones fear mongering for trying to make this EO seem as bad as possible when in reality it is constitutional and Trump is doing it with the safety of the American people in mind?

You're telling me there is less rape AFTER muslim refugees have been pouring in? Lol. How could we trust the country of Sweden to report their rape statistic has gone up which would completely destroy their narrative 
If we're gonna take in these refugees, lets get an EO going that will forcibly quarter them to liberal households. They'll like that, right?
Terrorist attack in 3......2......1.....
Also, no way its to cover an indictment. Milo is way less relevant than Hillary getting indicted. And its too early

Liberals. Why oh why do you so desperately want and think all these middle eastern refugees are just oh so entitled to come to the USA. Are we the only country that can take them? Why cant we just get over political correctness for a moment and realize Trump literally wants to protect the American people, and you people are singlehandedly making this impossible for him. Youre literally wanting to see a president fucking fail for your own petty gain. 
Will you hire Milo?

You know, I always thought she was an evil Germany-hating troll.\n\nI'm starting to believe she's just fucking stupid.
Wedon has always been a cuck. He's basically the inventor of the waif-fu, 90 pound girl kicking men thrice her side with the power of moxie, and sucking the overgrown clitoris of feminism while getting dildoed in the ass. He got shit on after Age of Ultron because of ONE like Black Widow had, and he basically took it and asked for more while begging forgiveness.\n\nHe's a bottom-feeding cuck and a waste of oxygen.
I still think it should be "Le pen is mightier than le sword". But that's just me :D
FFS Hitler was a fucking Socialist!
The amazing thing is that they insist that any criticism of Islam (even if focused only on extremist/terrorist Islam) will lead to terrorism and radicalization, but constant rhetorical bombardment against Trump followers is just fine and dandy even when we're literally Hitlers.\n\nThey can't even stay consistent inside their own delusions.

Eh, abortion is a politically charged issue. I don't think funding it in other countries (by the US, or anyone for the matter) is a good idea. Every country should make their own damn minds about it and deal with it as they see fit.
And to think they lost their minds when the Prez referred to Hitlary as Mrs. Clinton.
LCK is a massive cuck. Much of his humor can be summed up as:\n\n"White people! Right?"\n\n\\*Applause\\*\n\n"I mean WHITE PEOPLE! AM I RIGHT?"\n\n\\*Roaring Applause\\*
"We're all going to die and the world will end if we don't reverse global warming!!"\n\n"OK, I'm sold. What do we need to do?"\n\n"Well, you should just send money to poor countries whenever you produce CO2. That'll fix 'em."
Japan is isolationist and very protective of their culture.\n\nThey're also fucking smart and quite pragmatic if needs be. There's a reason it was so fucking hard to invade them, they could be in the middle of a balkanized feudal war, yet any invader would immediately be cut to ribbons by a suddenly unified Japanese enemy.
>The speed with which the term became polarized and in fact a rhetorical weapon illustrates how efficient the **conservative media machine** has become\n\nAnd they still don't get it.\n\nIt's not conservatives, mate. It's non-cucks. It runs the gauntlet from hardcore conservatives to quasi-anarchists and everything in between who're tired of the fucking Washington swamp.

Feminists hate white men and the West. They want everything to burn to the ground, and consider rape by refugee an acceptable price to pay (specially those feminists who don't have to personally deal with the fallout, i.e., the coddled D.C. types living in gated communities with armed guards).\n\nDon't try to find any rationality in them, there is none to be found.
Ten feet higher!
> Gowdy said it clearly before that he is not siding with anyone but the law.\n\nThere's a reason why so many people wanted him as AG. Well, so many non-swamp people.
It's.... literally the _other_ side of the carpark. They don't have to walk an inch more to get there than to get to the White House. What the fuck.

There's the other thing. Lots of shit gets flung around in 4chan, but when someone comes up with something worthwhile, the rest of the shitposters take it and run with it with tremendous alacrity. You don't need everyone to be super-smart if theres enough people that can recognize a good idea from the super-smart and work it.

Starbucks is an excuse for vapid women to have dessert without seemingly doing so. They fucking coffees can easily hit 500-600 nutrient-void calories.
>Walid Jumblatt (...) said Le Pen had "insulted" the Lebanese and Syrian people.\n\nWell, you insulted her and Western liberties when demanding she cover her head against her wishes. So suck it up cupcake, welcome to the twenty-first century.
"Sweden changed the definition of rape!"\n\nYes they did. In **2005**. Stats of the spikes in rape and murder are from 2006-present.\n\nWho the hell is this Lemon dude? He's a fucking idiot.
My mom didn't wear heels, but she didn't chase me.\n\nLa Chancla has no heels.

Yeah. It's not just lower taxes, it's SIMPLER TAXES.\n\nAlways, always, always simplify the tax code. I don't understand why it's so hard for governments to understand this. It has to be simple.

I love how the leftie assholes think the US military would be on their side.
I thought their new slogan was "Allahu Akbar".
> WHAT THE FUCK WAS SHE THINKING\n\nThis is the same woman who had people dressed in Donald Duck costumes because "Donald Ducks his tax returns" (or whatever the fuck it was) and thought it was so witty and hilarious. She's the Pokemon Go to the polls. This is the woman who went on a radio station manned by African-Americans to claim she carried hot sauce in her purse, and when told that sounded like pandering, replied with "well, is it working?"\n\nShe's a failure as a human being. She's so out of touch, she makes 4chan autists look sane and well-adjusted. The only reason she's not been declared medically senile is because nobody can figure out what the touchstone for her reality is supposed to be like.
"You're not a comedian. You don't get to retreat into comedian mode."\n\nTucker fell for that one once. He ain't going to fall for it again, bud.
And I'd argue that using her position as a soapbox for her "healthy meals" thing - with corporate endorsements - wasn't a good thing. Because **she had no fucking clue what she was talking about**. Just look at the shitshow that is the school lunch program in the US.

> It's NOT okay.\n\nThese people are intellectual children. The whole "NOT okay!" (finger wagging optional) is the way one talks to a six year old. And they don't even do it in an ironic, self-superior way (as in, pretending those they speak to are so stupid as to need child-level lectures), it really is the entire depth of their intellectual arsenal.\n\nIt's just pathetic. For a laugh, go down to that level and simply as "why". Most of the time they don't even have an answer, all they have is something akin to "How can you ssay that? You even need to ask? OMG literally Hitler I can't even, and n".
Burning oil is a waste, it's a lot more useful in other forms such as polymers and fertilizers thanks to the petrochemical industry.\n\nThat said, we can't just drop it overnight. But I'd like to see a move to emphasize better uses of it and find **good** alternatives to burning petrol on vehicles.
Maybe they should learn from Charlie Hebdo about "publishing bullshit".\n\nJust saying.

This is nothing but a stunt for attention. She knew damn well she only had days in that position until the new AG is appointed, and decided to do some grandstanding and catch some headlines to fuel the hysteria machine.\n\nDon't do your job - get fired. That's how it's supposed to work in the real world.
Don't bring knives and guns. Bring cameras and livestream. Make sure shit's recorded in the crowd. Try to capture faces and distinct features.\n\nThe autists in the 'net will identify the terrorists for you.

Reddit is currently performing self-immolation. /r/all has been reduced to nothing but Trump bashing, which isn't particularly conducive for a site that claims to be the "front page of the internet".\n\nThere's a bajillion subs on reddit. I'd dare say most people don't come here for their daily five minutes of hate, they come to watch shitty Overwatch gifs, or cats with captions, or any of the other myriad of thngs that _used_ to get to the front pages. Now it's all wall to wall shit.\n\nI expect a lot of filtering, or for people to simply stop browsing /all. All these hysterics are just going to put people off because there's nothing behind it.

The issue with Monsanto is:\n\n- Pesticide/Herbicide "resistance". It's too dangerous as it has the potential of poisoning soils, water sources, etc. As is, the use of chemicals is limited by the impact it has on the crops themselves, and that's a good thing. We'd need stronger management rules if we're going to make extended use of chemical-resistant GM crops.\n\n- Intellectual property laws regarding GM. They're fucked. The fact that a GM crop can cross-pollinate with YOUR crop and you're on the hook for licensing money is all sorts of fucked up. Farmers should be able to use their own crops for seed without paying anyone. Monsanto can still turn a tidy profit - farmers do buy good seed anyway.

I hope you feel better/night gets better. Watch the red dinner. Seeing the President roast hillary on her turf is always uplifting. 
If you want to spice things up a bit, make sure to grab some actual spice (pepper)before grabbing the pussy. You'll thank me later😉
Came here to post this.👌
No idea why you are being downvoted because it's true,lol.  RIP Austin. Why couldn't have they gone to Dallas instead? 
This is how to shit post. Facts and triggering, lol. They were trying to distract us and keep us from red pilling the masses on Sweden. As always though, we have transformed their low energy into high energy. Meme War 2.0 \n\nNo brakes!
Welcome.\n
Damn. Stay vigilant and safe. Prayers for everyone in the area
Will literally be grabbing some pussy today. Trump gives the best advice, believe me.
You must have been telling him about those damn interdimensional vampires that are running the show.\n\n
Damn, I didn't know her back was so long. |
Subtlety is always best.👌
I never cared for the guy, but he just earned a new Dom.

This post is going down faster than  Hillarys presidential run.\n\nHell, it's  even going down faster than Hillary on 9/11 when she got tossed into her ambulance  like a SIDE OF BEEF!
It's  not a down thing at all to be sharing about someone that has made it through life like that. I pray that he makes it and keeps on fighting. Sometimes when i think about death I see it as a gift, a right,  for making it. Praying for you and your family.
I know it, you know it, everyone knows it- April is a Clinton shill and a huge cunt.
I think this is just a tactic to distract us from posting about Sweden. The manipulation is too blatant and obvious. With us spamming this pic of our Potus it is taking attention away from what they don't want us to talk about. 
Fingers crossed
Source for the video of her coming in hot?
This. Keep the fighting in house
I give not
Yeah, but aren't  the Swedish women the ones that helped get them in that situation in the first place, or is it another cuntry where their leaders are feminist?
Wtf. Good find ,pede. User name definitely checks out
He said the truth and called them out on the spot.\n
A *failing* billionaire, remember?
So in other words, interdimensional vampires?
Oh yeah? I'll  try to find it bit if you could hook me up with some sauce it would be appreciated.
Everyone wants to blame white men, but in all honesty it's  the white women that stir a bunch of shit up and then just walk away from any repercussions like, "my bad", then blame it on their counterparts. This is just an observation  from an outsider looking in.
They have audio?
Thank you for the post and for taking the time to lay it out.  Kek bless you

They should have made tje conference  NSFW. I just got called down to HR for streaming that live rape.
I'm guessing Soros owns dairy companies too..\n
I would prefer they grab their  ankles and bend over
Nah..at this point we should genuinely be working together. I am not into the idea of having to keep anyone in line except for myself. We are all adults.

Thank you pede, keep it going, lol. We are going to keep winning, BIGLY.👌 Post em if you got em.
He is a much better catcher, just ask mich(a)elle.
This is bullshit. Fuck it, Milo and other based speakers should hold their own conference right outside of CPAC
So hot.
They are taking care of their vets.
Let's meme flying cars into reality. We've all been waiting for that false song of hope for years now.
Warning shots? What a waste of perfectly good ammo. The police being there with full riot gear should be warning enough. 
Turn them into wind chimes 
But but, but CNN told me that illegals don't vote and that voter fraud is impossible?  Did they ask CNN for permission to even investigate this?
Wait, so this is talking about the daily press beatings,right?
Ooh i member, It was a sweltering 70 something degrees.
Of course he's racist, he's  FUCKING A WHITE MALE!
I've  been waiting for them since the looney toons day.

This! I've  been posting the same thing. Let's  not be distracted.
We really do have the best gays, believe me.
Roses are red\n\nBernie is a thief\n\nHillary got tossed in a van\n\nLike a SIDE OF BEEF
Muy bien, pede.
Tendies! Get your tendies here! 5 Pepes gets you a full plate of Tendies!
It's ok guys, women have rape fantasies so this is all ok. \n\nMakes you wonder if this claim from the media is always touted to normalize rape.
Now that's a meme! May kek bless your (meme)farm.
Does begging count as consent?  ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
How about some pigs blood super soakers
Someone call the doctor! I can only get so erect!
Hillary is back in the news?
You don't need me to find the rape cases. It's pretty easy with a search engine.\n\nI was remembering his position off the top of my head, nothing to do with my ability to comprehend English you degenerate. Have fun replying to nothing.
but it's SF5, nobody is proud of being the best in this game except America
I was starting to think the CPT had been left behind
> sanford should be hired by capcom\n\npeople said that about combofiend [ ](/atpRtsd)
There's a site called Fiverr where people offer all sorts of services\n\nHe paid some guys to hold up a sign saying "death to all jews" and then shout SUBSCRIBE TO KEEMSTAR\n\nThen they actually did it and he couldn't believe it\n\nThat's it, then the media lost their spaghetti and said he's racist\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJ8sMQh3nsY\n\n
SFV is dead (sales at a standstill) and it won't recover unless Capcom basically pull off a miracle. If MVCi is good, then SFV will quickly begin to fade out, it already has completely faded outside of the FGC. I can see MVCi headlining the Pro Tour starting in 2018.\n\nI think SFV will have some time on the tour for years to come but MVCi is going to get all the attention and the sales. Hopefully it's a not a mess like SFV because the FGC needs a good Capcom game again.\n\nI stopped playing SFV, now I'm hoping Infinite is good and waiting for Tekken's home release.
People still get mad at black metal bands performing? Whew, it must be 1994 again 
Feel free to hate on SF5, everyone else does 
my GF is Japanese and we have been together for almost two years, she gets more jealous than any western girl I've ever had, by a lot\n\nso the other guy is probably right, he's just dicking around because he's streaming and/or him and choco often have a ménage à trois\n
yeah more posts about punk incoming [ ](/ResidentSleeper)\n\nshit talk in a shit game is just shit
SF5 is so bad I just stopped playing fighting games, so now I'm like most of this subreddit🤗
yeah and I was wondering who the fuck is Lupe, never heard of him before SF5 and I do like some hip hop
wow SF5 tech [ ](/ResidentSleeper)
so much better than capcom USA being desperate to get in bed with Lupe
Gotta protect our cocks. GET ME A BRICK! 
don't lie nigga, matches all over with fight request
There are people in the Swedish police saying different, there's also plenty of reports of refugee violence and sexual assault. I agree more activity is to be expected.\n\nI'm not saying native Swedes don't commit violence or rape, but when it's refugees doing it, it's kind of worse. They're extremely fortunate to be taken in and given money & housing (which they are not entitled to), so to then turn around and commit crime is abhorrent. \n\nThere's a lot of uncultured types slipping in amongst the actual good people.
He doesn't need to work in journalism for anyone other than himself, the guy's name is out there, for good or bad. He ain't going anywhere.
already have a 6700k at 4.8 ghz but it's long overdue that AMD released something competitive, if it was 6 months ago i might have bought one myself.
Such a badass name
FGC_Poet won't reply to this comment LOL
RIP HEADPHONE USERS
> you can hate on SFV and play it at the same time\n\nBut first you must hate yourself\n\nso most of this sub has that covered
I should get a bird
Sweden is fine.\n\n~~Just ignore the refugee stomping on my face.~~
Looks like I'll be left behind soon
The USA is worse than the UK, the difference is you have Donald now but we still need to see how much he can uncuck everyone.
Why the hell would you use Japan as an example, it's not a country masquerading as an incredibly safe one, it just straight up is very safe here. Throughout history it has had a very low murder rate, it's not because cops just started fudging the numbers in recent times.
"where do you stand on weirdos peeing?"\n\n\noh god, left on suicide watch cus it was Maher who said it
Watching SF5 😒
Yellowface lmao\n\nJapanese people are white
The girl on the right looks like she could snap my dick between her legs\n\nHow much?
USF4 looks so much faster than SF5
> Also it's interesting to note that USF4 at release on ps4 was the same frames as SFV at release but it got reduced down to ps3 levels too (there was a lot of controversy at the time as capcom wanted ps4 to be tourney console even at evo)\n\nThe PS4 version at launch was a disaster of the highest level
Just because the US has problems doesn't mean Sweden isn't experiencing some bad shit right now. Unless you're one of the idiots (like the mods of /r/worldnews) denying there are some bad refugee 'gangs' popping up around Sweden as well as sexual assaults.\n\nDo feel free to do what you need to get your beloved karma though. Funny that 'progressive' types are happy to ignore rape when it suits them, yet if a sports star receives questionable or little consent from a lady, they never shut up about it.\n\nI already learned to just turn off inbox replies before some of the rape deniers get up in my grill.
> I've got news for you, people shat on IV constantly when it was the main game\n\nI've got news for you, people didn't shit on IV anywhere near as much as they shit on SFV (even during SFIV vanilla) . The community reaction to SFV is extremely negative, this was not the case with SFIV. Most people liked it, it was the vocal minority that didn't, where as with SFV, the majority hate on it.\n\nIt's not even close to the same extent, no.
yeah, dunno why OP would think anyone on kappa speaks arabic
at this point i don't care if they put barbie in the game
don't listen to him, he's russian
The PS3 versions of Marvel 3 and SF4 were trash, nobody should use them to state input lag because they were the versions people tried their best to avoid\n\nEvo using PS3 for a while was fucking retarded
You won't be saying that when you're the one left behind pal

http://www.thelocal.se/20170208/swedish-police-officer-causes-controversy-with-facebook-post\n\nIt's amazing that you're all so willing to ignore what is happening. \n\n
What a nazi
So you didn't read your own article? There is not a shred of proof that murder was covered up.\n\nPeople walk around very late at night without a care in the world here all the time, myself included. \n\nNice borderline racism btw. Furthermore, that article only mentions it happening in ONE city. Japan has a **lot** of cities.\n\nOh and why did you say 'fuck you'? Are you an unstable liberal that has to jump to insults?\n\nEdit: Oh wait it was 'Fuck. You'. The full stop really made it hit me hard.
Sweden is not made up.
Nintendo taking notes from ICE I see 
> just because he hasn't murdered them yet doesn't mean he won't.\n\nGood god some of you anti Trump people sound incredibly moronic, that's the sort of shit I'd expect to hear from InfoWars
He'd be a much better Black Bauer than the other guy, his acting and character are incredibly boring.
You just called me a white supremacist? First of all I live in Japan, so I'm a pretty self hating white supremacist to move to a country and city where I see hardly any white people whatsoever, you fucking moron. \n\nAs for low educated, I have my degree and I'm working in what I set out to do. Come up with a better argument next time instead of trying to label people as racists, skin colour doesn't matter, the actions one takes does. Maybe that's a hard thing for you to understand. \n\nIn your attempt to look like a champion for progressiveness you only made yourself look like an utter cunt.\n\nInbox replies off was made for people like you. Have fun projecting your own racism on people.\n
Regardless of this report, Sweden is getting fucked by refugees.\n\nYeah downvote this you disgusting PC fucks.
THIS BITCH IS CRAZY
Better to be fickle than a hater who will be left behind
I also got banned from /r/worldnews for linking a search engine to show "sweden refugee rape" and mentioning the police staff/chief/whatever's Facebook post.\n\nThese people are disgusting, even got called a white supremacist (the people here are 99% non-white) and compared to the guy who shot up the mosque in Canada, NASTY people!\n\nBTW I've actually called Saudi Arabia disgusting numerous times in /r/worldnews but one mention of this and I'm banned, lol.
It's because it's a bad game.
No way, only the offspring of Spicer will have the necessary spice
lmao Trump told him to be careful hahahaha

http://lmgtfy.com/?q=sweden+refugee+rape\n\nI'm not really sure how you are having a problem finding this stuff. All I do know is I'm not bothering to argue with any of you about it, cya.
The first title was "These niggas and spics can't MATH, what's the deal?"
Focusrite make different audio interfaces to connect your guitar/mics/other into a computer\n\nKind of like the Rocksmith cable but more versatile and of course better quality, if you didn't know you can use the Rocksmith cable with ASIO4all and play your guitar in other software (but IMO it doesn't sound great)
I didn't watch any of Winter Brawl, forgot it was on until this post 
The same people I'm talking about cry racism at the drop of a hat. \n\nHitler/Trump comparisons for example are offensive in my opinion, these have become popular in those circles. People shouldn't be throwing around the holocaust, I don't think they know the real horrors of it, or they're just stupid.

SF5 in a nutshell [ ](/Kappa)
I don't throw around the word cuck but Patrick Klepek is as beta as it gets. Closing his eyes during Yakuza 0 in case there was a nudy video? What a pussy.
That's a shame, I think I'll just play Rocksmith at times in the disconnected mode with the Scarlett & Scuffham
i think we should leave the haters of the joke behind instead, after all...haters will be left behind
I think the main character needs to die. He's an awful lead.
http://www.ibrod.tv/hbo.html
I'm sure you're right and the many news reports & even a police chief admitting it are wrong.\n\nIncoming downvotes from disgusting people that are covering up rape in favour of not offending.
It's pretty bad, but it works 33% of the time
So basically you just outed yourself as the people I am referencing. Genius.
If this was SFIV I might be hype but rivalries in SFV nah son\n\nAlso this nigga sent the most braindead SFIV hatemail I've ever seen
I hadn't looked at any reviews myself but seeing this lines up with what I am thinking. It is really bad, the woman from Homeland was a poor casting choice for me because it's not been long since she was a main character on that show in a similar role.\n\nThen there's the boring Bauer replacement.
They spend less time in Starbucks hunched over MacBooks
- They tied the loading times to the frame rate of the UI\n\nHOW FUCKING RETARDED IS THIS FUCKING TEAM?
I think this is the worst season of 24, I really don't like Eric Carter. The actor (or character) has no personality and feels like a huge step back from Jack Bauer. Perhaps the biggest problem is it feels like they're just going through the motions of what 24 has done in the past, the twists have never been more contrived.\n\nI liked 24 S1-5 the most, 6, 7, 8 and LAD were all perfectly fine to watch but even those later seasons are a hell of a lot better than Legacy.\n\n
Celica demanded it 
I'd be so hyped if this happened and the asians entered it, watching Poongko play SF5 is like removing someone's legs and telling them to jump
To be fair they did warn us the quality wouldn't be very good\n\nAnd by that I mean, they released SF5
Oh yeah nobody would ever lie on the Internet about their location or what's happening in their country. Never!\n\nYou people are nauseating, should have turned off inbox replies instantly after the first truthbomb.
Thanks for the effort :)
If I am you I would buy a different guitar to a Strat (or another brand with a Super Strat body) and I would upgrade the pickups in your old guitar and do some maintenance on it. \n\n
Yeah I'm sure this trend of people ditching SF5 is steam only \n\nFuck outta here
that's just how it is for some people, one of the first VR games I played was Onward and I've never felt sick or uncomfortable
at least i don't listen to ed sheeran 
Then if you think this boring recycled shit is a 10/10 I guess you'd be rating the older seasons 100/10. It's also not a reboot.\n\nYou might want to take that stick out of your ass.
Actually Thursday is the day they leave behind all the haters they've been writing down

Wow- did Trump put that back? Serious- I'm out of the loop in this.
You know Obama has to be reliving that press dinner where he attempted to humiliate Trump, who was at the event.  Paybacks a bitch..

This should be downvoted-how is this Trump worthy? 
Bastards!!!
Bleh what a bunch of losers.  Micheal moore (Jabba) is just begging to get invited to the party-any party.  
Trump would still kick the crap out of the left if he was that short...
This is so true.  I'm giving up thinking this can change.   There are 2 types of people on this planet.  Us and stupid fucking idiots that love sucking on the teets of their demonic overlords.   Sure , I could go on and articulate the differences but that's clear enough.
Tweedle dee and Tweedle dumb.   These two are a joke!
Wtf are they even talking about / "protesting".   A bunch of utter  nonsense.
2/3 have some talent (albeit worthless at this point). The other one - why is she still here.  Dunham is a talentless ass clown who's only claim to fame is to be a random ugly chubby girl who tries to be controversial.

The fact this picture exists tells you these two have some fun.

RIGHT!!  And the lying media would have been gushing over her bullshit.   And there would have been no woman's march.   The media needs dismantling and rebuilt.

I think Alex was right about the trans-dimensional-weird-as-hell alien creeps.  I mean look at this guy.   Who looks like this??
There's a new wave of sentiment that is rising and these idiots FINALLY are on the opposite side of it.   They will be relegated to their proper place of ignorance.  This PC culture that is being pushed by the mediasaurus and their nefarious puppet masters has to be shut down and Trump is the man to make itt happen.
Oh glorious leader we will love you no matter how corrupt you are.  -Clinton zombies
Yes. But why-just fizzled out? 
Whaaaaat!  These some crazy times
What the fuck....
Horrible woman.
Obama has created an echo chamber for this type of nonsense that has emboldened the extreme left and created this toxic society we are in.   Trump will do the opposite and hopefully this nonsense goes back from whence it came, Hell.   Whoa that got dramatic fast!
The guy on the left knows his shit:  the guy on the right will be his manager.   Unfortunate truth..
I hear her stampede from here.
That's a good one.  Sheeple 
This guy... I hear there's a new "the jeffersons" show coming our.  He could play Mr. Jefferson
Wow. That's just pure evil..  like we don't have enough crap to deal with..

Who gives a shit what this twit has to say.  Why is she even a thing.  I don't get it.  "Random ugly chubby girl said something controversial."  
Agree completely.  Those are immigrants I can get behind.
Ugh Martin sheen is such a bore 
I never liked Charlie Sheen.  Really dodged one there.  Thanks President Trump from all of us.

Now THIS guy is overrated

Nice cat.  The Donald can draw too.  What can't this man do?
Ha.  I've been telling everyone tomorrow's Trump day.  I get the "what are you talking about".   After that I sing my "hail oh glorious leader" song.   All good.
What are the odds.    Trumps 70 years, 7 months and 7 days old on first full day in office and his campaign managers birthday is inauguration day.  Wow.  This is getting  a bit crazy.
Hahahahahahahahahahahaha...
I've been off for 3 years.  It's awesome.  My wife-whose red pill is kicking in strong these days-deleted 80% of her "friends" due to the constant crying about Trump.   She's also stopped watching NBC news/morning and switch to fox.  She installed the Breitbart app about six months ago.  Winning Bigly!!
Just bought a big box for my kureg 
Smart looking lady their.  
I just watched this.   He setup the statement about President Trump and then cut Mili off due to out of time.  At least Milo got 2x Trump is fabulous in. Lol.   Milo is the gayest dude I've ever heard but he's still a solid pede. 
Blehk.  Shea's horrible in so many ways. 
This nut is definitely on some drugs.  
Most people are stupid and illiterate.  And by most I mean the exact number of voters who voted for shillary.
She is one messed up chubster.
Walking dead extra.  Wow Bill.  
I'm hitting the catalog up in the morning 👍🏻
Obama thinks he's still going to be king shit after leaving office.  Nobody is going to give a crap about this bozo once the title is stripped.   That's why ex-presidents fade into the background because they have no choice.  Everyone sees them as "the old guy in the club " after their term.
America is getting ready to jump the shark and I'm loving every second of it.   The limbs are going into nuclear meltdown mode with only 2 days to go.   The best part is   Trump could care less.     
Whew this boycott list is getting large.\n\n\nIf I have the list right\n\n- Starbucks - replaced with Black Rifle Coffee Target (is that one still going?)\n\n- Netflix - Can't do it man.\n\n- Nordstroms - Replaced with Amazon \n\n- Burlington - (meh never use) \n\n- All of the nonsense award shows (Finally I don't have to suffer through them as my wife is RedPilled)\n\n- NBC - Killed that one - and my wife is off it now too. Replaced with Fox (for now)\n\n- Amazon - Tell me this is not on the list - NYT, WAPO, ABC, CBS - all gone.  \n\n\n\nI feel like I'm missing some.
Looks pretty organized to me.. "you're wearing a mask over you face and black clothes too?  What a coincidence!"
