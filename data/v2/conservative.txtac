/news/time-warner-hulu-investment-1201829514/\n\n\nIf anything it probably proves that if Share TV is involved with NBC at all, they're probably just getting episode descriptions, cast lists, and episodes licensed from hulu that they can stream with ads.\n
It's less the difference between making a gun and commiting a rape and more the difference between committing a rape and filming your own porn. \n\nOne is perfectly legal to do depending on city and state ordinances (and the consent of all involved adults), and the other is a felony. Although you probably will have to do the bare minimum to ensure that underaged people aren't watching your disturbing smut.\n\nPorn is legal to make, and presumably easy to make. Guns are not as easy to make but can still be made with the parts lying around in a hardware store. See Slamfire shotguns and zip guns.\n\nYou might find yourself at personal risk when making a firearm, but it doesn't mean it's necessarily impossible to do (or even easy to track, if someone's just buying pipe and nails at a hardware store and already has the ammo)\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Improvised_firearm\n\nEveryone here agrees that rape and murder are bad, they just have a wildly different perspective then yours on whether or not making a gun should be legal, especially since many here are Americans and have a 2nd amendment that defines gun ownership as a right.\n\nI think the point is that trying to ban the manufacture of home made guns would be fruitless, because like banning homemade porn there's no way for the government to completely prevent people from doing it, just punish them afterward. \n\nWhile there are crimes where we do want to prevent people from doing bad things, that doesn't mean we always can at any sort of effectiveness. I think in some cases it might be just easier to remove some restrictions for civilians so that they can protect themselves but focus police efforts on the types of attacks and violence that they can prevent or stop much better. For example stopping would be child rapists, or holding patrols in areas where people would be at risk for attacks or burglary.\n\n\n
Eh, I think nintendo is amazing at multiplayer/COOP/party games but I think he's specifically asking about steam controllers.\n\nOtherwise I'd say Portal, the lego games, Rocket league are all sound choices for steam coop games. There might be some Sega games or something that support 2 player as well.
I think it could work if they do something simular to MCU, where there is influences from the comics but they can take liberties with the plot as it's a different universe. For instance the Chitauri were an Ultimate Marvel invention that were used by the MCU, and the Other is probably specific to the MCU.\n\n I think just making Hush a guy obsessed with making Wayne's life miserable could work in a movie plot. He's more of a Bruce Wayne villain then a Batman villain, and that could work to make the film interesting. Most of the villains have a war with the batman, and Elliot just wants to make Wayne's life miserable. You don't even really need Riddler to set up Hush because he's basically a dude obsessed with Cosmetic surgery and Identity theft.\n\nIn Arkham Knight, he's attacking Wayne Enterprises and has nothing to do with Scarecrow's war.\n\nI think it would be neat if Hush was used as a plot twist. Some Wayne centric scenes in a movie could be realized as "This isn't our Wayne", but only after Hush reveals himself.\n\n\n\n
Personally as someone who plays as a ranger or engineer in PVE most of the time, I like necro players because their small army of minions means I don't have to take as much damage to do damage.\n\nIf there's a particularly difficult boss or NPC I want something to keep from getting hit more often than not and stick to shooting arrows or reviving people.\n\nEdit: and I'm sure I've had my fair share of moments where I probably would be knocked out, if not for some necro showing up and reviving me while their minions distract the thing I was fighting.\n\n
Any particuler reason you're not just deploying Chrome?\n\nI think the idea of giving the users Vivaldi is cool, but I think from a management perspective Chrome will have GPOs and profile support for both Mac and Linux that will let you have better control over the browser as a whole. For instance preloading bookmarks, or configuring the browser to use a certain proxy.\n\nYou might be able to use the Chrome GPOs with vivaldi but in truth I have no idea.\n\nedit: I found a Vivaldi Forum thread you might be interested in.\n\nhttps://forum.vivaldi.net/topic/7520/vivaldi-gpo-policy-templates\n\nI imagine the original creator just modified existing Chrome Group Policy Objects with the vivaldi file paths and title.\n\n

All these riots are basically simplified down to "LOOK AT ME I'M IMPORTANT NOW"\n\nSome groups are apparently convinced that the only way to be noticed is to set things on fire or break things. Maybe occasionally keep a heart attack victim from reaching the hospital with a traffic jam.\n\nOf course it only convinces people that they're idiots who don't need to be listened to.\n\nThere's probably opportunist idiots and instigating idiots in that list, but the bottom line is that rioting makes them idiots.\n\nOnly times I've ever seen protests IRL, it was a union strike, and a protest against the governor.\n\nBoth had a complete lack of things set on fire.
Thank you Mr Skeltal for good unions and calcium and bones.
Killer Croc only seems bad because most people think of the Arkham games and we have guy with super dry skin vs Enchantress and her brother.\n\nI think people here want a scary man croc and not a guy who kinda reminds me of Tree man.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidermodysplasia_verruciformis\n\nCroc also didn't really even do anything of note outside of swim with a bomb. He could have at least bit some people, but no we don't even get that. Maybe tank some bullets or go wild out on some enchanted goons.\n\nI don't think Killer Croc was that horrible, but he wasn't as cool as Arkham Croc.
And my sides :O
I heard about guild wars through forums and whatever, but I never actually played GW2 until the core game went free to play. Then I bought heart of thornes while it was on sale.\n\nOverall I think having word of mouth works to Anet's advantage because even if players aren't instantly sold on the game just because they heard someone talking about it, they might be more inclined to try it out then if an ad popped in their face.\n\nI ignore most ads, but I might be more inclined to try something if I know of a group of people play it or are excited about it.\n\n
Yes\n\nThere's the Custom Elements API, which others have linked to, but there's also whole libraries for this purpose such as Polymer, skate.js or Microsoft's x-tag that would let you add pre made elements or share your own.\n\nYou can find out more at https://www.webcomponents.org/, which showcases both premade elements and some third party libraries that you can use to implement your custom elements in a way that will work on every browser.\n\nFor an example of web components being used in a production environment, Google's AMP project lets publishers build mobile websites with minimal data usage by only using certain html elements that google allows, and offering amp specific tags. https://www.ampproject.org/\n\nIIRC Reddit actually uses amp for some mobile pages. You can check it out at https://amp.reddit.com/r/OutOfTheLoop/comments/53ztlp/what_is_ampredditcom/\n\nI think it's mostly intended for accessing reddit from a search engine where you want to make the pageload not too big.\n\n\n\n\n\n
I don't think Trump personally cares about the whole gay issue. I think that's more Pence and maybe some other republicans.\n\nI figure he's probably just going to sit in the middle of both the right and the left and try to leave everyone alone no matter who they are. I don't see him trying to be Obama making people accept  LBGT by force, but I don't think he's going to revoke gay marriage either.\n\nI think Trump as president only has an issue with people who attack Trump, and that's not a race/sex/etc issue.
I think hoverbike sounds better because Hellerbike sounds like something Madea would ride.

You can also collect the audio tapes but I'm pretty sure that falls under the riddler puzzles. It just gets you audio clips that you can listen to in order to get further backstory.
Nah, that would be sexist. It's only racist if it's a blanket statement a specific racial group of employees. For instance the white folks and their constant need to drink coffee like they need an IV of the stuff.\n\n\n\n\nSecondly I think the insinuation is that ladies are far more likely to file false harassment reports. Which could be true or untrue depending on the type of harassment report and whatever research is available on such things.\n\n
Problem with "filling the gaps" is that you can easily sound like a conspiracy theorist while doing so.\n\nFor example, Donald Trump has an allergy to water, I mean fill in the gaps.\n\nA) I've never seen him near a source of water.\n\nB) The white house would never mention an allergy to water.\n\nErgo it must be true.\n\nAnd that's how you get a conspiracy theory.\n\nCommon sense is not a one size fits all answer to things you can't solidly prove, Common sense is stuff like not putting your fingers on a hot stove or chosing not to drive drunk because it's dangerous. Or that Pamphlet written by Thomas Paine. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Sense_(pamphlet)\n\nAnd for the record I have no idea if Trump has a water allergy, but I figured the example was just silly enough that no one here would take it seriously.\n\nSoros may be the real life Dr. Evil but that doesn't mean you can just claim he did stuff without proof.\n\nedit: and on that note, whenever someone throws the words "Common" and "Sense" around, you should probably look harder into what they are saying because they're probably trying to convince you that everyone agrees with them and not that they're actually right. e.g "common sense gun control". If something was really common sense, you'd probably already know it. I'm not saying go test every hot stove and give yourself 3rd degree burns, I'm saying try to find conflicting or alternate sources for that thing and then consider whether or not it can be proved if someone calls it common sense.

This could offer some cool new themes.\n\nFor example something closer to some of Vivaldi's features where you can pull the UI color from the most active color on the page, or set certain colors at certain time periods. (or however that works)\n\nOr perhaps a theme that has some kind of sun icon floating in the background, slowly shifting it's position throughout the day based on the current time and whatever sun up/sundown info the extension can gather. Although that may eat up ram as a terrible idea.\n\n

I use a smartphone, but more often then not it's for situations where it's less feasible to carry a laptop around or be tethered to the cords of a desktop.\n\nI generally prefer a desktop/laptop because I want a larger screen and keyboard, but I also like the mobility that a Smartphone offers when I need it.\n\nMy phone more often then not is used as a camera and notepad, except when I'm not doing anything important and have a few mobile games I can waste time with, or surf reddit. I've pretty much just been using a spreadsheet app that came with my samsung galaxy for writing a lot of stuff because I found it better then using the memo app even though it still leaves a bit desired. \n\nOverall though I think Android and IOS work well if you need the mobility, but they aren't as great when you want the screen real estate and the productivity boost of a full size keyboard.
I'd rather them do a flashpoint style story where Scarlet Witch teams up with  all new MCU Dr Doom for some reason and creates a reality warp where her brother and vision are brought back to life, but due to science and magic she accidentally invents mutants in the current world.
And all the while, they're all getting their butts kicked by a Slade Wilson bloodlusted by the Mirikuru/legion of doom.\n\nActually if season 2 slade could just join the Legion that could be cool too. He's a soldier in a way that Darkh and Malcom are not, and with Mirikuru bloodlust he could be a wildcard.\n\nOn a unrelated note, I kinda want the legion of Doom to borrow grodd, and by borrow I mean throw him in a time period where a giant ape could have a lot of fun and Mick could stupidly offer him a banana. Have Grodd partially inspire the movie King Kong in say the roaring 20s.
I figured the spirit of arkham was less a tape and more of a transcription, but maybe it was encoded somehow.\n\nBut yeah I'm talking about the patient interviews.
speak for yourself
Felicity gets abducted by her hacker friends and becomes an OMAC, the first real OMAC, based on Queen/Palmer technology.\n\nI figure if I keep saying Felicity becomes an OMAC it may actually happen eventually.
I think the sensible approach would be to scale down benefits, rather then canceling them abruptly.\n\nFor instance if the person makes 1 dollar more, why not only give them 399, or whatever level of money the government determines would allow them to afford childcare and work.\n\nBeing financially solvent shouldn't be an either or deal.
I find it funny that people are all outraged that Trump is attacking the press when these are the same billion dollar institutions that a place like reddit would shun because they wouldn't give a fair shake to Bernie Sanders. Also how many people swore that corporations didn't have freedom of speech, but now that it's the corperate press being attacked they suddenly do.\n\nABC is owned by Disney.\n\nNBC is owned by comcast.\n\nCBS is probably owned by national amusements, but is still pretty rich considering they have like 3 billion in revenue. They're also a sister company to Viacom, whom I'm pretty sure doesn't have the best internet reputation either.\n\nCNN is owned by Timewarner, which is the third largest entertainment company.\n\nWhile Trump's attacks on the press might be a bit offensive, I can't say that I feel that many tears over it considering how much power these institutions actually hold.\n\nPlus I can't actually see Trump actually limiting the presses ability to speak freely, at least without a court case or massive amounts of backlash.\n\nI think if Trump really wants to raise a stink, he'd start trust busting them. Break up companies like Disney and Time warner in a personal vendetta. I think breaking Time Warner or Disney into pieces would do far more lasting damage to them then just calling them an enemy of the american people.
Proof?\n\nSnopes.com says it's self funded, and while wikipedia says it's partially owned by Proper Media (a company that operates websites like TV tropes), I can't find anything tying them to Soros. Plus the fact that Soros does fund certain groups isn't proof that he funds Snopes.\n\nA claim made by a website isn't proof of anything until they have concrete evidence.\n\nSnopes being a biased website doesn't mean that we should believe any random website that claims it's funded by Dr. Evil. Instead of relying on "fact checkers", do your own fact checking.

I don't own a Wii U but my brother in law has one and it's a pretty solid gaming device when you have a group of people playing games or just one person gaming while others watch tv. It also works as a tv remote in case you lose the remote. Nintendo does really well at getting a group of people to play together, but they also make solid single player experiences. Mario Maker is also occasionally fun if you have one person who builds a level and then decides to share it with other people ~~to torture them~~.\n\nI think the Switch will work really well for mobile gaming though just because it's a device that's practically meant to be shared vs one that you keep to yourself.

And even then, there's some restaurants that you can really only find in some states but not in others.\n\nFor instance there's maybe one Chick-fil-a in the state of wisconsin. You could live your entire life in wisconsin and not know what chic-fil-a tastes like.\n\nHaving traveled across a couple states, there's some regional chains like steak and shake that I had previously never heard of until I went farther south where people were crazy about it.\n\nThere's regional chains that you'd probably only be aware of if you traveled a lot, or you were a local. Or just some chains that aren't available in every state.\n\nThat's ignoring the places you might miss out if you only went for places that exist in several cities or states.\n
My favorite thing about Prometheus is he's all about the asymmetric warfare.\n\nEvery step he's taking is designed to cause Oliver to question himself and destroy his relationships with his teammates and city. He's not fighting Oliver directly, he's attacking his resources and team mates.\n\nI wouldn't be surprised if Prometheus next causes a massive prison break and pulls a Bane, tiring Oliver out and nearly breaking him.\n\n
I think one explanation is that advertising can use older people because it makes the kids playing feel cool and grownup. \n\nOf course I don't think they're ever going to hit a perfect sweet spot for advertising that adults will buy games for but kids won't. Unless they're all out showing boobs and screaming profanity but that would never fly for a American television commercial.
Maybe kids don't have the emotional and intellectual baggage that comes with being an adult.\n\n\nThey lack experience in pretty much everything, but they're also at the age where they can learn things relatively quickly when they set their minds to it.\n\nAdults will compare the current scenario to what they already "know" based on their preconceived notions. Kids will look for an answer, even if it's the answer the parents would never take.\n\nAdults follow adult rules, kids don't know those rules yet and so the stupid ones don't apply.\n\n\n

Eh, Hippie has a good sized population sometimes, but I think they have more of a murdery reputation then goon does.\n\nThat said, I think goon's rules are fine as is because after the initial shock of someone painting floor tiles into swastikas, eventually I just want to crowbar their artwork up because it's not really that funny in the first place.\n\nMeme Edgelords aren't really the kind of people you want on a server like goonstation because if they're incapable of following one simple rule, chances are they may not be inclined to completely follow the others.
I'm still waiting for some engineer to wire a self destruct button into the entire ship.
When Kwik Trip bought the land that was previously occupied by a gas station and hardees in my area, a lot of teenagers probably bought the kwik trip cups for that reason. I think they offered a free cup deal that attracted a lot of people towards drinking the big buddy cups. (32 oz I think)\n\nPersonally I go for convenience most of the time so I buy a plastic bottle of soda that isn't embarrassingly large.\n\nOtherwise I'd probably would buy the 32 oz cup just because I can fill it with a soda and use a flavored syrup with ice if I want. It's also at a price range where "Yeah I'll probably drink that much through the day" and "No I don't think that's too expensive" roughly align.\n\nThat said, A large soda at mcdonalds is about 32 oz as well.
Actors and actresses as spies seems like the perfect cover though.\n\nIt's a group of people who already assume various identities, travel large distances in the course of doing their jobs, and could get access into government facilities because they're famous and would never otherwise be suspected as a spy because who's gonna question Seth Rogen when he claims that he simply walked into the situation room to get high, Or Johnny Depp because he claims he was "Doing research for an upcoming movie"\n\n

Oh fuck off.
1) You are still misunderstanding what happened. Reread my first post.\n\n2) Don't be so dramatic.
You're right. We actually have more evidence that Clinton is corrupt than we do for Trump.\n\nYou'll have to leave your safe space to find it though.

Don't ask me to waste my time.\n\ntl;dr: Go fuck yourselves.
Stop. Just stop.
I'm not, and no need to explain to you. Your mind is already made up.
> Corruption implies illegal activities\n\nThe fuck it does. It means "dishonest or fraudulent conduct by those in power, typically involving bribery."\n\nAnd even if we lived in your twilight zone and it didn't, who fucking cares. Call it whatever you want, it's still bullshit, and you're still naive.
Maybe it isn't the same group of people and you should stop generalizing.

The article mentioned that the planets are probably tidally locked to their host star, and it mentions that if it had an atmosphere it could mitigate some of the heat. My question is if they are tidally locked would that mean that there are zones near the sunrise/sunset portion of the planet that would be habitable or would the range extend further or to the whole planet?

It's a town hall for all of the constituents of that congressman. Who they voted for should be irrelevant and that person should still be beholden to their constituents to do what is right by them regardless of their choice of president. Maybe they're all Republicans who couldn't stomach Trump so much they voted for Hillary, maybe their democrats, or they might even be third partiers but all of them deserve their voice heard by the person representing them and they are allowed to express their distaste. This is not a Republican only town hall, that would be called a party meeting.

I have 3 former factory birds, used to be 5 but a cat got into my coop one night. It's more than just battery cages. All of my birds have mutilated beaks and cut combs. What we do to these animals is horrendous. Also when my grandfather, who is a farmer, was visiting from Poland, and I remember the disgust in his voice, said they would never allow that kind of shit in Europe.

Every new PhD student should do a replication study as their first research project. It will get their feet wet in the field, they should have a good idea of what they're trying to do, and it enhances reproducibility.

I feel like this has more to do with kids taking everything at face value. You tell them that this fantastical book has all of these impossible things happening and you tell them it is true, then all fantastical books are true. If you tell them all these books are fiction then they remain fiction. Quantum tunneling is an abstract idea that to any rational person would seem fake but reality is otherwise. I could have used Mother Goose's rhymes and if I told kids that these stories actually happened at some time you would still get the same result.

I am a biomedical PhD student, I know the life. I am just saying what the ideal should be. We need to publish papers and if the journals accepted replication studies then we could publish that but no one gives a fuck. Even though new PhD students would not be as good at technique as potentially other groups, with enough replications we should be able to nail down a good result that isn't p-hacked to hell and back.\n\nAlso no, undergrads do not replicate the newer studies they find unknowns in chemical mixtures and do a few simple synthesis.

And a lot of them move between the companies anyway. \n\nExpanding on this I was talking to a professor of mine from undergrad and he said they tend to not take students from the same school on for grad school and then post docs because the broader experience makes them better researchers. I think the same can be said for games, having devs move around can bring the best aspects forward while training out things that don't work.

Kap was dogshit as an actual QB in the 2013 NFCCG.  Sure, he ran it well, but that's about the extent of his qb ability.  Im sure he would be better than Gabbert, but one bad hit and hes a massive fucking liability.  49ers need to accept that they blow and hope they get a qb in the draft.
Its hard to say its exploitation when you signed up for it, where aware of it, and likely had comparable options that would be less demanding.  I mean do you think Goldman Sachs exploits its workers because they often pull 100 hr work weeks?
Yeah but qb is probably one of the only positions where your physical gifts aren't indicative of your abilities.  The fact is, it doesnt matter how athletic he is if he is a hot piece of dogshit at the mental aspect of qbing.
Yeah, but how do you expect to give your underachieving children a leg up on admissions?
Its not the meeting thats the problem.  It's lying under oath that's the problem.    Perjury is serious.  It's hilarious (and sad), but I bet you all would be losing your shit screaming "lock em up" if Sessions had a [D] by his name.

Except Congress and other legislative bodies have specifically passed laws that uphold arbitration clauses, and the Supreme Court has also upheld arbitration clauses.  So, in what sense are arbitration clauses illegal?  Courts are expensive, arbitration offers a more efficient way of dealing with a lot of these problems.
Sure, they will probably get another running back to help out with the usage, but you guys act like Gordon is a hack and wasn't drafted to be San Diego's bell cow despite the fact that he was their 1st round pick in 2015.  You don't draft a RB in the first round if you don't plan on making him a key part of your offense.  Especially once he starts playing well. 
And when has that ever happened on a large scale?
Yes, but the reason that they come here to have you is because they know the US gives you citizenship.  If we didn't, then they would be less likely to come.
Bad idea, law professors are terrible lawyers.
I'm pretty sure they can't cut him because of his injury last year.
Yeah I thought the same thing last year when I had AB, but he was pretty much non-existent when Big Ben went down.  Seemed like he put up 200 yards a game when he was healthy and 40 when he was hurt.  Landry is not good.
I always thought cocaine had a pretty strong smell.
I think using race and gender as a way of attempting to persuade others not to vote for someone will no longer work.  The last couple of elections one of the big mottos of why you shouldn't vote GOP is because of: the war on women, the war on islam, the war on lgbt, etc.\n\n\nWhile I agree with their points and most of their goals, I think a lot of white Americans stopped caring.  The fact is that the democractic party has simply not done a good job of making the plight poor, uneducated whites a pressing issue in their campaign.  I agree that the democrats policies are better for them, but this is democracy and people often vote for the candidate that they think cares about them.\n\n\nI mean one of the biggest criticisms lobbed at Hillary in the primary was how she was against gay marriage, how she supported the 90s crime bill, how she voted to bomb muslims in the middle east.  All of the criticisms were aimed at making their target audience think that she doesnt really care about them or their problems.\n\n\nThe question is how can Democrats show such a different mix of groups that they care about them all? I really don't know and have doubts whether it's possible.
You must not have had AB last year, he was absolute shit without Big Ben.  
Yeah, pirate decks don't require too many epics, but man, renomage has so many.  Fucking dirty rat, doomsayer, ice block, forgotten flame, arcane blast, and soulcaster.  Luckily, you only have to have 1 copy of each, but that was an expensive deck.

I can't see any reason why this would be wrong.  It's not like you are purposely going to lose and take less of the pot.  You are both just hedging your bets, but that doesn't mean that you don't want your original bet to win, just reducing your possible prize for security. 
My father is a farm vet, and the real reason is because it's dirty and physical work.  At least in America, farm vets work for large operations.  Your task isn't to care for the animals in the normal sense; rather, it's to ensure productivity (pregnancy, milk production, beef production, etc.).  \n\n\nThe daily task of rural dairy veterinarians are checking if 100-500 cows are pregnant, requiring you to reach your arm deep down that ass to feel the uterus.  Also, providing vaccines to ensure that disease doesnt spread through the herd.  You will get called to perform actual medical assistance every so often, which essentially requires hog tying them and slicing them up.  The worst part is being called for a cow in labor.  A majority of the time, the calf is dead.  A non-negligible portion of the calls actually require disembodying the calf in the vaginal canal.\n\n\nNeedless to say, most women who want to be a vet because they love animals likely would find this both physically and emotionally taxing.
Right, but that doesn't change the fact that a male that transitioned to female may still have physical traits that make it unfair for her to compete in athletic competitions against other females.
I'm only speaking about farm veterinarians, which I know several women who are farm veterinarians.  It's grueling work that requires you to think of livestock as a commodity instead of an animal.  Maybe it is a stereotype, but most women I've talked to in vet school have no desire to shove their arm up a cows ass 500x a day and the women I know who practice it all switched practices earlier because of their disdain for it. 
You realize its mostly college educated people paying, since you know, they have higher salaries?  Most of the tax in this country is paid by high earners.
Israel is technically at war with Syria, why would they house refugees from them?
Because it's a country of 300 million people and you dont get everything you want because you have to compromise with what other people want.
You have it wrong because all of the current knowledge goes against your position.  So, to logically maintain your position, you would have to refute that knowledge.
Don't tell the fatties that, they want to believe that a salad requires a dedicated housewife to make.
Yeah, and which countries are going to take them out? Their neighbors aren't exactly stable superpowers.
What if it turns out that most people really aren't that creative and instead of artists creating, philosophers debating and scientists experimenting, you just have a bunch of worthless citizens?
Clinton didn't promise to drain the swamp like Trump did.
Good looking out on this, got all of the extra points for redoing the quizzes and just cashed out a $50 gift card.
Also, interest rates are incredibly low, so debt financing is preferable to financing with equity.
Yeah but those same workers you say were exploited are gaining experience and making connections that will land them jobs that will put them, and their children, in a position that would provide them more security than 98% than the US.
Or they should be able to say what they want because we have a right to free expression in this country.  Pence can learn to thicken his skin a bit.

I mean, Hillary spoke about it too, but she said she wanted to increase them.
No they just got the bill, didn't pay it, and the costs were recouped by everyone else.
It would be a disaster if it were legal.  Everyone always points to the fact that alcohol kills far more people while ignoring the fact that it is legal and easily attainable.  I'd reckon we'd have a non-negligble increase in the # of heroin addicts around if I could pick some up from the same aisle the Motrin is in. \n\n\nDecriminalizing it or offering treament centers that can provide it safely, and under supervision, for addicts is a different question.  Either of those routes would probably provide the more benefits with fewer repercussions.    
Drinking was also way more common place than smoking weed too.  Jesus didn't turn that water into weed.
Split evenly among the population?  I know it might be an unpopular opinion, but some people's labor is just more valuable than others.  That's part of the reason why they are rewarded more for it.
Right, but the majority of them are probably all well to decent paying jobs. 
Except you can't do what they do, but I bet they could do what you do.
I mean, this result always seemed obvious to me.  Alcohol is legal and most people really don't have a problem with it.  For a lot of people, illegality is a significant reason for not doing drugs.
What you did was make a statement, that was wrong, and you were corrected.  Just accept your mistake, or at least be careful not to trip with all of that backpedaling your doing. 
You realize they would just take their business elsewhere, right?
I'm sure I am, but the point is that it may pique curious minds that aren't about to go to some ghetto corner to try it.  What happens once those people decide to try it and then decide they really like it?  Hell, they'll like it even more since it'll be pure and unadulterated.  The drug doesn't simply stop being addictive because its legal.  People don't simply stop becoming junkies because something is legal, alcohol certainly proves that point.

The problem is that some of it was fair.  Hillary Clinton sold herself as a public servant who gave her life to help the country.  That might be true, but her and Bill profited in the millions for their "sacrifices."  If Hillary wanted to become president, she should have used her time away from politics to give free speeches at universities, not to charge them hundreds of thousands.  There were dozens of admirable endeavours she could have participated in, but she chose to accept more money than many Americans make in their lives speaking for Goldman Sachs.  \n\n\nSure, Trump is no better--and is actually worse--but at least he wasnt pretending that he has been sacrificing himself as a civil servant.

>Super religious. Anti vaccination. Pro-life. Thinks vegetables can cure cancer.\n\nWhile I agree your friend seems like a twat, all of those are placed in the title as if any one of them negates his/her ability to hold a valid opinion. That is a genetic fallacy, assuming that because your friend holds obviously false opinions, all his/her opinions of equally false.\n\nIn this case, I think the better argument is that this image is a falsehood.  I recall seeing this debunked elsewhere.  Since your friend made the claim that this person was conceived in rape,  it is incumbent on them to (a) support that (as I understood this particular soldier was not, and then if he/she can (b) demonstrate how one particular instance (or even a few similar ones) of a child born into hard circumstances and overcoming that somehow negates the validity of a woman having control over her own body (hint: it doesn't)

Being misinformed isn't a conspiracy, besides, Trump has only been in the White House a month and has only had a few intelligence briefings.  Give me a break.\n\nHow about focussing on real issues instead of made up ones.
Until they'd pushed her it was just harassment but that took it to assault.  Those morons only got a taste of what they deserve.
Of course we believe in them, what a non-argument.  However even the SCOTUS has ruled that basic principals like free speech are subject to limitations.  For example, you can't libel someone or slander them and claim First Amendment protection.\n\nAll founding principals are subject to limitations that are reasonable and to suggest they should not be is wrong.  My pursuit of happiness, for example, cannot be at the expense of your right to security, so I can't invade your house and claim it's now mine because other laws and principals abridge my right to do so (I would be much happier living in Bill Gates house but my pursuit of happiness doesn't entail the right to move on in).\n\nLike I said, use some common sense.

Let's be real:  the Oscars are the trade show awards for an industry that is increasingly out of touch with what we want to watch.  Seeing a group of self indulgent and spoiled rich people congratulate each other just doesn't interest most of us.
I cannot overestimate how despicably cowardly racism is.
As I have noted elsewhere, this sort of reasoning is beyond stupid and displays a total ignorance of how the courts work in relationship to government.  Every person, organization and group has the right to be heard in court on issues of interest to the general public.  To deny a religious group that right or to say "how dare they! Let's strip them of their benefits they have under law" would be the same as the government taking away your car if you challenge a speeding ticket.  \n\nIt doesn't mean the Mormons will influence the final decision but they, like you, have a right to be heard by the court on issues of public interest.  What they do not have, once the courts decide if they law is constitutional and in the public interest, is the right to ignore it or to claim exemption from its affect.\n\nThis post is stupid.

What gets me is that the President has only been in office for a month and people are clamouring for his impeachment (on what grounds, I have no idea)!   Ed Rogers (Washington Post) said it best after the visit from the Canadian Prime Minister: \n\n>Leave it to a Canadian to be the adult in the room. McCullough writes that the American media deemed the news conference a disaster “because it was so calm and on-topic. Big-shot Washington journalists wanted to get their president to talk about (Michael) Flynn.” And, as he points out, the journalists who asked questions about Canada at that news conference were “condemned for wasting everyone’s time.”\n\n>The media only wants to generate bombastic, histrionic stories about the demise of the Trump administration and the general destruction of the United States. \n\nEnough with these fake news idiots.  If they can't get a story, they create hysteria over a non-story.  Sick of me all.\n\n

Victims of real rape do but you and the 'many other women' have created a false narrative in your minds based on misogynistic events.  How many men rape?  All?  How many boys are taught growing up that its acceptable to rape? Most?  How many rapists are celebrated, praised by out culture?  All?\n\nThe very fact that you must answer no to those questions (or you live in some fantasy land) means we DO NOT HAVE A RAPE CULTURE IN AMERICA.  We simply don't and your continued insistence on saying we do is complete BS based on a false narrative that you and others like you insist on perpetrating.  Its "fake news", false propaganda and reasonable feminists like myself are sick of allowing the lies to shape the narrative any longer.\n\n>A culture that thinks street harassment and sexual assault like grabbing a woman's butt is not only okay, but she should be so lucky to get hit on, and she should be so lucky to not have it worse like in other countries. \n\nAgain, for the record, considering how many videos, stories and vilifications there are online about this sort of behaviour just proves my point.   Our culture does NOT think that either of these is "okay".  If it did, complaining about it would bring universal condemnation instead of universal support.  Get that false narrative that our 'culture' supports this our of your head.   Just one example (catcalling during a catcalling report) got 1.8 million views on your tube, almost 2000 comments and all supportive of the poster.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oG1_hw7UhsM\n\nThat would simply NOT HAPPEN in a "rape culture".  The video would have been either vilified or the posted attacked.  \n\nShoshana Roberts' anti-catcalling ​video went viral and received huge support across America.  Again, simply not going to happen if she lived in a 'rape culture'.  \n\nAnd so on and so on.  Your viewpoint is skewed, your narrative false and its time you stop.

Both ways.  The President needs to stop tweeting and just do the job we elected him for.  meanwhile, the press has got to stop trying to create issues every time they can.

Actually, you have your facts wrong.  Studies have shown that as a percentage of the population Christians are declining but in total numbers they are still increasing.  It is just that the increase is lower (by % of pop) than the numbers of people born.\n\nFor example, I read one study (Barna? Maybe Pew?) that suggested there will be around 5 million or so more Christians in America in fifty years, but 50 million or so more people ( I can't recall the exact numbers, but it was something like that)
Splitting hairs is stupid.  Civil damages would not be awarded if you were protected by the First Amendment, as you well know. \n\nStop being stupid.   You can be charged with defamation as well and defamation per se does not require proof that the statement was defamatory only that it was false.\n

Thimiserol, an ethyl mercury derivative, is currently used as a preservative in a few vaccines. As regards, children, I believe only the influenza vaccine contains thimiserol.  DTaP, polio and Hib vaccines have not contained this preservative since 1997-98.\n\nAnd the response is appropriate, as the amount of thimiserol is almost 0 (you get more mercury in a can of tuna. Specifically, 0.32 parts per million of mercury).  \n\nYou also get aluminium in vaccines and formaldehyde may be used in processing, but again, not at levels of concern.   By the way. aluminium is also found in mother's milk, so for god's sake don't breast feed  /s

I wonder if Obama ever skipped briefings? 
I am corrected.
> Sadly, at its current state, the project still has a long way to go \n\nI don't think this is sad at all.  I think it is exciting as what we can barely do know, for various reasons including limitations of time, math, computing power, etc., I expect us to be doing with skill within fifty years.  For example, using DNA to store data and (with some breakthroughs) an anticipated change in how we process data as well as with the development of algorithms that can describe what we are trying to do, I expect that mapping at least simple organisms will be (in time) routine.    How is this sad?  Its exciting science.
My first thought too.  I doubt she is anything but a sweetheart.
That false statistic is just so much bullshit, its annoying.
And then they will post how the police abused their authority by arresting them.  I know.  People can be smart but they so often choose to be morons.
His border 'edict' (a very bad idea the way he worded it, although no one is talking about the fact that Obama put out an order to have people from those same countries subject to additional screening) and the fact that when the press does get together with him, they can't seem to focus on topic because they are so out for blood, so all we hear about is what they want to talk about.  (An excellent article by Ed Rogers in the Washington Post about the ineptitude and bias of the media. see below for a sampling:\n\n>For instance, no less than Thomas Friedman from The New York Times wrote, “We were attacked on Dec. 7, 1941, we were attacked on Sept. 11, 2001, and we were attacked on Nov. 8, 2016.” Really?? Friedman thinks Trump’s election as president is a situation tantamount to Pearl Harbor and 9/11? Talk about not giving the man a chance. Friedman doesn’t even say the Trump presidency as it unfolds over the next four to eight years could be akin to an attack on the United States; he thinks the sheer fact that Trump won the election is, essentially, an act of war.\n\n>Even The Washington Post has fed into the narrative that the Trump administration is off the rails, from headlines including “Flynn departure erupts into a full-blown crisis for the Trump White House” and “Flynn episode ‘darkens the cloud’ of Russia that hangs over the Trump administration” to “The president lays the groundwork for a nationwide voter intimidation program” and “Donald Trump is suddenly looking like a very weak autocrat.” Can we pause for a moment?\n\n>Trump has been president for less than a month, and Democrats and their allies in the media are already howling that he is an abject failure. I’m no Trump toady, but so far, Trump has had one poorly drafted executive order and one or two personnel misfires and has fed the flames with some clumsy media performances, but this isn’t that unusual. Does anybody remember Zoe Baird?\n\n\nDuring the meeting with Canadian PM Trudeau, reporters who asked about Canada were actually ridiculed by their colleagues for going 'soft' on Trump.  Ridiculed for sticking to questions that were actually relevant to the meeting!  That is how ridiculous this has become.

Clearly you can't reason your way out of a wet paper bag, so fuck off.
I see this kind of comment and wonder what you are thinking.  When it comes to social issues (this is a social issues not a political  one) every organization that is open to the public has a right to have a say.  What they don't have, once the law is passed and the court challenges over, is a right to dissent just because they are religious.  \n\nSaying "oh my god, they are asking for an opinion, they must lose their tax status" is just stupid.  The same freedom to express my opinion and your opinion in front of the court must be theirs as well.   Look how many court cases the religious have lost recently.  Atheist organizations have won case after case.  American Atheist is a non profit.  Should they lose their tax free status if they were to ask for intervenor status in court cases?  They are engaged in all kinds of court cases right now,  but by your reasoning, they shouldn't have a tax free status if they do.   \n\nIt's a stupid point of view.
Fair enough
"No, no I did not."
In the real world we call that being mentally ill.
To claim that "lots" of a sub group support something, it is only valid if you can point to evidence.  Unfortunately an opinion that this a statement is true doesn't make it true.   Can you demonstrate evidence of your assertion?  If not, then stating it as you did is called an appeal to authority and isn't a reasonable argument.  \n\nBasically it's incumbent on the author of the statement to provide support when making assertions of this sort.
This is a case of "thank god she thought he was cheating on her" and good for you!  Sucks to be her though.  Hope she paid you.

My father died when I was 10 years old.  He suffered a major heart attack while we were camping.  I ran to the campsite next door and told the man who was there what was happening. He said (and boy, do I remember every second of THAT day) "I don't know what to do."\n\nI said "we need to call an ambulance down at the camp office." ( no cell phones then)\n\nThis advice is bang on.  By being specific the man was able to do something that was actually helpful (even though my father still died, that 911 call started a whole range of activity that was necessary).  Even a child can do that much.
McCaskill should set a good example and resign.  
Equal pay for exactly the same job, hours and responsibilities is common sense.  Equal pay for two different jobs, responsibilities and hours is not.  Notwithstanding this morons suggestion that men should earn more (if a man works longer hours, or a job with a higher scale, then sure, but otherwise that is a moronic idea), the reality is when you look at national figures and compare types of work, hours worked, etc etc., women and men make the same money.  \n\nThe bottom line is that when you have a job with a pay range, hours, etc., it doesn't make any difference who is doing it.  
No, its the media, according to their own colleagues:\n\n>The media only wants to generate bombastic, histrionic stories about the demise of the Trump administration and the general destruction of the United States. The media is getting a little ahead of itself. \n\nEd Rogers, Washington Post

Most murders of black men are by other black men.  That doesn't make it less of a tragedy when a black American is killed by a white, or Asian, etc., it is just that the media skews the stats to make it seem like black America is under attack by white America (hint: its not. Most murders of white people are also by blacks, but white America isn't under attack by black America either, its just that more black Americans are criminals at this time.  The reasons for that are what need to be addressed, not just pulling out numbers in a vacuum.)

> You absolutely have the right to film them in public\n\nActually, the court said specifically that this right is not absolute and does not apply everywhere.   I suspect if you were filming a bust where undercover officers were involved as well as uniformed officers, the police would have the right to prevent you and confiscate your cameras if your video could harm an undercover officers ability to do their job in the future, or even expose them to potential harm.   There may also other scenarios that it could be argued filming the police may interfere with their ability to do their job, or infringe on other innocent civilian's right to privacy.   Privacy laws do not permit infringement where that may publicize the individual in a false light, so if you filmed an innocent transaction that led others to reasonably believe that individual was engaged in criminal activity, or posted the video with that inference, you could be violating the law. \n\nIn short, you should use common sense.  If its an ordinary police action, then I expect the police to not infringe on a person's first amendment right to film them.  Otherwise, just because you can doesn't always mean you may.\n
Its ironic that the 'tip' was originally developed so that white men would be able to hire black former slaves as servers and not pay a wage.  The 'tip' was the choice of the partron, so the server worked his ass off to earn it.\n\nWhen wages were finally forced on restaurants, instead of a living wage, a low wage was agreed to as the servers got the difference in tips.   There is a slow backlash against this, with a few restaurants eliminating tipping by raising prices slightly but insuring their staff gets a decent wage.    
A lot of people say "God told me to do such and such"  but this is one I can actually approve of
Racists are all cowards, I submit.  The courage to face up to your own prejudices and ignorance is what takes someone from sheep to survivor, from child to adult.

This is why 1) all rape claims should be investigated by the police prior to any action being taken by a college. And 2) false accusations should be a felony subject to the same period of time in prison as rape.

There is a time lapse video here:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PdantUf5tXg\n\nYou can see where the crowd peaks in size, and then when everyone leaves. The view that Trump had doesn't reflect this, because the angle was different.
Maybe that's not what he meant by "take care of them".
Comparing him to Hillary is useless and not applicable. She will not be President and barely anyone even wants her to run again. A better comparison is between Trump and the two previous Presidents:\n\n>Two days after the Supreme Court decision that made George W. Bush president-elect in 2000, he held a press conference in Austin. He took questions from reporters about his potential Cabinet picks, whether he would call for tax cuts and when the weight of being the next president of the United States hit him. \n>George W. Bush holds a press conference Dec. 17, 2000, where he named Alberto Gonzales chief White House lawyer, Condoleezza Rice (next to Bush) national security adviser and Karen Hughes (far right) counselor.\nJ. Scott Applewhite/AP\n>The next day, Bush introduced his choice for secretary of state and took more questions. The day after that, he answered yet more questions during a press conference to introduce his national security adviser and White House counselors.\n\n>President-elect Barack Obama followed a similar pattern, regularly fielding questions from reporters, as he made choices about who would serve in his administration. **In all, Obama fielded questions from the White House press corps on 18 different occasions as president-elect. George W. Bush, who had a shorter transition period, did so 11 times.**

Those who are still employed have issues as well:\n>Now that Trump has won, coal workers around the country have sent an SOS to the president-elect to quickly stem the bleeding.\nHundreds of coal workers sent an open letter on Thursday to Trump demanding "action that will bring relief to coal communities."\nSpecifically, the coal workers called for legislation to protect miners' health and retirement benefits and to pay for the retraining of workers.\nThe coal workers also called out coal CEOs and execs for continuing to "reap multi-million dollar bonuses" even while slashing jobs and proposing cuts to pensions.\n\n
Or lack of propaganda?
Agreed. I have 4 SBC starters and two on the bench (Payet and Son). So great to be able to not worry about those spots. Only wish I did Dembele. http://imgur.com/HKyiYSA
Then why was Flynn fired?
> I can't wait for him to start having official press conferences \n\nAgreed!
Most of those games were played in division 1 through 3, WL, or WL Qualifiers. Just my observation. 
Yeah it was bright red blood from my asshole, no worries. 
> And not even a day after Spicer says this, Cali introduces a bill to repeal the law too.\n\nWhat bill is this?

This is pretty standard for SOTU speeches.  \n\nRepublicans cheered for a $1 Trillion Infrastructure bill, which they would not have done if Hillary was delivering the speech.
>Attorney General Jeff Sessions says he will recuse himself from a federal investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 White House election.\n\n>Sessions faced mounting pressure from both Democrats and Republicans to step aside after revelations that he had twice talked with Moscow’s U.S. envoy during the presidential campaign. Sessions’ conversations with the ambassador seem to contradict his sworn statements to Congress during his confirmation hearings.
Not now could-of-bot
Not gospel, no. However, I'm not a liberal and I check both of these sites frequently. I have a lot of family and friends who are constantly posting unverified articles and claims. These two websites **help** parse out the truth from the fabricated. And if you disagree, they cite every claim they make with backup sources and articles. You can do your own research and see if they are being legit or not. I have disagreed with them several times on **tone** but they generally lay out all the facts and evidence to support their claims.
What leaked? Link?
But she was on TV. The "media" was "reporting" whatever came out of her mouth at the time. This wasn't some obscure print interview.
Size nein
Using your logic, should Trump have not been invited in year's past?
Thanks! \n\nBut it's not a "repeal". It's a bill asking the Fed government to respect State laws regarding legalization. Also, it was introduced on Feb 7th - not "a day after Spicer says this".\n\nIt was introduced by Dana Rohrabacher a staunch conservative.
I upvoted your post, because it was interesting and relevant. But I gotta ask, WHO is reading the statement as an endorsement of Jim Crow? Most takes I see infer she is ignorant of the reason HBCUs were created.
Ahhhh, the Wikileaks method. 
Its pronounced love / hate relationship.
Yeah. Barring men that hold fat in weird places (most of men hold fat in their gut) if you can see individual abs, your at around 12%.
Manicured beard vs man beard have different appearance yo. I work in SF. See lots of manicured men. Also see huge burly dudes with beards that look like they can throw the manicured bearded men.
So you mean the one time its good to have high body fat content? That's hilarious.
I agree completely. Start looking for a new gym if at all possible.
Microsoft has been in Seattle since 1986 and Bill Gates is from Seattle. I don't think its California that did what it did to Seattle. Urban areas attract people that like urban things, like the opposite of military, logging and fishing. If the majority of your population exists in urban areas, your going to see a gross change in the make up of a state. Right now there are 7 million people in Oregon and 4 million of them live in Seattle.
I am very jealous.
I think that you should grow callouses and then keep them shaved thin. That's the best way.
If your getting light headed that points to calorie intake or blood flow. Maybe get more cardio in?
I look like the grumpy cat whenever I do rack pulls / deadlift / squat.
Super curious:  \nSo from my understanding of liberalism vs conservatism, isn't your first point conservative in perspective (family, sex life and genitals).  \n  \nI completely agree with that perspective.
Thank you. I'm a liberal and I literally come here for coherent discussion and additional news sources cause of how fucked our media is. We are all Americans here. We all want the best for our nation and for each other. 
My ex had never dated a guy with muscled before. At first she was intimidated and then she would repeatedly refer to me as hot... for 1.5 years. Its cool man, she just hasn't ever dated a muscular or even athletic guy.
Nice man! I love the stacked tables and box for mirror stand. Make do with what you got!
My bad.  Used the All 0 character for the hybrid fit and didn't give any thought to the result.\n
I'm sorry, I left the word trading in my post. I meant to say something to the effect of "parting ways" with players once they are over the hill / not as good as they appear to be.
I think you have the tail wagging the dog here. 
I laugh as a response to avoid crying. Kind of like, when crying isn't even the appropriate response.
HAHAHAHAHAHA
This is me.
I've taken the last 2 weeks off from gym... still food prepping and on my cut.. just giving myself time and space to make changes and just do nothing. Its really shitty sitting with yourself when your sad. Sigh.
Its the only way i can get it tight enough
Beards and muscles are pretty intensely masculine things.
As a middle eastern person gonna say that if you do that your gonna have a bad time.
I love Run the Jewels for working out. So good. \n\n"You can all run backwards through a crowd of dicks!"
From my perspective, there is a huge difference between the charter school or similar system, it's merits and otherwise, and existing in a time with Jim Crow. So no, although I think it's reprehensible that black students get a worse education than white students, on average, I don't think there is a lot in common with living at a time where black students were legally banned from going to college.  It's just different. \n  \nI'd personally go further to say that I think the idea of choice when it comes to schools as a negative thing, specifically because separate typically denotes unequal.  \n  \nThis all being said, I have to see Devos' goals and plan before I comment. 
Working hard is a matter of choice. Sometimes when I'm feeling out of it, I'll tackle a number of smaller tasks to get my engine going. Then when I'm feeling more coherent, I'll handle the "boulders" (Complex tasks requiring lots of thought and time).
switch to cocaine
I did that and then tried to play soccer. Failed hard.
You mean that because your team has a history of trading away players when they have peaked or are just in general not as good as their hype people shouldn't be wary of a Belichick bearing gifts?  \n  \nThink of it as a complement. NE has consistently been using the rest of the NFL from a player personnel perspective. It's like you guys are playing soccer and the rest of the NFL hasn't figured out how to use their feet yet (on average).
Thats literally the worst thing that can happen. Was that really THAT bad? No, it wasn't. Continue talking to women until you get a date.
About a month out from break up and honestly things are starting to get better. I'm going to the gym regularly, seeing friends and family and started on the dating apps. Started talking to latina occupational therapist and its nice to just enjoy talking to someone who gets things like I do. Gonna take this all slow.  \n  \n5'11.5 and I'm up to 192 from the end of my cut at 182. Hoping to hit 200 before I start cutting for the summer. Going to be the 31 year old dude looking like a 24 year old.  \n  \nGonna voice something that might seem political, but its not meant to be. Mostly the emotional result. I'm Iranian (Persian) and holy shit the hatred I feel through all the politics is so intense. I know its not directed at me, but it is... if that makes sense. Just feels like a continuation of how much it sucked being a young middle eastern man after 9/11. Trying to just be positive and get through a time where it feels like my entire life fell apart (sister, girlfriend and general political climate).  \n  \nAnyways, sorry for sharing stuff that might be out of bounds here. Not trying to make this into a political debate, just trying to express my feelings. Hope you all have a wonderful day, get your lifts, girls, guys, grapefruits or 1RM's.
Most people just cook plain meat and expect it to be good.
Steve Young.\n
This is why I never talk to women at the gym unless they talk to me or are obviously hovering. Leave people the fuck alone! Sorry about the cringyness :(
Truth. Kind of wish we just had a green / yellow / red light above our heads so people could get that I want them to go away without having to be rude.
Typo in your first sentence? In two years?
I'm looking too. Give me that pretty face and awesome posterior chain and I can be happy.
Its hair. Its a hobby in the same way growing fingernails is a hobby. People all want some reason to feel special. Stupid participating trophies from childhood.
Dafuq?

That's exactly what I'm describing. Your feet might not be used to the shoes your using. Last time I went hiking I wore my Nike frees and my feet were tired because I didn't wear stiff / firm soled shoes. I'm thinking a similar situation.
Who cares about how he looks. Its just annoying to see people posing in the weight room is people are there... you know, lifting weights?!
After a weekend in San Diego eating and drinking everything in sight, still at 196.5 lb. The cut begins.
Post relationship sadness does all my appetite suppression
Used to lift because of a crippling fear of inadequacy. Then I continued lifting because the women that I was interested in wanted men like that. Then I realized the discipline that I developed through my workout life was reaching into other parts of my life. Now I'm a semi organized dude with a good job that I'm known to be awesome at, a good salary and doing the work is easy. Its cause bodybuilding requires you to sacrifice. Once you learn that process, its just a matter of applying it to the rest of your life.
dude, say it right - blond twink.... ;)
I would love this. I'm just now getting better at food prep and although I make pretty good roast veggies + protein + rice / potatoes, some more combined meals would be legit!
Went to the doctors office for a checkup. I weighed 197.5 lb. Problem. Way too much fat accumulation too quickly. Gonna cut down again and see what I'm working with. Going to San Diego and going to stay at hostel. Anyone in SD want to party? Where should I go to meet women?
You and me both man. Its time to cut. Will look less good in clothes but great naked.
I watched a lot of their games last year and I think he played as well as you could expect a first year player to play. CJ and Booker were hit in the backfield most of the time, and when CJ went down, Bookers lack of elusiveness / vision killed what little success the running game could have. The ability to score on the offense rested squarely on Siemian's shoulders. I'd take a shot at him.
Is your girl face sitting you too hard while you sleep?
Based on all the misinformation that is bouncing around about marijuana in general, running a lie, any lie about marijuana seems entirely likely and something any politician would do. \n
Not right wing, but would 100% participate in the intimidation of congress. No bullshit, regardless of political affiliation, fuck most of those people.
Don't get me wrong. I'm being super social and seeing friends and family 3-4 times a week. I just need time to work on myself and do my own thing. I'm at kind of a midlife crisis where I realized that a lot of my decisions and way of life were based on what other people wanted from me, not what I wanted for myself. Things like realizing i dont care about rising up the corporate ladder and dont want to be a manager / vp of anything. Also just realizing I have terrible taste in women and need to pursue the opposite of women that I'm attracted to.
Lats let me fly away from my problems.
If this was pre the four loko change, you might have died.
Why not both?
I didn't read the press statement to mean that Devos supports Jim Crow. I think that is a huge leap to go from a press release where Jim Crow is never referred to, to saying she is supportive of it. You can be supportive of a solution without being supportive of the problem.\n\nThat being said, I think its pretty disingenuous to draw a correlation between HBCU's and the charter system. One existed because of gross legal inequality in our nation, while the other is a concept on how best to provide access to schooling for all students, regardless of background. Are there things that can be learned from HBCU's to be applied to schools at large?\n\nI also think its ridiculous to draw comparisons between HBCU's and how choice improves education. The whole point to HBCU's in the first place was that large portions of our population (read: black people) did not really have a choice. It was HBCU's or nothing. \n\nThat being said, this press release, like all things in politics, is just trying to build support for her. No qualms against that - play your game. I would love to hear other perspectives on the actual press release, though.\n\nCheers!
Where are you deploying to? My buddy got deployed to middle of buttfuck no where afghanistan and they made concrete weights cause in the winter travel was impossible so they just stayed in their outpost.
Manly / broad backed women are really hot. There are less of you than dudes that lift. Take your pick of us!
Did you start working on EARN?   The readme you have posted sounds like you plan to overlap a lot with Eve Thing https://github.com/madcowfred/evething   \n\n
We all have been there. Thats one of the ways we learn to not be a dufus.  For me, I find things I don't like about her and turn the sour grapes angle or I just push her out of my mind and focus on other things I can obsess about. Whether that is a book, hobbies, etc.
I just saw an obviously college girl in sports wear bouncing around. I'm not mad, but I'm definitely confused.\n
Cause i'm not trying to attach my happiness as a person to spending 10 hours a week lifting weights. Well, I should say, I've done that, and its hard. Trying a change.
Dude don't do creatine. its dangerous. stay natty.
Haha seriously!
Keep it up. You might feel like you are losing a lot, but you aren't! Plus you get to start building fat wheels again!
There will be other women you love, but I'm sorry. Just went through a breakup and its rough.
masturbate /u/3billygoatgruff for 15 minutes for your special sauce.
Trump's speech made me want to believe in him. The entire GOP's words make me want to believe in them. I will wait for action, because that is all that matters.
Socialism =! Liberalism
Date yesterday had to bail because of work. Not sure what her interest level is at this point. Mine is mostly in the, "I've been broken up for a month and want someone to touch me." Oh well, got to finish food prep and wander around in the beautiful weather instead. Was a nice afternoon to just do whatever the fuck I wanted for once.\n\nIn other news, cut is going okay. Seeing weights as low as 195 lb, so about 1-2 lb in 10 days is pretty solid. Started running again. Set up 1, 2 and 3 mile loops by consulting the google maps. The goal is to be hitting 3 miles @ 7 minute pace in the next few months. Right where I was about 2-3 years ago.  \n  \nIts leg day today! Woohoo! Not. Hate this day on cuts.
Best story conclusion.
Two things happen:  \n1. Release of brain chemicals that make you feel good. Even after a mediocre workout, you should feel good.  \n2. The accumulation of gains makes you feel good.  \n  \nSo yeah, you should feel happier :).
Oh! hahaha I was so confused!
Yep. The lift is only from the ground to lockout.
Thats what I do with condoms. Magnums? Hahahah yea right!
Totally agree with your assessment!
Mostly those things
But that would require people to live in Texas instead of California. Literally the only thing going for you in that battle is guns and cost of living. 
Crushing it. Nice man!
Big is over 200. I'm not big yet.
I'm a liberal person and I never knew about this. I think the headline and majority of the first paragraphs are outrageously misleading, but the practice is ridiculous. It literally sounds like whoever is in office can just funnel money to whatever groups they want based on whatever settlements are occurring at the time. Its so incoherent it hurts my brain. This needs to stop.

If you havent been doing calf exercises, then yeah. Soreness is a reflection of how used to an exercises your body is, typically. If its sore all of a sudden, maybe your doing better reps.
I think it's individuals that believe marriage is a religious thing. I'm with the libertarians on this. If all the LGBT crowd wants is equal rights, let's remove the religious part of it from government and anyone who wants to be "unioned" or whatever we call it can have it. 
Wtf, I like Hannity now?
Or throw the couple off the roof into the cake. We have much more precedent for that.
Hollywood conservatives are a rare breed. We need to support and encourage these guys so potentially more of them (if any) feel free to come out of the closet and express their views. 
Who. Gives. A. Flying. Fuck. Buzzfeed.
The more the people I know keep repeating comments like this at *every* possible peep and murmur from the media, the more they discredit themselves. 
People on the left at this moment in history resemble fascism more than the people they are calling fascists. 
Well don't we want to make America one big safe space?
People who are warming to Trump because of this speech seriously need to go back and watch full video from the primary debates, full video from his rallies, [the super based Al Smith dinner video where he tears Hillary a new one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bmvxx_YbDsM) and of course, the Presidential debates. \n\nSee if you aren't redpilled after watching this man absolutely tear through ranks of established, experienced, politicians like tissue paper.  
Butthurt Sanders supporter didn't like my post. \n\nhttp://imgur.com/ur6puik
Who broke this story in the first place?
Trump's track record so far indicates that if he made a promise in a speech as to any particulars of what we'll see with the new plan, he WILL deliver that. The Republicans are wasting their time if they think they're going to out-deal this President. \n\nThe GOP is not immune from our ire just because our President happens to align with that party. I see aligning with them as a temporary, necessary evil. A big chunk of them are still globalist, bought-and-paid-for establishment politicians who need to get on the Trump train instead of engaging in fuckery if they want to keep their jobs. 
He's doing both. I want him more stereotypically "Presidential" too, when it counts, just to allow more people who aren't as fervent as us to relax a bit and watch his actual substance rather than his packaging. \n\nAnd just in case any fence sitters or outright MSM-fed critics are lurking this thread, watch THIS video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ud4sHtwLPs&list=PLscoTWg36JipaV892DJZTPjxQqH7YwzD_&index=11
If there's enough evidence to start an investigation, the media at large has no choice but to cover it in *some* capacity.  And if there are charges, we get an absolute media shit storm. With a guy like Sessions in the DOJ, it's hard to imagine there *not* being an investigation if the evidence is truly there. \n\n
That's something that I keep noticing. That there is something somewhat intangible to what we are doing here that one does have to "get". It's based on hard information of course, but with Trump, and conservatism in general, coming from a more liberal background, there's a membrane of truth that you have to punch through that can't be precisely explained to you. \n\nSomeone on the other side trying to crack this is always at a disadvantage because if they "got it" they'd stop working against us and join us. That sounds culty as hell, but it is what it is.
There are more guns than people in the US, right? So according to lefty statistics, we should be losing *significant percentages* of the population to firearms accidents. What is that one stat, that there's an 85% increased chance of dying by firearm if you own firearms. Sure, and there's also a similar chance of being bitten by a dog if you own a dog. Or drowning in a pool if you own a pool. There's also a higher likelihood of being less successful in life if you're a loony, emotional liberal versus being dedicated to accepting hard reality as your foundational operating parameter. \n\nYou know who shouldn't have guns? Angry, rage-filled leftists. Be wary of anyone who rails too hard against guns...they are likely solipsistic and know that they could not be trusted with a firearm, therefore *nobody* should because they see everyone as being like them. \n\n
I identify as a weaponized meat thermometer.
Best approach. He absolutely means well, but he's turned up to eleven, 24/7.
We need Ted to come here and do an AMA. \n\nOn that note, it would be fabulous if /u/the-realDonaldTrump would also drop by again some time soon and say hello. 
So far. 
The only thing that rubs me the wrong way is that their sense of parody is founded on a deep misunderstanding of what is *actually* going on. The left sees politics through the lens of an unsustainable ideology that, if it dominated our culture would crash our entire civilization into the rocks. 
And we should be the mainstream right. We are multi-cultural, multi-ethnic, multi-whatever and we demand true liberty. Donald Trump is our epicenter for now but we will persist with or without him. We are based centipedes who are aware of what America should be. We are true Classic Liberals who believe in the Constitution. If I find myself in the afterlife, I want to see Thomas Jefferson as my own personal Jesus. Get some.
She's hot but I find myself imagining just listening to her talking to me softly with that delicious sounding voice of hers. So soothing.
Might be kinda hot. 
Excellent points. All we're doing is attempting to view reality on reality's terms.

#LOCK HIM UP
All the resistance and upheaval and chaos is only an indication of how deeply corrupt and entangled with outside interests our system has become. \n\nClinton would NEVER have lifted a finger to address these issues. The waterslide into a pool of tyranny, war and corruption would only have steepened under her administration.\n\n#MAGA

It is VERY hard to imagine any of these people voting for a Democrat again, especially after having the most tremendous President any of them could have even dared hope for. Establishment politics in general will be viewed with much suspicion.
Never forget that our President is a hilarious rascal: https://youtu.be/yELV238wr-k

They act like being in a foreign country without permission is somehow okay.
I keep many gallon jugs of drinking water in the basement, which would be good for about a week. I also usually have a full rain barrel to filter. \n\nA house in the country with well water would be ideal, but my cool neighborhood with rising property values is also nice.
It's more like we admittedly have a lot of nutty conspira-tards on our side that we should not feed or encourage in any way. 
As many stumbles as he has made while speaking, mosty off the cuff, when it's all said and done, this President is going to end up with some amazing quotes. 
Yes, it actually is.
This is true because science. 
The vast majority of leftists I know had some childhood trauma, broken home, etc. \n\nNearly my wife's entire family is intact and close and from the kids to the grandparents, they are all definite conservatives. My wife is a product of divorce (and a nice enough but utterly clueless and negligent biological father) and magically, she has leftist leanings...though I've essentially been slipping the redpill into her food bit by bit so to speak. Her step dad is an uber successful Reagan-era conservative corporate real estate guy so the nosedive was mitigated. Love that dude.
Well, we had better get to looking at the best route to peaceful resolution then. Think of it from the standpoint of a parent having a confrontation with a child who is all feelings and no rationality. How do you get through to them to pay attention, think, and listen to reason? 
Don't tell that to the massive, breathlessly hyperbolic /r/worldnews thread on this. 
I'm in a blue city in a red state. My neighborhood is cool as shit but it's even bluer than the city at large. My way to show support is simply to fly an American flag on my porch, which is signal enough amongst people who would *never* wave a flag themselves. 
400 grand isn't shit. I have over a quarter of that and I'm just some asshole on the internet.
I've been thinking about the term "liberal". We need to take that back. Just start by self-identifying as a liberal to ~~liberals~~ leftists. Then watch the confusion as you share your supporting viewpoints. \n\nYou know, since Liberal (capitalized and in political context) means: economic freedom, greater individual participation in government, and constitutional, political, and administrative reforms designed to secure these objectives.\n\nThe "individual participation in government" part is quite important because who would argue with that? The question for leftists is, "How do you think we best accomplish that...by appealing to a large Federal government to hear our voices, or via cities, counties and *states*?"
Exactly the same as "American" not being a race. Mexico is very diverse. 
I think Baldwin's portrayal is pretty good. Yeah, I don't lol at it much, but it's a good parody. Portraying Bannon as Death is super duper ridiculous and shows the left don't understand anything about the guy, but from *their* perspective, it's a hilarious over the top move. It works. \n\nMcCarthy's Spicer had me screaming with laughter though. They *get* his combativeness and general BTFO toward the media. 
One of? Dang, who was better looking?
It's always the same smug cunts, in almost the same order every time. It's almost like they're being paid to post...
It's really no different than us considering Fox News to be a canary in the coal mine for stuff too.
It is glorious. I wish the constant noise, chaos, conspiracy nonsense, conspiracy NON-nonsense and general pro-Trump rhetoric weren't such a formidable beast to the rest of Reddit...it's surprisingly fun and great in here. I went from *hating* this President to *getting* not just this one man, but a whole tone and direction of the country. I'll kick myself forever for not voting for him in 2016.\n\nI know a lot of stuff is not conventional for our Presidency and that freaks out statist, conventional thinking people, but we are witnessing essentially a "defragging" of the hard drive of the nation right now. It will be messy, scary and mistakes will be made, but we can't be paralyzed by fear or a sense of humdrum mediocrity. We're Americans. This moment is absolutely in our wheelhouse. Barack Obama was not, outside of the legit high point that was his election. Obama was a let down, I don't care how smooth or nice he seemed. Trump *is* the man for right now. And all of us in here are going to be better Americans when it's all said and done.

Haha, yeah, he is probably a big component in my slide to the right as well. He's helped so many people not only get out of debt, but build serious wealth as well. 
WORST. RESISTANCE. EVER.
Short term in the city (major metro) we have a creek in the park across the street and some Sawyer gravity filters. Also accessible in neighbor's backyard. \n\nLong term, our bugout is our family's property 45 miles outside the city...two big houses next to one another with farm land and a small lake right behind, at the end of a dirt road.\n\nDefinitely would not stay in town during a true balls-out SHTF event.
Seriously. I live in a major city and it's like being behind enemy lines sometimes. It would be incredible to turn a place like this red. 
Guess which one feminists identify with most.
We need a bot like the ones that give bricks and coats that will add one more Secret Service agent to Trump's guard every time we say a trigger word. 
Just mirror vertically for role reversal.

I generally support people not being able to discriminate against others for race or sexual orientation, but at the same time, it's weird to try and make someone participate in your happy day who at best doesn't approve of you and at worst hates the fact that you exist.
Christian-hating leftists are really only that way because they hate their shitty Dad, or other adult authority figure from their childhood that screwed them up. It's really that simple. 
Source? This would be cool if true.
As much as I love it up there in the Northwest, sometimes I really appreciate living in a solidly red Southern state. Portland is a cool looking city except that its inhabited by the most weak, pointless, insufferable people in the entire United States. 
I think there's plenty of truth to that.
This is really the obvious answer to the whole thing. Trump won despite a massive, often coordinated effort to stop him. Hillary had near total support from the media, and the left in general though Bernie and the subsequent butt fucking he got at her peoples' hands definitely helped her lose. 
And there's *much* less to criticize about Christianity. It's almost tacky to go overboard talking shit about Christians. It's *sane* to level constant criticism against Islam.
After watching the ridiculously high levels of BTFO from Bull Emperor Trump, combined with his knowledge of business and trade, Barney Sandals seems like a weaker choice than ever.
Tolerant left strikes again!\n\nI'm trying to imagine driving around rural Georgia with an Obama sticker on my car in the middle of his administration and getting anything more than a few stares.

Virtually none of my liberal friends (particularly all the low energy, low-skilled, highly dependent Bernie supporters) even seem to have a retirement account. And the ones who do don't know a *thing* about it. They think the stock market is exclusively some sort of rich man's Vegas that exists in a vacuum and doesn't affect them.

I'd love to see Bannon or /u/the-realDonaldTrump drop in here from time to time. Trump certainly has posted here a number of times during the campaign. \n\nIf my President randomly shit posted to this domreddit, it would only confirm we are in the best timeline. MAN OF THE PEOPLE.
He's the guy to do it. 
Care to expand on this? My buddy and I debate this possibility often.
> Our military is probably the least racist and most inclusive group in America. Everyone you fight, bleed, and die with becomes your brother.\n\nI remember all of us in basic training coming to this conclusion very quickly. Multi-racial, multi-religion, multi-everything. We discovered that we were wildly diverse. We even had a Colombian guy who wasn't a citizen yet. 
Just picture the election results instead.
#Press Griefing
I don't watch a lot of cable news and watched Dobbs' show for the first time earlier. Damn that dude is scathing.
He sure acts like it. He used all his time at Sessions' confirmation hearing to go on and on and on about Russia.
It starts with a lack of character and integrity.
You could say Trump is a RINO too, but in the best possible way. He has a mix of centrist views that if held by the GOP in general, would cause me to join and subsequently support a political party for the first time in my life. \n\n
The woman is of a healthy weight and doesn't have unnaturally colored hair. She must be complicit in the patriarchy and needs re-education. 
Hey, on the other hand, I'm happy my tax dollars pay for your paycheck, mili-pede!
Gay?? Bu-bu-but I thought Trump was homophobic? I'm so confused right now.
I do this with my homemade porn to breathe new life into it.
They FEEL like there's evidence because Sessions is yet another boogieman to them even though most of them don't actually know a confirmed fact about him.
If someone comes up to you and mentions that Pepe is a racist symbol, you know right then that they follow mainstream media narrative. Pepe is a symbol of awareness. Pepe is love.
My Dad was first on the Trump train. I was aghast. Now I'm looking forward to telling him in person that I'm on board. My brother may never come around. Those Bernie bros...

This sort of thing happening in the last election with Trump would have only solidified his base against those trying to bring him down. Is the political climate in France similar regarding Le Pen?
"Problematic"
The Democrats are off-balance. They aren't pushing any kind of unified agenda. There is no substance, nothing to get behind. They are like the Russian government itself...unable to win on their own, so they spend their energy trying to diminish others. Not a winning strategy. 
How do we know he wasn't using a teleprompter?
> It's going to be a long eight years for them.\n\nIt's going to be quite a balancing act, demonizing Trump while he makes their constituents' lives better like they never did. 
If you aren't appearing to put social issues before *everything else* then you're racist. Because we're apparently in a civil rights crisis where only fucking white males have legally protected rights.

These no-name news sites should be discarded out of hand as bullshit, especially in the instances when they are the *only* outlet reporting a story. Everyone's got to get a start somewhere, but that's not our concern. \n\nWe rightfully rail against the mainstream media, but there should be some level of reputation behind news we want to use to potentially convince fence-sitters of our positions. 
>did I screwed up somewhere?\n\nAbout 20 years ago.\n\n>My question here is what do I do now?\n\nNothing more.  You might have handled the situation indelicately but you got your point across and that's what's important.  Ellie will come around.  She'll get a better job and he won't.  She'll be paying rent and he won't.  She'll clean the house and he won't.  That won't go on forever.\n\n>My question is do I have to apologize to her and what can/do I say to her?\n\nI'd apologize for your behavior but not your opinion, and don't push communication on her.  She's an adult and gets to make her own (bad) decisions, but she also gets to choose who she talks to.  And right now she's choosing to not talk with you.
Get him a few story books. He can enjoy them from a comfortable distance, or while cuddled up with his dad, while you read to him. \n\nReading times will get him to associate you with something good, and the books will end up a more interactive gift than toys.  You might be able to build a relationship where he comes to you asking to read. 
>Am I over reacting\n\nYes.  You have a fragile ego.   Your wife has learned over years of knowing you she'd rather throw a board game than deal with your reaction to losing.  She saw a temper tantrum coming on and averted a ruined evening.  You should be thanking her.
Thanks for the write up.\n\nI was having trouble in mu4e where some messages show up with the body completely blank.  Turns out it was HTML messages where the sending mail client would include a plaintext part which was simply blank.   Setting (setq mu4e-view-prefer-html t)  resolved this (but now I see more html styled emails, unfortunately)\n\nI use mbsync (aka isync  https://sourceforge.net/p/isync/isync/ci/master/tree/ ), built from source, instead of offlineimap.  Offlineimap was having issues with my office exchange server UID validity http://www.offlineimap.org/doc/FAQ.html#what-is-the-uid-validity-problem-for-folder   After clearing my cache for the nth time I switched over and haven't had a problems since.\n\nI don't run mu index outside mu4e.   I have the following settings and mu4e handles the syncing for me, so i don't worry about mu running in the background.\n\n(setq mu4e-get-mail-command "/usr/local/bin/mbsync -aq")\n(setq mu4e-update-interval 300)\n\nand for mbsync in particular I set: (setq mu4e-change-filenames-when-moving t) which the documentation says works better for mbsync, while the default is better for offlineimap.  The version of mbsync in ubuntu didn't understand some configuration directives I was trying to use, but it might work for you.\n\nYou also should enable (setq mu4e-compose-format-flowed t)  so your plaintext emails wrap nicely in other clients.  Check out the reasoning https://mathiasbynens.be/notes/gmail-plain-text\n\n\nSome other settings I like:\n(setq mu4e-use-fancy-chars t)\n(setq mu4e-view-show-images t)\n(setq mu4e-view-show-addresses t)\n\n\n\n
Good news!  You got away.  Your hand will never betray you. 
Let her know before she confides something in you she wouldn't if she knew you were in the family.   \n\nMaybe she eloped?  Maybe she has a child?  Maybe she got divorced?  Maybe she won the lottery?   Maybe she lives nearby?  Maybe she's in contact with some family members, but it's secret from the rest of the family?  \n\nSomething as innocent as "My husband had to work late so my son stayed at his uncle's house." could be far more information in one sentence than she ever wants your husband to know.\n\n>I guess her loyalty to her mother goes beyond what's reasonable.\n\nDon't do  this.  You don't know what the story is.  You got one side from your husband.  For all you know he molested her.  Not saying he did, but you're judging her as unreasonable despite not having the slightest idea what happened.

Give it a week to settle down before doing something drastic like changing a phone number.\n\nI have common.name@popularemail.com   I've gotten correspondence from schools about other peoples' children, mortgage closing documents, private information about far too many families, and purchase agreements for 1,000+ unit orders from china (more than once!)\n\nGenerally, it comes in fits and starts.  Nothing for months and suddenly floods of emails trying to schedule a house closing with many financial documents attached, or a child who decided to skip school a bunch of days in a row.   \n\nDude probably entered a random phone number for a "free car" raffle or something and it got sold off as a lead to cold call.  It'll age out and the annoyance will dissipate.

I have never once discussed my sexual history with a woman before meeting her in person. That's really weird. Stop doing it. \n\nI've had girlfriends where the discussion was nothing more than acknowledging std testing\n\nWhy are you talking about sexual history before you even know if you can enjoy an entire date with that person?   Stop bringing it up.  The next time you get the impulse to talk about sexual history, instead ask if she wants to meet up for a date and get to know her in person.

The Obama family plans to stay in DC while their youngest finishes high school, which Obama personally announced in March 2016, long before anyone took the idea of President Trump seriously.  \n\nNot a single sentence in this article comes close to supporting the premise that Obama will interfere with the Trump presidency in a way that will fail "to emulate the class and deference shown him by President George W. Bush"
So, yes?
With that reaction time she'll never win a major. 
Crying itself isn't a problem.\n\nOn the other hand, debilitating crying at the drop of a hat seems like you're bubbling with anxiety, which you keep bottled up until it pours out any time you think about negativity.\n\nIt couldn't hurt to get some therapy and see if you have some issues you're suppressing creating anxiety (like the fact you've been mugged multiple times).
You definitely don't love her for who she is, but do you even like her as a person?\n\n\nI feel bad she's dating a guy who feels so judgemental about her. \n\nDoes she even know you're sterile or have you kept that a secret?  You sound like a huge jerk actually.   She gave you a place to live after you were rendered homeless (probably because your parents got tired of you being a huge jerk), and you don't even seem grateful. 
Thanks for this.  Your breadboard instructions are incredibly informative and concise.  \n\nI did a project using a C.H.I.P. (https://getchip.com/) and instead of using the pin headers I used electrical tape to connect a sensor to a usb->serial cable.   Had no idea where to start with a breadboard.\n\nThe CHIP is great because it runs full linux and has an integrated wifi chip.  For $9.
Momentum.\n\nI run chrome, terminals, and emacs.  XFCE let's me do that without me having to learn anything special, and there haven't been new "features" distracting from the core goals of letting me get work done.\n\nIf a new XFCE release started annoying me I'd spend an hour finding a replacement available in Ubuntu, that was good enough, and move on without a second thought.
I'd prefer being assassinated by poisoned needles over just normal needles, if given the choice.

No, what i'm assuming is the neighbor was sending out the financial report balance sheet for the HOA, which included members late on dues along with the remedy.\n\nProbably some boiler plate about placing a lien and forcing the house to be sold that triggered OP by hitting him right in the pride.
It's not a pet. Fixed that for you, you're welcome.
Were your HOA dues late?\n\nWas the pot luck down on the beach in the middle of winter?  And him borrowng your kayaks? Or that one time he sat in your lawn chair?  Or were these incidents from half a year ago?  Sounds like the community holds a potluck and you hid behind your curtains glowering at your neighbors having fun.\n\nWhy don't you have friends on the lake?   
The outdoor tour is honestly underwhelming.  A bunch of barren concrete pads.   The rocket garden is cool, and the capsules astronauts flew in are shockingly tiny.\n\nThen I saw the vehicle assembly building.  That was impressive and memorable but didn't make the day trip worth it.   The bus tour dropped us at a visitor center type building and we filed into a  movie theater and saw a 20 minute or so documentary about NASA and space which was meh.\n\nI stepped out of the theater directly under the engines of the Saturn V and almost cried.   Pictures can't capture the enormity and complexity of what humans built.  The sheer existence of such a thing pushes your understanding of reality.

>I don't believe that my brother is a bad person at heart.\n\nHe's a child rapist...\n\n>I really want to be there for her because I feel that growing up, I was always more focused on my own ambitions and career goals.\n\nYou could try being there for her by growing a spine and telling your parents your brother sexually assaulted your sister all through her childhood.  You "being there" for her isn't going to get her into therapy, or protect her from your predator brother.  \n\nYou keeping the secret only serves to protect your child raping brother while doing nothing to help your sister.\n\n

>I found a 19 page document\n\nIt isn't a "document"  It's his diary, that you found then read every page of.\n\n>He basically goes through and nitpicks every reaction I had to him and paints himself in a very good light.\n\nYou write this like he's saying this to other people.  These are his private thoughts you're reading (without his permission).  He's not making you out to be the bad person in front of his family at dinner, or trash talking you to your kid's teacher.  It's his personal diary.\n\n>I guess I just don't know what to do with this document now.\n\nYou could admit to him you read his diary and you want to apologize for being violating his privacy.  And you hope he can forgive you.  And that if he's still having those feelings you want to talk about them.\n\n>I can make an appointment\n\nYou might want to get on that.   \n\nYou should have stopped reading when you figured out what the "document" was, but you come here and still try to avoid admitting the invasion of his personal thoughts you committed.  I see elsewhere you say you weren't snooping.  Maybe not, while reading the first page, or even the second.  But by the 18th you were definitely snooping.
>What should I do?\n\nChill out and give her space.  See if you can have the kids stay somewhere else for a few days or more.  Give her lots of alone time.  Cook and clean while she grieves, but don't force your way into her space.  See how the situation changes.  Her father just slowly died in front of her.  \n\nYou probably do have relationship issues with her related to how you're watching someone else's kid, and allowing your ex- to get between you and your gf BUT those things can be dealt with in a week or a month.    Let the woman mourn.\n
Boiled chicken, steamed broccoli and white rice tonight and everything night going forward.\n\nWhy are you even bothering with this superficial question?

Ask him on a date.   "Confessing" dumps your emotional baggage on him and takes your relationship to 11.

He might not have put any thought into it.

They won't cut the subsidies directly.  They'll water down the bare minimum of what counts as health insurance back to the days of lifetime payout limits, completely absurd coverage limits (e.g. $50 *per pregnancy*), and unlimited yearly out of pocket expenses.  Once they allow insurance selling across state lines, the insurance companies will consolidate down to the state with the lowest protections and requirements, same as credit card companies.\n\nThis will lower the bottom tier insurance plans available in the marketplace, which will result in lower subsidies but people will have "insurance".  Healthy people will be very happy with the change, until they become sick people.

I can't imagine the difficulty serving as a diplomat under Trump.  How do you give a straight answer to anyone?  When does your own credibility suffer for representing such a fluid President?  His foreign policy and world view isn't even written in pencil.

Before they say something stupid?  too late for that.   I doubt your parents are fully accepting of your sister's sexuality or the fact she decided to adopt rather than have a biological grand child.\n\nYour parents will look for any reason to exclude the boy from your family.   That kid is your nephew.  Their grandson and your sister's son.  Best you can do is call them out for being shitty to someone in your family and support your sister when she has to protect her son from his hostile grandparents.

The data you cite does not seem to be compared against condoms. Which seem to be better alternative to cutting off part of the genitals of babies.

I want him to be good for his self and the Blazers but I think we've seen enough to know he won't be.
I'm imagining a council of judgemental trees secretly running the world from their mountain top lair.
For me, idealogically (spelling?) Pence is the worst. However, I am more concerned with the threat I honestly feel Trump poses to our nation from a constitutional perspective, as well as the potential for a foreign policy conflagration. For me, I am willing to endure the harm I think a Pence presidency would do because I think he has our nation's interest at heart and is a level headed person. I am seriously concerned about Trump. I am seriously concerned about the Republicans willingness to go along with him despite, what I feel, are major warning signs.
I'm a liberal. I would seriously rather have Pence. For too many reasons to list.
Well that's just like your opinion man... But your reply was a bit broader than my posting. I would say this is peaceful, also what sort of protest would you say is "respectful"?
Lol this is not a feral cat. A feral cat is a wild animal that will not let you touch or get near them.. You have a stray cat. Good on you for fostering though.
I'm going to ignore the topic of the article. This is a perfect example of something very wrong with how journalists or editorialists write about science. The article purports to describe the study conducted. Yet the author started with their own editorializing on the subject, "priming" the readership to feel one way about the subject. The author also fails to state that the journal which published the article is run by a conservative think tank. Based on the article it seems that the conclusions drawn by the authors rely entirely on what studies the authors deem "credible" yet there is no discussion about their selection process. This is just a horrible way to write about science. 
Take her to the 1st Ave shelter.
It may be cliche but probably the internet? Atheism/agnosticism had been so thoroughly defamed for thousands of years, often involving physical or political violence (association with red scare), that the underlying ideas behind atheism were not allowed to be spread or made available to the population. With greater access to these ideas people are adopting them in higher numbers. This rise may level off eventually, it may not. Certain demographics are more open to the adoption of new ideas which is why we see a lopsided demographic trend compared to a statistically even adoption across demographics.
Your perspective is one I do not understand. You are obviously intelligent and accept what the scientific process has shown us about electricity and engineering. You, better than most, appreciate the intricacies and hard work that goes into the development of your field. Yet you reject evolution. This boggles my mind. Evolution has been shown to be true by the same process of investigation that gives us your field. So I'm curious. I don't believe we'll have a meeting of the minds on this but why do you believe in creationism over evolution? Do you believe in a literal reading of the Bible?
Please keep posting this.  Recovery should be about empowerment not helplessness. 
You too, I always walk away smiling after a civil discussion online.
I think your point is correct. When considering fallacies I think the most important point is that those,  like myself who consider ourselves educated on the topic, are  just as susceptible as everyone else. On a broader topic I am also interested as to why, in the face of well reasoned arguments I am unable to cede you the point. I view it as a matter of my perception of my intrinsic self. I often make the point that a Christian born to a Christian nation would for instance be a Muslim if they were born into an Islamic country. Yet I will not agree that if I were born into a religious household I would be religious. This is influenced by the fact that the household I was born into was religious, but the principle remains the same. My household valued opposition and debate. Perhaps what I should take from this discussion is a greater empathy for those I disagree with.
You beat me to it. If you are a responsible pet owner you're looking at several hundred bucks to start. Whereas adopting at a shelter the adoption price is often well below that and you can be reasonably sure they are negative for leukemia. \nI hope OP considers giving them to a shelter or rescue.
Different strokes I guess
But also I cannot stress enough how pleasantly you have presented your arguments. Thank you for that.
Try to keep up. \nhttp://www.theguardian.com/environment/2010/jul/07/climate-emails-question-answer
Hell yes Fawlty Towers! That was my first thought when I read the misspelling. I watched the entire series about nine years ago. It's why I started paying some attention to British tv.
I'm a liberal who thinks Devos is the worst. To me this is the same as Wallace (I think that's who it was) standing in the door to prevent integration. It is a denial of federal authority and should be repudiated as such. Police should have been called to arrest these people. This to me is the worst thing an anti Trump person could do. It is a refusal to accept the rule of a democratically elected government. We cannot stand as a nation if we reject the rules of democracy. 
An anonymous person runs a poll and we are supposed to value the results? Williams is certainly in the wrong but we need to have some intellectual rigor.
Gypsies? Looks more like Friday night with the Palin household.
I think that while a teacher of any race or cultural background can teach the facts and controversies, a person who comes from a minority background probably has a better grasp of the intangible subtleties of the issues. However, to say someone is less qualified without knowing who the other applicants were is just stupid.
Did not read the article. But the headline is true on its face. Congress is super white! Any action they take can be blamed on white people
Greenhill no longer charges a fee and the fee was never a factor in declining an animal.
The report was published in "the new Atlantis" which is not a respected scientific journal. The new Atlantis is also run by a conservative think tank. This report just isn't credible.
I work at a shelter. We currently have a geriatric one eyed pug that sits like this. Absent any other signs, this is uncommon but normal behavior. 
It also means there isn't actually any arsenic in it.
Huh, thanks!
This
At the very least call Greenhill and file a found report so they have her on file and can cross check her on their lost reports and potentially locate an owner
I sit in the timbers army. If you toss anything other than streamers or confetti on the pitch you get tossed. Its easy to know who threw the thing because every other person is yelling and screaming at them to gtfo. Then they are escorted out. Ive seen it happen.
I inarticulately expressed a question in my reply to your reply. Assuming the medical benefits of circumcision obviously warrants the procedure, why do we not wait until an adult of fully developed brain make the decision for himself? Why would you force your decision (negating the bodily sovereignty of another human) onto a baby.
Doesn't sound like Trump to me. No wild accusations, no fear mongering. No crazy ideas that will never happen.
Seriously? Not even wearing medical gloves? Like wtf?
I appreciate the contrition expressed in acknowledging the misplacement of your post. But I must protest that most municipalities give bicyclists (when bicycle lanes are unavailable, and despite the actions of individuals,) the same legal right to the road as motorists.
Because people have individual differences and are not robots? People have different personalities and experiences. I'm having trouble separating your line of questioning/position from a basic question of "why are people different?". The answer is that they are. There is tons of data out there on why people leave the church and it is easily available. People are different and like/do different things for different reasons.
I'm a liberal and I subscribe to this sub to learn about opposing views. It seems to me that a department of education makes sense to standardize standards and practices for our country. I don't see a value in educational standards being peicemeal across the fifty states. Especially with how mobile our population has become. I think having a nationwide standard would benefit the public and businesses. It seems to me it would be a larger hassle for businesses to have to evaluate each states educational system when making hiring decisions or relocation decisions based on workers desire to live within a certain educational district. This line of reasoning certainly does not touch on the states rights issue. So I ask you to let me know your views in the interest of better understanding between citizens. Thank you.
I would be interested in reading the stats for  non-circumsized vs circumsized that you are obviously familiar with.  Often a %200 decrease in infection risk is overblown if the infection risk is actually about 1% yes I made up those numbers but the argument is sound. To the sti argument, condoms reduce the risk way more than circumcision without cutting off a part of the genitals. Basically we are talking about a procedure which in the context of modern medicine has negligible effects on anything and we are left with the reality that we are permanently altering the genitals of male babies without their consent. How is this not genital mutilation?
Seconded. They only need one exam a year and can sell you flea control and other parasitic controls at reduced prices. That being said, they are not a full service clinic. Think about signing up for Care Credit.
You are correct, Wheels is the play by play. He is the guy that is constantly talking. Harvey comes in for analysis
Acceptance of the genital mutilation of male children. 
My point was sincere, albeit rather flippant. Respect or lack of it is different for most people. I know at least one marine who does not find their protest disrespectful. Also, in my view, as Americans we are equal. No one group gets to be held sacrosanct against criticism or lifted above others as more deserving of a place or voice in our society. My original post dealt only with the athletes and their form of protest so I'm not sure why you are bringing up the actions of other people. But I am honestly curious about what a "respectful" protest, in your eyes would be. As far as speculating about these athlete's patriotism or willingness to fight for their country if attacked, I feel your criticism on that score is unjust.
I get your point and it is an important one. I also appreciate the historical context you are bringing into this. Without any evidence, my own opinion is that denying the absence of gods (especially those that intervene in human affairs) has usually been seen as dangerous. Perhaps you have evidence to rebut what I am about to propose (which is my own thinking absent any evidence). Unpopular opinions are always difficult to voice. When voicing that opinion may bring down the wrath of a supernaturally powerful being that may be even more the case. I do not think it is wrong to take the historical and modern reactions to atheism as a model for how it would have been received before historical documentation. What do you think of taking the historical response to atheism as a model for what may have happened in the past? Also yes, my hyperbolic statement of thousands of years deserved to be called out. I made it in haste without proper reflection.
Did anyone catch the anthem at the opening? that was some crazy nonsense.
Not sure if sarcastic.... At least in the US, it is often seen as polite and welcoming to ask your guest to say grace. Which can be super awkward and uncomfortable.
I have some serious misgivings with this article and the many objections to Kaepernick's actions. Number one "good americans fought/died for your rights now you are being ungrateful" so americans died for my rights and now I shouldn't use them? Number two Kaepernick is rich therefore he shouldn't complain about things. Seriously? Number three, a white family adopted him so he shouldn't complain about discrimination. For reals? I didn't know being adopted meant you got to switch your skin color. I'm not going to comment on the substance of what he is protesting because we can all disagree. The best argument I have heard against how he is protesting is that the anthem/flag and our respect for both is about fostering a sense of community. By not standing for the anthem Kaepernick is damaging that sense of community which we need as a country to come together to solve things. I disagree with this argument but I can respect it.
Because some are more open/susceptible. Some people are just uncomfortable taking things on faith. Some people look at the history of religion and don't want to be associated with it. Some people look at certain representations of "religious" values and are horrified. Invariably these people need to be primed in some way to be open to changing their views, or to admit what they have always felt in private. These groups tend to be marginalized and or young. Also more highly educated and therefore, usually, taught to question underlying assumptions and look at both sides of an issue, sometimes for the first time. As people age they become more set in their ways and less willing to question which is why we see the trend more among young people compared to older.
Thanks! I checked earlier and didn't see that.
The morning after pill works by preventing the fertilized egg from attaching to the uterine wall. It is not unusual for such an egg to not attach on its own.
Perhaps part of the issue here is an expectation that secret service officers do not share personal info of the people they protect. If this secret service officer were to be rewarded for "telling all" we would probably see legislation making what he is doing illegal.
Stray hold at the shelter is three days if there is no way to contact the owner if there are tags or some other identification, including a Craigslist post the hold is five days. During this time the dogs are advertised on the website and Craigslist.
This is the kind of response I think we should have to this. Ridiculous, stupid, dangerous, and/or offensive ideas are best fought by exposing them to the ridicule they deserve. Get the idea into the open and expose it as the nonsense it is and expose those spouting these ideas as the morons they are. Ad hominems aren't always fallacious but they should be used with care to have the best effect.
I dont have any advice for the winter. But there are a lot of rec sports leagues in town. You could look into that. If you are good at making friends out of strangers try level up arcade/bar. They have a weekly bingo night (free to play) on wednesdays or try shoryuken league (five dollar cover and all the console games you can play). You could also try volunteering someplace. The raptor center and greenhill humane society are always accepting volunteers. 
I would appreciate that, thank you. I think perhaps the weakest point in my argument of "thousand year atheism" (of course this is a hypothetical I (not necessarily originally) brought forth,) is that if I were in that era I as a "natural skeptic" would be an atheist or perhaps an agnostic. This belief of mine (lacking evidence) certainly inflates my ego. However, I cannot escape the idea that my contrarian nature (I assure you to my detriment this is not limited to religion​) would produce at least agnosticism. I'm not arguing against you as this discussion has pertained to general trends. I cede entirely the point pertaining to general populations. However, perhaps out of arrogance, I cannot cede the point of a " contrarian/agnostic/atheist" not existing during the time period you are referencing. I think perhaps I may be splitting hairs to the detriment of the discussion. I honestly cannot admit to myself that there would not be an idea of atheism/agnosticism. 
Yeah, except the picture is different you cunt.
I can not imagine this is in any way legal. I think this is a scam. No responsible rental company or landlord would put this responsibil on a tenant or have an old tenant interact in this way with a prospective tenant
Right, no medical downside. For me i just don't think it is moral to permanently, surgically alter someone's genitals without their consent.
I saw it too! I just logged in to figure out what it was!
Of course! I was just giving myself a laugh. As a shelter worker, I want to thank you for "rescuing" whichever form that took.
Are the stairs in question the ones by the rock climbing wall?
I just want to say that I found this article extremely well-written. While avoiding the topic at issue, the author was self-deprecating he expressed his opponents viewpoints expressed a genuine desire to understand people and included some wit so good to him well done
Right, I "feel" that the choice to have permanent surgical unnecessary medical procedure should only be made by the person undergoing surgery.
You really think you can argue against this action by comparing women's health to that of non human animals? I'm not arguing against your stance on animal rights but Jesus Christ have some situational awareness.  Also I have never understood why FGM gets more awareness than MGM. Circumcision is the same thing (in principle). All of the medical benefits of circumcision are ridiculously miniscule when compared to the benefits of education and condoms. The arguments for circumcision from a medical perspective rest on an assumption that men cannot make medical decisions for themselves. Cutting a person's genitals is the same regardless of sex.\n
Would you be so kind as to direct me to some readings where I might learn more on this? Honestly I'm not arguing for sources I just haven't read anything on historical atheism. Bravo for your response. I hope it gets the upvotes it deserves. You certainly have mine.
Number 1, Greenhill and 1st Ave are the same organization. Number 2, you can take stray dogs to 1st Ave on closed days, number 3, the nonsense spewed by No Kill Lane County is utter bullshit
For clarity I'm a liberal but mainly just lurk to keep an ear out for what the other side is thinking. I'm not subscribed to any liberal/Democratic subreddit except for r/politics. I haven't commented in a long time, but it seems like there aren't a lot of true scotsmen left in this sub anymore.
I know what you mean. The blazers keep doing this. I feel bad for a team like the clippers. They played without Barnes, Crawford, and Griffin and had the blazers in control until the final couple of minutes of regulation. It would be different if this was a one off but the blazers keep coming back from ten plus point deficits in the fourth quarter. It seems almost in poor taste.
Right, I am aware of the disparity in health outcomes, but surely the principle should be as strongly held regardless of sex.
I don't see any reason listed for sale. All you've posted is an image of someone selling puppies which is entirely legal and uncontroversial.
Thank you for sharing. I attempted and took specific steps to prevent any possible interventions from my friends and roommates. I still wake up some nights panicking over what would have happened to them  if it worked.
This specific conflict started when three israelis were kidnapped and killed. Then in retaliation a palestinian kid was kidnapped and burned alive. A palestinian faction then started firing rockets into israeli controlled territory and israel started firing back. So far israel has killed over sixty people including unarmed civilians. The palestinian faction although sincere in their efforts to kill civilians as well as military targets has managed zero kills due to their rudimentary rockets. While it is true israel is under attack it is much like two people on either sides of a river. On one side a midget throws a grenade halfway across. On the other side a trained militarily person throws a grenade past the midget and into a suburban development.
I think you're right. He coaches his team very well, and without drama. His players play team ball and even though they've had huge stars they don't play hero ball. Sometimes he has a temper but passion is a good thing. He also calls his team and players out in public and private when he feels they aren't performing.
Except it is permanent alteration of the genitals without consent. They have that in common.
I'm not convinced yet that non surgical abortions (abortions via pill). Need the same standard as the outpatient surgical center where my arm was put back together with multiple plates and screws. Also, waiting periods? Mandatory sonograms? ( I know you didn't bring them up) I'm fairly convinced that the "safety issue" can be handled by the doctors involved. As I understand it abortion (for the mother) is extremely safe and the upgrades to abortion providing centers are a solution in need of a problem.

I appreciate the response. But I find in it's contents a complete lack of understanding of how this affects the whole community. As I am too lazy to explain this and don't wish to resort to invectives, I give up.
Never thought I'd have to try so hard to convince strangers my asshole is bleeding. 
None of this is about protesting the anthem. They are protesting the treatment of African Americans in America. The form of the protest is kneeling during the anthem.
I had no idea they made those. I kind of want one.
This picture made the rounds a few years ago. As I remember this was during a singing of the national anthem. Only during the pledge of allegiance is it customary to put your hand over your heart. Although most people have started to do it for both.
If you're interested in why people feel the need to do so. Visit what'stheharm.net, these fake medical practices have no benefit beyond placebo, often cost quite a bit, and have serious risks.
I totally agree with the anti/unsafe voting machine sentiment. I just wanted to say (since I haven't seen it mentioned yet) that the machines/rules for voting are determined/controlled by the individual states. 
Yeah, it was barely even a dog whistle, more like a fog horn
I get to bring him to work! I work at a shelter, which is where I got him. He basically has the run of the place.
Feral refers to socialization level. Cats have a short socialization window. They can only be socialized to people until about eight or ten weeks. A feral cat is a wild animal that cannot be tamed or socialized. A kitten born to a feral in the wild could be socialized to not be feral. Although this would require removing the kitten from the mother and bottle feeding it which can reduce the chance of the kitten surviving into adulthood.
So you admit that condom use makes the benefits of circumcision negligible? Your argument seems to be that circumcision is ok since Africans can't be trusted to use condoms therefore we should cut off parts of their genitals. Alongside your argument of "some guys won't use condoms therefore we should cut off a peice of all male genitals?
My reaction right here
I never saw this! How did this not blow up and reach me underneath the rock that I live under?
Agreed
This mistake irritates me soo much. I work in animal care and the difference of services I can offer a stray vs a feral is huge. I just don't listen to people when they use labels anymore.
Except that states are passing unnecessary regulations that are designed to shutter clinics. The Texas case is a perfect example.
No way man, stay with us forever. The world needs more people like you spreading positive vibes. Keep doing what you're doing.
So good, the disappointment in that guys voice makes me happy, only because I and everyone else here knows it all to well.  
Even if the pipeline were being built on the reservation, they would not be breaking the treaty of 1868.\n\nARTICLE XI.\nIn consideration of the advantages and benefits conferred by this treaty and the many pledges of friendship by the United States, the tribes who are parties to this agreement hereby stipulate that they will relinquish all right to occupy permanently the territory outside\n\ntheir reservations as herein defined, but yet reserve the right to hunt on any lands north of North Platte, and on the Republican Fork of the Smoky Hill river, so long as the buffalo may range thereon in such numbers as to justify the chase. And they, the said Indians, further expressly agree:\n\n1st. That they will withdraw all opposition to the construction of the railroads now being built on the plains.\n\n2d. That they will permit the peaceful construction of any railroad not passing over their reservation as herein defined.\n\n3d. That they will not attack any persons at home, or travelling, nor molest or disturb any wagon trains, coaches, mules, or cattle belonging to the people of the United S\n\ntates, or to persons friendly therewith.\n\n4th. They will never capture, or carry off from the settlements, white women or children.\n\n5th. They will never kill or scalp white men, nor attempt to do them harm.\n\n6th. They withdraw all pretence of opposition to the construction of the railroad now being built along the Platte river and westward to the Pacific ocean, and they will not in future object to the construction of railroads, wagon roads, mail stations, **or other works of utility or necessity, which may be ordered or permitted by the laws of the United States.** But should such roads or other works be constructed on the lands of their reservation, the government will pay the tribe whatever amount of damage may be assessed by three disinterested commissioners to be appointed by the President for that purpose, one of the said commissioners to be a chief or headman of the tribe.\n\n7th. They agree to withdraw all opposition to the military posts or roads now established south of the North Platte river, or that may be established, not in violation of treaties heretofore made or hereafter to be made with any of the Indian tribes.

Dang, I probably missed my chance, but I'll give it a shot. \n\nI just bought a house and closed at a fixed 30 year 3.52% rate. It looks as though interest rates will go up soon, but how does the housing market look under a Trump trajectory? Another possible collapse in 5 years or less? 
That's a really long way to say, \n\n"No, I don't have any proof that pedophilia is normalized in gay culture. But look at rates of homelessness, drug addiction, etc among young gay men and transfer those figures to pedophilia. You just can't see how obvious this all is from atop your liberal ivory towers."
We mistakenly thought better of republicans throughout the primary process. We won't make that mistake again. 
As a liberal, I always thought Bush was a decent human, though we'd agree on very little politically. Trump has somehow made me nostalgic for W... and that's insane. 
So they all left when Hillary took the stage, eh? Oh, they didn't. \n\nIt's ok, buddy. Keep counting yard signs
Ok. And Abraham Lincoln was a Republican, yet republicans today are busy flying confederate flags and referring to the Civil War as the war of northern aggression
So they aren't vetted currently? That's your argument? \n\nOr are you waiting on *extreme* vetting?
The mine in paradise valley does not exist presently. They want to begin the process. \n\nBut, given the location, even traditionally pro-mining Montanans are opposed to this. There's a big local movement that wants to stop this if things go forward under Trump

The "common sense brigade" is, I believe, how they like to envision themselves. They see no value in book smarts because they have none and look down on anyone who does because -to them- it means they can't function outside of a library. And they're proud of their ignorance. \n\nI've had this discussion so many times that I no longer pull any punches in the discussion. It is infuriating at this point. 
I think you're giving the debates a lot more weight than they deserve. Clinton had name recognition in spades. Millions were set to vote for her before she even announced her candidacy (which everyone knew was coming).\n\nAn idealistic old man captured the hearts of millions (mine included), however, and gave the presumptive shoe-in a run for her money. \n\nWe pushed hillary left, emboldened Sanders in the Senate, and showed the country there is a hunger for those liberal policies. Honestly, not bad for a Longshot candidate from Vermont. 
You can only run an email headline so many times
Fingers crossed it was sarcasm. Compared to standing in line for hours on end, this seems perfect. 
They're still large voting blocs in states that are especially important to Trump: Colorado, Nevada, Arizona, Florida 
Because exit polling there wasn't anomalous. She's not doing this for Hillary, she's doing this for herself. 
Ok. EVs aren't dictated by ruled landmass, so that's irrelevant. 
Sorry, I was thinking mail-in ballots. You are correct.

This sub has been liberal forever. The demographics of reddit make it so. \n\nThe difference here is you can have an opposing viewpoint and not be immediately banned. Sure, you'll probably get downvoted or illicit opposing responses, but you won't be banned. Unless, of course, you just start lobbing insults at people you disagree with. \n\nT_d, on the other hand, you cannot have an opposing viewpoint. All praise be to Trump at all times. Anything less -banned

Everything I've seen has shown republicans with a higher turnout than democrats in Florida, but by less than in 2012... which wouldn't be good news for republicans. 
We don't care
From my perspective, they shut themselves in conservative echo chambers and share that drivel via social media. Hell, as of recently, the narrative that fox news is liberal has gained momentum in their circles. They're not interested in hearing the other side, if the news doesn't confirm their bias, it's not real news.

Yes and no. The access hollywood tape came out before a weekend and then continued to dominate the following week. But there were also debates and so on in the midst of all this with plenty of new reporting to do. \n\nIf Hillary's campaign or some other sources have a major oppo dump, I would've thought we'd seen it by now. My guess is there's not much there OR they have absolute nerves of steel. 
I can't even tell what's joke or reality anymore
For that to make sense, you'd have to assume Hillary stands to win Utah. Near as I can tell, dems breaking for McMullin takes Utah away from Trump
Said the guy who posts regularly in the_Donald
It was tightening before the Comey announcement. The entire week leading up to it was relatively quiet from Trump. When he isn't attempting to fit both feet in his mouth or saying something awful, his polls steadily rise. 
Democrats' ability to snatch defeat from the jaws of victory doesn't leave me very optimistic... especially in off year elections
Considering that country is currently run by kgb operatives from that Era...
Wait for DC
Another (more honest) way to phrase this would be to say the national debt doubled under GWB. Coincidentally, it also doubled under Obama. That being said, the deficit had shrunk under Obama, so the debt isn't as high as it would have otherwise been. \n\nJust in case you're interested in the nuances of "but muh national debt"

Idk how many times I've read this. Nate Silver's primary models were just fine. They CORRECTLY PREDICTED TRUMP WINS. Evidently, he thought better of the electorate and ASSUMED Trump would eventually die off so a real candidate could get the nomination. On that front, he was wrong.

Joseph and Kazuma definitely have things in common.
I've liked Abe since the mutual defense thing.\n\nBasically Abe wanted to reinterpret the constitution(which is a thing you can do in Japan) to allow for Japan to come to the aid of an ally if they were attacked. (so basically just to come to the aid of the usa) At the time, it was terribly unpopular and Abe was going to push through with it anyway, because his grandfather who was a pm was kicked out of office for the first reinterpretation, allowing for self defense. Simply because it was what he thought was the right thing to do. \n\nThat's loads of integrity for a politician.

The two things you have put forward don't logically follow. \n\n1) The order to put people in camps was an order\n\n2) Trump is also issuing executive orders\n\nAt this point, you haven't lost me, we're in agreement.\n\n3) therefore, this could happen again\n\nHere is where you lose the way. The claim is in no way related to the two things you've issued. What you really need to establish is A) a bridge about how Trump's executive orders are comparable to an order interning American citizens, and B) how this would be somehow desired or allowed by the courts today (notice how Trump's executive order, which is not even close to interning American civilians, has already been stopped by the courts)\n\nIn short, you've skipped over making your argument completely, just assuming that two things that aren't necessarily related are. Your point may be accurate, but your logic isn't even on the table for me to look at. 
Let's say someone is making a claim, A is true therefore B is true, and I agree with B being true. However, I don't see at all any connection between A and B, and I don't think it's fair or makes any sense to correlate the two. If I just let it go saying 'well as long as you come to the conclusion B is true, that's fine.' then I'm saying I don't care about being critical and reasonable, I only care about people agreeing with me.\n\nIn fact, in my opinion the opposite is true. I couldn't care less if someone agrees with me as long as they think critically. A kind of conformist mob consensus is a really dangerous thing.\n\nReally I was being a snarky jerk about it, but the post set me off as being really obviously wrong, so I wanted to bite back.

I literally went to public school, literally paid 2.50 for papa John's pizza slices being sold on campus. (there was the Fucking box right there, they ordered the pizza from papa johns and sold slices at 100% markup) Just like with this kid in the story, the school also sold disani water and little cookies that you could buy *for half the price* at the 7/11 across the street. Exactly the same brand. No extra 'quality control' to make sure it's not poisonous, because the 7/11 is also required by law not to poison it's customers.\n\nThe other school meals weren't from nationwide chains, but they also were the equivalent of microwave meals warm-up and sell. In the food industry, labor and then rent costs are the two biggest expenses, actually buying food is pretty cheap for a business who does it regularly and in bulk.\n\nWhat... what school did you go too that made its own food from scratch? \n\nAs ro your main point that they pay more to make it safer, man, do you think the food your kid eats outside the school at every other place is unsafe? I'm telling you, the school is marking up the food it sells 150% after getting discounts buying in bulk.

你会说普通话吗？\n\nAs for your actual positions, I think we're practically in agreement. The reason your comment set me off is that I 100% do not believe that Americans would make the mistakes of internment again, and our court system along with demonstrations (which I would take part in) would block it. I even really doubt Trump wants it either.\n\nIt was an absolute travesty of justice to happen the first time, so I want a little more thought put into saying that we haven't learned our lesson. The specific parts of the travel ban I had issue with (and you too, for good reason) are being taken out even when they have a good argument for being legal, if not ethical. The totally unethical and illegal internment of Americans is >far away< right now, and you and me will keep it that way.\n\nAs I'm sure you know, Americans only have the country binding them together, we have no other point of agreement, religion, ideology skin color etc., so I am very sensitive to condemnations of my country. 
TIL Buying the same brands of waterbottle from the supermarket my kid gets from school will kill me!\n\nWhat world are you living in where it's legal to sell stuff like that and it's going to kill you?\n\nIf you've ever actually gone to a public school, to a sporting event, etc. you know that is exactly why the are charging what they are. Even if they were making extra sure that these particular foodstuffs were safe (they're not, just papa-johns but with individual slices being sold for 1/4 the whole cost of the box, it wasn't so long ago I was in school) they could still just sell it for the same prices those foods go for outside the school! They charge these prices for the same reason every monopolist overcharges, because they can. They have a little captive consumerbase and can charge higher prices to pay for more pencils or whatever they want.

If the cop is from Hong Kong I would watch this. 
I'm totally okay with president making an ass of himself dealing with the media, as long as the rights of the press are respected, -regardless of rhetoric- it'll be fine.\n\nAs for how Trump runs his administration, yeah it's pretty crazy, not much to add there except that it'll be hard for him to 'accomplish' much given the dissent he's going to run into from all around.\n\nAs for being prepared to resist, I'm certainly ready.\n\nI would just add the supreme court justice being replaced is Antonin Scalia, so Neil Gorsuch is unlikely to really shake things up, and he seems okay.

"75 mph speed" is a type of stimulant that some members of the Michigan senate are taking to help them limit the efforts of senators looking to increase the state sales tax, who are referred to as "hike motors".

I was very surprised to see Last Week Tonight there. I'm surprised the rating for that show hasn't been brigaded by people who feel he pushes liberal propaganda.
Well this was over 6 years ago, so he's put out 2 albums since then.

Yeah, that guy has to have some ulterior motives in order to say such a thing. The Osprey is a failure whose only chance at redemption is to be the precursor to the V-280, but the V-280 may be dead in the water given the failures of the Osprey.
Nah, too similar to IndyCar.

Yeah, really, just let me do the lane switching; you can stay right there doing 65 in the left lane.
I'm pretty sure his citizenship requests can be denied on those grounds alone. 
Dumpster fire? The only issue is the obstruction. So, what, the liberals would play nice with Pence because what? He says fewer inflammatory things? The pressure on Pence to uphold Trump's campaign promises would be immense, because that's what the country voted for, and a true departure from his agenda would spur the creation of a Trump-based third major party.

Oh, V40, forgot those exist, my bad.
Yeah, this comes off as pretty disrespectful, to be honest. Charles Oakley is a Knicks legend. With the Knicks, He did all the little things, He made all the hustle plays. He essentially does everything today's Knicks don't do. What are the Knicks scared of? That if He gets close enough to the court, the players may learn a thing or two about defense? I mean, c'mon OP, all you have to do is put "Knicks Legend" before His name, not that difficult.

I'd actually consider a Sienna, but I don't know why it's so slow despite the 296 HP. And you can't get the sport-tuned suspension (SE) in AWD.\n\nI'm probably going to end up getting the GS, and I'll just have to chop the legs off one of my friends.
I don't see much tread on that tire
I feel it fits. There were some awkward moments, like the people looking stupid in the beginning trying to hit as low of a note as possible, and then the moment he goes into the imperceptible range..it was a bit of a let down, and based on the lead up, we didn't know if this was just a snake oil guy. And 1:46..."I sang with an A cappella group...um...back in...well, a few years ago."

Oh, I was thinking people would prefer hairless dogs as bedwarmers because there wouldn't be any hair coming off onto your blanket, but this explanation seems more likely.
I think the AWD only does 0-60 in 6.8 seconds. It's quite a bit heavier than the RWD.

I don't really know much about him but a few weeks ago iirc he out hustled the opposition (I forget which team) to a loose ball that he had no right to and earned my respect with that play. Problem with players like that though is that they play with a lot of purity, that means they are loathe to overact or draw attention to being fouled because it's not how they play the game. They trust the ref is going to their damn job and call it. That stat pisses me off. He shouldn't have to whine to the ref but it looks like that's the only way they'll do anything about it.\n\nEdit: a word
Don't want to take the "average age of revolving accounts" hit to my credit score.

But the Q7 and F-Pace are different classes, and the F-Pace is redundant with the SQ5. So you don't need a third row?
Really unfortunate that the generation of good-looking RAV4s isn't also a generation of fast RAV4s. Just put the V6 in it, c'mon, how complicated could that have been.\n\nAnd the Q5 is a solid member of the no-legs-allowed club. Stunning what they can do with a tune, though.

That's a compound helicopter.

I think I'd really enjoy an Outback if they made a 300 HP version with no CVT. I can't believe they force the 3.6R people to use the CVT...wouldn't anyone who wants more power not want a CVT?
Is that a T6? If so, how do you like it?
Yeah, Wonderboy was overly conservative in the first fight. I think he was either concerned about Woodley's power (which he felt and made it through), or he was thinking too much about the importance of the fight.

That isn't the point. OP just used IQ because that's the standard way of measuring "intelligence". If he phrased it, "You can sell 0.7% to 1.3% of your total intelligence for $500,000..." this thread would go nowhere.

AnCap is about reducing the levels of government (as a pragmatic way) and preventing the building of further layers. Taking down the EU will do that. 
Finally Issac Arthur is getting the recognition he deserves. 
Lefties really want Sessions gone because they he'all destroy them.  So they want to remove him though dishonest means.
What's being covered up?
He's was hired to go after Illegals, no one here gets that. If they and their children get voting rights, say good bye to any sense of Libertarianism. 
Globalism is a world government or aims for one.

It changes things for the poor now they have competition . Besides if someone masses so much wealth and power what is he going to do? He can't be in a permanent position of power. Shoot anyone that opposes him? If the US army can't hold Afghanistan, how could any rich person hold a significant amount of land. There still would be courts police just privitized. \n\nPeople who wage war in communities would be Physically Removed from society. Even if said warlord won, they can't hold a population long. However it needs a strong culture of Liberty to work.
Well they're wrong objectively, Pot Smokers are socialists with and without pot. In fact if were legalized, it would drop energy from the left as they have one less rallying issue that is universally accepted. Legalizing pot would help the fight against future socialists. 
So Sessions met for a non campaign story. Sorry you're not removing Sessions. He's going to be the AG and fake news can't stop it.

The Meteor that hit the Dinosaurs was an object that was traveling at 50km/s and had it's size in the GigaTons (Billions of Tons).

As for hurting Buildings, we can do that right now, just drop rods or accelerate them to 50km/s and you could take out a sky scraper but the US military defense system could intercept it.
Hillary did lie and I still maintain she should have been given a life sentence in Gitmo as a minimum. Sessions had done no such things, and has clarified what has happened. Better find new tinfoil.
They have showed that because they never had the opportunity to do so. The general trend is that larger states get opressive, and harder to leave. If said global state adopts socialism we have no where to run without getting gunned down. Look at the UN they're already pushing left wing ideas, and gave a platform to left wing authotarians. Also if said globalist government is a democracy say good bye to your freedoms, you have billions of people that will vote against Liberty. The US worked due to similar culture. Look at the EU now, there's slightly more separation in culture than the US states and it's already falling apart. You have the Chinese that could enough Democratic power as Europe. \n
Lol they think they banned the backup.

Anarchy with capitalism is the only non-thuggery Anarchism. Check out /r/Anarcho_Capitalism on resources how a society works.

That would need to be done on a different level such as supporting the republican sponsored bill to legalize pot. Work against CaF, using a bill. Don't put the responsibility on the AG not to enforce the law that is on paper. Sessions wasn't picked for weed or CAF and the the task he was picked for is way too important. He was picked for his stance on Illegals.
Adding to /u/TITANUPMAN , it's not because of "republican racism" or even race related. Turns out when you have poor Illegals getting amnesty, they will vote Democrat because more Democrats support more welfare state. Ronald Regan tried to get them to vote Republican by offering them amnesty. It failed and turned California Blue permanently.\n
And leave the US shitcanned by Illegals and Pedos. If you want legalization do it the proper way rather than ask someone not to enforce the law.
Yes, Businessess have the freedom of association. 
FYI, Charles Murray was an author of the Bell Curve which is a controversial  book arguring differences in IQ between Races. \n\nSo listening to an arguement makes you a Nazi now even if you disagree with the material. The left wants to hurt anyone that isn't subscribed to their world view.
That's why I'm not a fan of race based Immigration. Lumping all Hispanics does us a disservice. By those stats, a large amount of those 30% republican voters are Cubans and the rest are poorer people from other countries. In reality Illegals we give amnesty will vote Democrat over 95% while Cubans may vote Republican 65%+. \n\nGeopolitics change and nationality shouldn't be a permanent criteria for Immigration. If we make hating socialism, not having a Women studies degree, not having a membership of left wing parties in certain countries, a requirement to immigrate, it will at least maintain or improve America social core.
That too, Obama, his administration and the Clintons all deserve a life sentence at Gitmo.
That's because it has yet to have the power to do more damage than a nation state and they're working on it. They're trying to get a EU army, bullying Britain for leaving. You want power at the lowest and voluntary level ie. The individual.

Your lack of understanding of Heinlein's work is obnoxious.  You've obviously never really read up on the man. \n\nThe reason "hippies" made pilgrimages to see Heinlein was because of his novel Stranger in a Strange Land. A novel that put forth the virtues of communal living and free love, where the group shares everything equally and there are no possessions. \n\nYou see he was the Grandmaster of science fiction and was capable of masterfully writing a variety of viewpoints and world views. He kept his own views pretty quiet, although he was outspokenly anti-communism. \n\nYou should read Grumbles from the Grave if you want to truly understand the man. And you should read some actual literary criticism of Starship Troopers to learn it is not and never was intended to be pro-facist. It's about the duties of citizenship and what it means to serve your country. \n\nBut you won't do either, you'll stay ignorant and try to spread your ignorance wherever you can.

It's a system to register where he lives, and his is "nowhere."
So, you're misunderstanding what the term "life" is being used to denote. A cell is a living thing. That is easily provable. A fetus at its beginning is alive in a scientific sense, there is not and never has been a debate about that, it's biology 101. When the term "life" is used it is to denote a more intangible quality of "humanness" or at what point does that organism become an actual human and not the biological precursor. Much of that centers around sentience, or when there is a mind at work.  The argument is that too early on in development, a fetus, while composed of living biological material, has not yet formed into a sentient human. 
Ok, I hear that factory worker claim a lot.  I am the child of a factory worker, my dad worked for Hoovers.  I grew up about 5 blocks from the Timken steel factory and about 8 blocks from the Ashland Oil Refinery.  I lived around and knew factory workers and their families.  The ones who were smart and limited their vices were able to provide for their families.  Many, many factory worker's could not provide and did not provide for their families.  Factory work was not a way into to middle class in the vast majority of instances.  \n\nIf people were willing to live like the smart factory workers did they could thrive too.  We had a rotary phone my entire childhood (for those that don't know, push-button phone service cost more.)  We didn't use long distance because it cost more.  We had one phone bill and it was around thirty dollars.  We had no premium channels, only basic cable (which we didn't get until '82).  My mom bought almost all generic food brands.  There was no internet, so there's that cost.  We only ate out at lower-end restaurant's very rarely.\n\nCompare that to the average person's costs today.  Cellphone 100+ a month--and you buy a new one every couple of years for a couple hundred.  Cable+Internet+Netflix+Amazon+Hulu.  Starbuck's regularly, Chipotle regularly, organic food--'cause it's healthier. \n\nWe spend more than they did back then by far. 
C'mon, you're not the type who punches people in real life.  Don't get me wrong, Nazi's deserve it, but you won't be doing it.

True, just like not all priests are pedophiles.  But, after hundreds and thousands of cases, it's time to start taking a serious look at the religion that is producing these pedophiles, covering up their disgusting crimes, and relocating them to places where many times they reoffend.  In fact, after so very many cases, and the fact that thousands of priests who have committed pedophilia are still actively working within a church that knows they are pedophiles, it's probably time to stop listening to what the man who leads that religion says.

That tired platitude is simply not true.  Republicans opposing slavery is not the same as Dems using social welfare programs to keep many black and minority citizens stuck in a cycle of poverty that forces them to be dependent upon their democrat representatives maintaining said social welfare programs.\n\nDemocrats are not, and have never been "good" for minorities.  They have ruined city after city all while blaming corporate or Republican bogeymen, when their true goal is a self-maintaining voter base.  They want power and money, not to raise people out of poverty.\n\nThink for half a second: If a major voting block that you count on votes for you because of being poor, and statistically the more of that voting block that exits poverty the fewer that still vote for your side, what possible incentive do you have to actually attempt to see them raise out of poverty?  
Look up shiksa. \n
You mean the Nation of Islam?  We let them speak already.
Don't victim blame\n
It's almost as if he's intelligent to know that the world's not burning down and hysteria over the new president just feels good to a giant segment of the population who didn't vote, but want their way anyway. 
Couldn't get into the first season.  Didn't like one or two of the characters.  Felt like it had potential but wasn't living up to it.\n\nKeep meaning to try it again, but really didn't like first season.
Don't know where you went to boot camp, but I went to Parris Island. 
I love that both sides are using snowflake now. 
Man, I'll even give them that if they want. Ok so your beliefs are not mine, whatever. But, c'mon, we all agreed to no kid fucking, right?  So if he doesn't kick out the kid fuckers then he's a shit person.\n\nLike I manage a restaurant, and I actually had a guy who worked for me turn out to be molesting his kid. If I helped him sneak away and got him a job at another restaurant in the same chain, not only would I be a shitty human being, I'd be charged with a crime. 
He throws festivals, idiot. He provides venues for people who enjoy taking drugs to go to a safe place to take them and enjoy music, you warthog-faced buffoon. This is his target audience, you stupid, stupid fool.  Either you are against this, in which case, fuck you prude--or you are in a hurry to be offended on someone else's behalf, in which case, fuck you with a bag of...ah forget it, you zoned out a while ago.

Post written by someone who hasn't sacrificed one day of his life in service to his country. You know nothing about those of us who put our life on the line, so take your agenda and go back to r/politics. 
That is so far from true. Murder of a sentient human is illegal. The debate is at what point is a fetus a sentient human. Your framing is intentionally obtuse. 
What a coincidence.
Why not have the main character be a gay, transgender, multi-racial person who is offended by stuff?
I think mixing up the Summers family timeline can be excused.
No, if I were to mention that the USMC trained the sniper who killed JFK, I don't assume the responsibility of educating you on a matter of fact that is well known and documented. Your deficit of knowledge is your own flaw, not my responsibility. \n\nBut, fuck it, here:\n\nhttps://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.cnn.com/cnn/2015/02/17/opinion/ali-malcolm-x-assassination-anniversary/index.html\n\nhttp://www.cbsnews.com/news/farrakhan-admission-on-malcolm-x/\n\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malcolm_X\n\nBut, c'mon, you're not going to read any of this. \n\nAnyway, I'm done. 
He hit the ground running and despite 24/7 attempts by a partisan media (who several times during the campaign had mainstream journalists talk in interviews about how they had a moral responsibility to oppose Trump, even if it meant under reporting or not reporting on negative Hillary stories) he is doing just what he promised he would.  \n\nI've never seen a president who stuck to his campaign promises so sincerely.
Maybe Yachting?
Awesome. \n\nSaid nobody.
If it was Clinton you know the reason was hilarious. 
Read the original poem. The point is exactly the opposite. \n\nBy the way, I support the border wall, but I hate people quoting Frost when they don't know the point of the poem. 
Yeah, hundreds of known pedophile priests are still active clergymen, the Pope knows this and does nothing. But hey, he says hip things, and speaks out against Donald Trump so...that's ok?
The constitution already prevents it.\n\nThe ban is on countries that are predominately muslim, but is not a ban on muslims.\n\n
http://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/23/us/politics/23fox.html\n\nThere you go, the NY Times, read the fucking article, the white house calls FOX not a legitimate news organization, claims they're not news but more like talk radio, and then attempts to ban them from a pay czar interview.  \n\nJust take a second and actually read.\n\nEDIT: So I post an article from a left leaning newspaper detailing things that the last President actually said and did and the downvotes flow because people want Trump to be the first to have done this. Echo-chamber much?
I'm not going to get into it with you, but look it up.  I'm not being partisan, I'm against what Trump did, but Obama did goofy anti-FOX stuff too and the media stood together against it.
Right. Wait long enough and you will. But she won't look like that. 
Thumbnail was very deceptive.  
The literal sense of the word means slowed. You are referring to it in the medical sense, as part of the label mentally retarded, or mentally slowed. Using it by itself to mean mentally retarded would be slang. \n\nSo to sum up, no you are not. 
Yeah, how would you know?
And that's probably got to do with your high school being more middle class. We actually had two high schools, and one was solely for technical school training. \n\nI don't know if I'd get rid of majors that don't prepare for a career, education for education's sake and all that. But I would be for not allowing government loans or student aid to go to majors that do not have a record of producing jobs that earn more than the cost of the schooling. It's just a bad investment. 
There are no Republican states of Democratic states, there are states where the majority voted one way or the other.  But that doesn't mean that the welfare programs in states that vote majority Republican are Republican programs.  Nor does it negate my point at all.  Just because we have more white people in this country and those that are poor fall into the same traps as minority communities in many situations, it doesn't excuse the fact that the way our welfare system is set up is negative towards minorities and encourages multi-generational dependence.  \n\nIt builds in a culture of dependency and poverty.  It also does this to many poor whites, but my post was a response to the tired assertion that somehow the two parties have switched their values.\n\nAnd by the way, just to throw all welfare under the bus, I'm all for ending corporate welfare too.  
The ones that found out about it did.  Most will next time if it happens again.\n\nObama tried similar shenanigans against FOX and all the news organizations stood in solidarity, they will again.
Nobody said super. 
Old, black, bitter, and full of alcohol.
Oh it's not the alcoholism that bothers me. It's the almost WWIII. Course JFK almost did that too. 
I gave up mine because I firmly believe that if I am willing to draw upon the benefits of being a US citizen then it is my responsibility to serve my country and ensure that those benefits remain available. My life is not more important to me than the continued strength and prosperity of this country. \n\nThat probably sounds dumb or naive to you, but the great thing is I, and millions of others like me, are still willing to make that sacrifice, on your behalf, regardless. 
Cool. Do you want me to use it to help you get off that cross?
I'm not the guy who commented.
Exactly this.  If something happened the doctor would be reviled for having done nothing.  Sometimes medical care hurts, sometimes it causes discomfort.  Sometimes it's necessary.
Every time there's a post about how progressive and awesome this pope is, I comment that he is protecting thousands of pedophiles and shouldn't get a world stage to jaunt around on being super-pope.  I always get nasty remarks and downvoted.  Aaaand, he does pro-pedophile shit.
*Hides Marius Josipovic ID.\n\nYeah, it's me, Uncle Pete.
It's like you found the missing piece to a puzzle my mind was putting together. 
Every time ever. Since I first heard him narrate Spider-Man and his Amazing friends. 
Are you serious? You can't honestly be so intentionally obtuse. The church has brought its power and influence to bear hundreds of times to save pedophile priests from being charged. \n\nSee that's how fucking shit religion is. You're coming down on the side of pedophiles. You actually said "if a priest moves, nothing is stopping charges from being filed..."\n\nFuck, man, just fuck. Your attack against me is to insinuate that I'm a neckbeard basement dweller, but shit, you're taking the churches side on the pedophilia. \n\nI'm not, but I would gladly choose being a disgustingly fat loser over someone who defends pedophiles. 
Congratulations.
It's Carlos Santana, his music is as ethnic and urban as it gets.  He's a legendary Latino performer.
Honestly there are almost no parallels to Trump other than party affiliation. \n\nHowever if you really want to be blown away about Nixon, there's been a ton of stuff that's come out in recent years about his alcoholism and how truly bad it got in the last years of his presidency. He was stone drunk a lot of the time and had to have the Vice President stand in for him more than once. But worst of all he is alleged to have ordered a Nuclear strike on North Korea, but Kissinger stepped in and told the Joint Chiefs to ignore him because he was drunk. \n\nI used to support a lot of stuff Nixon did, but the things that have come out recently have drastically changed my opinion of him. \n\nhttps://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.businessinsider.com/drunk-richard-nixon-nuke-north-korea-2017-1
So you've never heard the foul shit Farrakhan says?  \n\nOh, and unless you believe in conspiracy theories, they're the ones who had Malcom killed. 
Kris, her lover was Kris.
Yeah, he gets to sleep with her, and you're still you.
I get asked this often.  I'm a former Marine, a conservative, and a staunch supporter of 2nd amendment rights, but I don't own and have never owned a gun.\n\nMy wife and I discussed it, and we decided that we shouldn't own one.  Part of it is that we drink too much, part of it is that we both have a temper, but a big part of it is that we don't really need one.  Neither of us hunt, and I'm pretty sure I could deal with any home intruders with my Kabar fighting knife.  It just doesn't make sense for us.
And you should.  Lefties who think this guy is the fucking devil, guess what, your only defense, if he is, is the fucking amendment you've been spending a lifetime trying to take the teeth out of. \n\nMaybe now you see its wisdom.
Pope Francis denounces walls while allowing thousands of pedophiles to find security behind the Church's protection. \n\n
Here in Ohio it's being spun as a liberal victory. He only found a paltry 80-some. \n\nThe fact that there is proof that non-citizens here illegally and voting is treated like it's inconsequential. 
But what if he was? Would that make his point more or less valid? Does Bob Costas have any talent at basketball?  We listen to him.  In fact the people who have the physical talent--which is what beauty is, it takes work too--are the worst to listen to talk about it.  It's people who spend time observing and learning about it that are the authorities.\n\nSo maybe this guy spends a lot of time and effort observing attractive people.  That gives him the right to comment and probably adds weight to his comment as well.\n\nSorry, I'm just tired as fuck of the "Oh and you're beautiful?" response when someone posts a look-how-hot pic and someone says "meh."
Long behold, people care about the economy and safety over which bathrooms people should be allowed to Use.
Eh, the article is from November...
Lol thanks for pointing that out. However I think the observation still stands. 
I continue to resist giving Vox page views. 
I seem to recall in one the old Star Trek movies they gave command of their shiny silvery starship over to a woman with overlarge breasts and she promptly crashed the thing into a planet. In real life, Democrats gave control over their party to a big eared Bolshevik with no political experience and a bad education. Now, the Democrat Party is left a garbage fire with hysterical party loyalists desperately trying to put shut to the flames by peeing on the world and blaming it on the Russians. The best news is Obama has stayed on in Washington, D.C., where he plans to rake over the mess he created like a delusional landfill farmer raising up fields of used plastic bags he calls 'corn.'
It couldn't have happened to a nicer group.... nah I can't even write that with sarcasm.
It is just one article.\n\nThe same idiots still run the party.
if you give a community organizer a political party....
Just now figuring this out are we lefties? Yeesh. Not the sharpest tools right now these folks. Too busy running around with their heads on fire. 
"smoking childish pile of rubble"
Good. 
I was banking on the the left doubling down on alienating progressive policies that require partisan majorities to maintain. This self awareness came way ahead of schedule, especially from Vox. I guess this settles the debate over the left being stupid or just hating this country.
You can't just insult your way to top comment like that.
Yes. Hopefully that will decrease our injury issue.
I just assume I'm getting a sandshrew and hatch it to make room for 2s and 10s.

Just be sure to start slow and go wash your dragon after before having piv. And I heard you need to pee within two hours of it too to ensure you don't get an infection.
Do you live close to the freeway? If so you're likely shit out of luck. Either way I recommend scoping out auto shops nearby and around apartments and hotels. They tend to hold on to vehicles a while before they chop shop them or send them to the Rez border to set on fire.
People always pull this shit during field sobriety tests. It's a tactic used to give the officer the least evidence possible to support probable cause so he can later get it dismissed by motion.
The guy was practically nonexistent this year. He even took multiple days a week off just to rest because he is old. Another year and he would be like mannings Super Bowl run.

That will happen when your name gets mentioned less. Really unless you watch ALOT of football or have been trained in quarterback skills and mechanics, it's pretty hard to tell how a qb is doing outside of how is team is doing.
Staying low, scheming on running in 2020
Or maybe Hillary wasn't relatable to people who didn't live the elite life in Washington DC.
Giving up on what?\n
If only protestors were so vigilant on Election Day.
I don't think we need as much work as this sub says. We've remained competitive for almost a decade and missed the Super Bowl by a few big plays. \n\nThe falcons are good. Really good.thry were the better team in the nfccg and the better team in the Sb. 
Brady is more consistent but Peyton had a stronger prime. K let's go home now

This is what's wrong with our college education system. Students getting educated on creative but grossly unrealistic theories that only promote political propaganda at best.

Life will make them realize that. Reddits demographic tends to be young adults with no life experience, their bills still paid by their parents, and endless time for pushing their beliefs online. Let them take out a mortgage, have some kids, and start working up the corporate ladder and then let's see how they view Bernie sanders and all his free packages "paid for by the one percent."\n\nIn sum, there's a reason people become more conservative with age and society becomes more conservative when shit hits the fan. It baffles me that the left thinks that people are more concerned with gendered bathrooms than real life issues

I rather have bill and McCarthy.
Please keep your comments civil.
Forcing him would be stupid. We would end up with an above average 40 year old that takes 1/4 of our cap.
Nothing in these next four years is going to be typical. Personally, I'm glad he's calling out the press. I'm not a huge fan of trump, but it's hard to deny the media has been against him since day 1. This conference was a sign of strength and honesty I think is refreshing to the American people. I feel he answered most questions more straightforward than he ever has. 
Except Rodgers. Bench him for Hundley.
So? Pokémon go isn't really a race. Plus niantic will have more people investing in lures.

Tight end if he can beat out janis
Why should we give a damn?
Tom Brady. If you're drafted in the 7th round, you probably weren't expected to come out and start performing immediately.
Why? At this point, If you are going to rally against him, it looks petty like a team Edward protest during a team Jacob march. \n\nInstead, pick out something specific you don't like Him doing and speak out against that. That way your voice will be heard on the issues that matter to you. 
Pulling a davante Adams I see....
Geeze is this really a tip?
Perfect example of how democratic policies keep the poor in their place. If they all became rich, they wouldn't vote democrat anymore.

Not sure Americans do either. Whether a shemale can use the women's bathroom isn't the top of your priorities when you get layed off your job and can't find work.
I know my opinion will be unpopular on this sub, but I think our secondary is fine as is. I think Randall and Rollins will earn their paychecks this year and Hyde will help as he always does.\n\nI say draft one between 3-5 and we'll be fine. I'm more concerned with getting some edge rushers.
Imagine how much collective effort is wasted that could be used toward actually improving the lives of the disadvantaged? Why not just go work a full time\nJob and then donate your entire salary to those you say are disadvantaged?
It's a bit patronizing that celebrities think their good looks and popularity make their opinion on politics relevant. 
You make it sound like football is a team sport or something...
That's how I hope I die.
How is he taking any credit for it, unless dak is changed to cornerback, it's not like they are ever on the field at the same time.
Huge difference between passionate play and being a self absorbed prick.
No shit. Who has the time to protest a sign about olives.
He was far from a star, but I think he was pretty underrated by this sub. I heard the draft is deep at rubbing back. So I bet we keep lacy, draft a solid second or third rounder and keep Montgomery out there.
The more tuition money the better amirite
Why do that when you can go out Peyton manning style.
What's ironic is that you're spewing bigoted hate while calling his voters hateful bigots.
And the Vikings. Remember when the Vikings were loaded up with Peterson, Farve, Allen, etc? They were good, they still missed the playoffs and it took years to recover. I like our strategy the best.
Socialism that has no intention of dissolving the state has historically gone by another name.
Phillip rivers. Way underrated, extremely good character, and entertainingly cheesy
Looking to unwind? Are we talking about the same drug?\n
They also said Hillary would win by a landslide. 
Nope, just opinions about celebrities denouncing trump and how bernie would have saved the world.
This made me giggle
I don't think he actually makes the switches, just uses them.
I could care less of his off the field issues. I guarantee you every player on the team (except st. jordy, ) has a ton of skeletons in their closets that would make us want to root for another team. Fortunate for them this isn't a miss congeniality contest it's football. And football is rough aggressive and encourages some of the most violent and otherwise unsavory personalities to rise to the top. \n\nHe isn't really an offensive fit, but I'm sure if he took league minimum we would take him over michaels. For the right price I'll take absolutely any top talent. He is good enough to improve any football team.
Just spit.
People sure do take their Italian food seriously.\n\nPersonally, I'm not a huge fan of olives,  but I could understand some people advocating for fair menu representation.

I don't think I've ever agreed with a post so much.\n\nBut I don't feel that cam will be spectacular for long. He has a very kaepernick feel to\nHim. Probably be great a couple years and then slowly fall off. 
Because NM lawmakers have always made homelessness their number one priority.
If they allowed fighting I'm pretty sure people would die.
So trump will continue to nominate conservative judges and the democrats will continue to decline them. Eventually this will make dens look petty, if the scotus is forced to run on 8 justices for 4+ years.

Capitalism is the worst system except for all the others. No other economic or political system can possibly begin to efficiently allocate a finite number of resources across 6 billion people.  There are ways to harness power of the free market by creating equality of opportunity; but to dismiss it as “neo-liberalism horseshit” is irresponsible.

We will all wallow in Obama's shit long after he has left office.  If Obama repeats his performance in the first term America will be just shy of a 1.3 Debt/GDP ratio; about the level economist believe Greece pasted the point of no return on national solvency. The Affordable Care Act adds to the deficit and should be on the table unless we are willing to dramatically increase taxes on the middle class.
Well she's not smart, the Judeo-Christian god is the same god that Muslims worship, but probably a good idea not to depict the prophet Muhammad if you don't want to constantly be looking over your shoulder.

Market Street is MOC (Lego Factory). While it's modular by design it isn't part of the creator series.  I would recommend selling it while prices are high. It won't hold its value like the Lego designed modular building, especially when more accessible MOCs start to become available.
I have all the sets.  The Green Grocer and the Pet Shop are the most similar in appearance but they use different building techniques, particularly around the bay windows. The Pet shop is slightly more furnished, but Lego pulled a low blow by "painting" the second story to avoid furnishing the apartment side.  The Parisian Restaurant is widely different from these two, it has unique building techniques, tons of detail, creative furnishings.  I wouldn't be surprised if Lego continues to create apartments on top of small businesses, but they will need to remain creative to differentiate the sets.
I'll buy one for sure.
any day now...
I just gained a little bit of respect for the guy.
Can confirm, the mailbox is full.
That would be possible if the Fed wasn't monetizing federal deficits.  If rates return rates to historical averages (5% -10yr treasury notes); our annual interest payment would be $800 billion dollars on 16 trillion of national debt. We can't afford that; the Fed will keep rates artificially low despite inflation and another housing bubble.
Less than a yard 146.78 vs 146.72
You use the word "facts" very loosely. I find it hard to believe that you can insure 30 million more people, reduce premiums, keep adults on their parents plans, offer free contraceptives and reduce the deficit. The CBO claims this is possible using penalties, tax increases, accounting tricks, temporarily cutting payments to doctors and cutting millions from Medicare.  At the end of the day sustainable socialized medicine requires rationing or dramatically higher taxes on the middle class. It isn't free.
Wow, just wow.  That is phenomenal.  Lego should release this immediately. 
I think a school is inevitable, but probably not in the near future.  I suspect they would model it after an indoor inner-city school with 2 class rooms, a principles office and a gym.\n\nAny thoughts on how it might look?

Smokescreen. We're going Paxton Lynch
Nice, a link to MSNBC referencing the CBO. I'm counter your link with a fox news story referencing a heritage foundation study; or maybe just take a second to do some critical thinking of my own and ask "has a government entitlement ever met CBO estimates or reduced the deficit"?  No it would be better to go with the link: http://www.forbes.com/sites/aroy/2012/07/27/cbo-obamacare-will-spend-more-tax-more-and-reduce-the-deficit-less-than-we-previously-thought/
We shall see.  There aren't any other wide spread MOCs that I'm aware of, certainly no other modular Lego Factory branded sets. Prices are going up because the supply is low.  But I don't think future collectors will be interested in this set once more MOCs are available.  I believe the creator series has better designs and will be more desirable in the future.
TehNumberTwo is correct, there's a guy from Copblock who went to jail for releasing taped phone conversations uncovering police abuse.  You must tell the second party they are being taped prior to asking questions because they have a reasonable expectation of privacy.  Screw Jellybeans though, if complaints changed behavior then there wouldn't be police abuse; release FOIA request videos and names all day.
Are you even PC bro? 
The post hit /r/all. The moderator team is a group of volunteers, we are not paid for this. We are banning people; but it's not going to do a whole lot of good. We have to make certain we aren't banning real conservatives who have issues with Trump which takes a bit of time to find out.
You mean the anti-war movement that evaporated the moment Obama was elected? Astroturf and fake to its core.\n\nThey won't take that route. Though with the McCarthism on the rise in the Democratic party they may focus on in the Russian connection as means to protest. But I'm still betting it will be the Bernie "Healthcare is a right" movement who will be screaming about the repeal of ACA.
We trashed Democrats for hiding behind closed door to formulate their bill. Republicans are pretty clear that we wanted:\n\n1. Transparency\n2. Short and concise bills that everyone has read; instead of massive omnibus bills.\n3. Plenty of time for everyone to read it. \n\nYes the media will 24/7 attack it and roll out sob stories of the people who will now "die" because of this new bill. Expect plenty of dishonesty from the media. Fortunately the media has support polls that nearly match congress.
Shapiro has a large following; yes.
Seems to be a trend for the Democrats. There is always a government stream of money going towards a slush fund for Democrats. We've seen it with ACORN (thankfully that shit organization is gone), we've seen it with Planned Parenthood, and we've seen it with public unions. California's politics are literally dominated by Democrats due to public unions provided hundreds of millions of free dollars towards electing Democrats and implementing their policies (not of which has to do with teachers).
>Also, he's completely wrong about Elon Musk, LOL... Musk doesn't actually run "profit making businesses" he runs scam operations funded by the government.\n\nAgreed. His company and expansion has been based off of the government subsidizing all his industries.
> We knew liberals think about about themselves rather than the good of the country, \n\nWhich could explain why they are all about having the government take care of people. Democrats by and large are greedy and do a lot less charity/community service than their conservative counterparts.\n\nScience is sometimes confirming what we already suspect. It also gives us a quantitative analysis of it, where before we had a qualitative assessment of it.
The problem with Trump is we didn't believe his conversion to our ideology based on his history. We feared he would govern as a Democrat while claiming he's a conservative.\n\nClearly we were wrong (so far).
He seems fairly optimistic about a new space age. I hope he's right about Elon in this area; but I have my doubts. This is prior to Trump's speech last night.
It makes sense for the federal government to resolve conflicts between states. And no a state where its pollution blows into another have no incentive to do anything about it.
I'm giving them until the summer before I sharpen my pitchfork and light my torch. They know they are on the line to deliver.
Wow... My hands would hurt to clap that long.
>or find other revenue in order to cover the cost, which the Department of Homeland Security has said could top $20 billion to build and maintain.\n\nDo you think this will be a problem? If the wall takes 3 years to build, you can divide this over a 3 years period. I personally don't think the wall will do a whole lot, but it will slow down border crossers.\n\n>Mr. Trump: “I will be asking the Congress to approve legislation that produces a $1 trillion investment in the infrastructure of the United States—financed through both public and private capital—creating millions of new jobs.\n\nDefinitely my biggest issue with his plan. Though he has been announcing this for a while.\n\n>Mr. Trump: “I am also calling on this Congress to repeal and replace Obamacare with reforms that expand choice, increase access, lower costs, and at the same time, provide better health care.”\n\nAs I have repeatdly stated elsewhere. I think this will be the main venue of attack against Republicans. Any person kicked off Medicare or loses their insurance will be rolled out onto the news (every media outlet) to say how terrible Trump and Republicans are. They have pre-empted this already with sob stories of "I would have died had it not been for Obamacare".\n\nAs for taxes, they are do for an overhaul. It will be a major undertaking; but as long as they are simplifying them business should be happy.
I'm sorry the Republicans weren't just sitting there twiddling their thumbs with nothing else going on. This is non-sense being pushed by the left. The Obamacare entitlements went into affect this last year; which means millions of people are now addicted to free money.\n\nYou need to carefully approach this or you risk losing everything.
> So I would not lose hope for the moral high ground.\n\nNo I agree. We should strive to be the best that we can be. I was just referring to a tactic employed on the left out of the Rules of Radicals. We must be aware that the left intentionally cedes the moral high ground just so they can destroy us with it. We need to be careful in how we "hold standards". Christians believe people make mistakes and should be forgiven those mistakes. Unfortunately politicians will never admit to making a mistake (it's the nature of the beast).\n\n>Either it implies he is terrifyingly gullible or idealistic to the point of facts being secondary to him.\n\nIt makes me think he is delegating everything within his administration. Which is generally what an executive should do... But it is a bit distressing to see it so obvious. Bush at least tried to stay informed on the on-goings of his administration.
Agreed. We wanted for all legislators to have had read the bill before it passed. We wanted it open to the public for debate. While they are not moving as fast as we would like; this is a serious issue that needs careful consideration.\n\nI have stated I'm giving them until the summer to do this task. Maybe I'm more forgiving than most conservatives. Arguably the repeal could be done immediately; but I imagine the backlash is something we should be mindful of.
As the Constitution was written by Christian men in a very Christian nation it is impossible for a conflict between the two.
I'll give you a hint. The founder of this spin off had been a socialist his entire life. They had decided the transitional state that communism used was the end goal instead of the communist Utopia. They moved the collectivist moral philosophy found in communist philosophy to the the state. A state centric moral philosophy.\n\nThis movement is often mischaracterized by period social policies that existed in every other government of the time to a certain extent. This is done to distract from its origins.
The TPP comment got less of an applause. I doubt that many Republicans supported Trump on this. And Democrats will refuse to clap for him for any reason.
It is a pretty ridiculous statement that Christians who lived in a nation where 95%+ people were Christian wrote a document that wouldn't have any conflicts with Christian beliefs? I'm agnostic. This isn't a biased statement; this is called common sense.
Well there was a large falling out during the primaries. I don't think conservatism is "anti" anything. You can disagree with Trump's policies; but being anti-Trump is not a conservative position. That's more a personal position; and I can understand that. 
Project Veritas revealed this tactic last summer. Like usual Democrats continue the tactics while pretending as if they "cleaned up". Meanwhile they scream incoherently about "doctored" videos to fool the useful idiots.
Sanders refers to a lot of things that all include larger power to the state. No you don't get to lump everything together to deflect his inane comments. He references other countries that doesn't mean what he proposes matched those countries.\n\nYour politics are revealed by not knowing the answer to the above riddle. Please refer to the Mission Statement on the sidebar.
Israel was drafted and ratified by the League of Nations. The United Nations when formed was also sworn to uphold the binding agreement that created Israel, Jordan, Syria, Iraq, etc. The fact that Jordan occupied the land after seizing it in a military attack shortly after the new nations were created doesn't suddenly make the land not Israels.
Welcome!\n\nI'll make sure you're added as an approved submitter. Feel free to start discussions.
Leadership. Public opinion has nothing to do with performance. It deals with likability. Obama was a media based candidate who was as likable as any celebrity.
Now that is leadership. Moving for unity and trying to build confidence. Confidence is one of the most powerful effects a president can have on a nation.
Why is this called Obamacare? The replacement will be Trumpcare or McConnellcare. There is obvious political motivation for calling it that.
My job is in modeling and simulation. I started following the climate modeling as a hobby around 2009. I don't have active links to the papers as it's a subject I grew bored of. Climate models for the most part are neither verified nor are they validated. In the realm of M&S these would never be accepted or used by a legitimate organization. The scientists who wrote these shitty models have tried to hide behind "peer review"; this would not fly in any other field. But here we are.\n\nAs for the other comment. The *subject* of climate change is so insanely partisan that it can be used as a litmus to tell whether or not you're a Republican or a Democrat. This means there are just as many Democrats that support the idea of catastrophic climate change due to partisan reasons as there are Republicans.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgLLQEEiohc\n\nBill Whittle seems way more optimistic than either of us; but seems related to our discussion. He brings up the three necessary phases to see a technological revolution: 1.) Scientific validity (is it possible) 2.) Engineering validity (can it be appropriately applied) 3.) Economic validity (is there are market for it).
No....\n\nOkay you're right.
Our healthcare system is far to the left from where it was before Obama. Our regulatory system is far to the left from where it was before Obama. Our judiciary is further to the left since Obama.\n\nThe political back lash gave power back to conservatives within the Republican party, but that doesn't mean the country (government) is more conservative. It doesn't matter if the public at large is more conservative (they have always been center right) if government policy keeps moving towards the leftist agenda.
Leftists tend to confuse Science Fiction and reality. Science fiction *at best* is an extrapolation based on certain technologies and performs thought experiments. Though Star Trek is pretty much fantasy with a bit of science thrown into it. 
There are 300 million+ people in this nation who get their news from certain sources. What are the  average ratings of Limbaugh?
Nice post!\n\nI'll give a counter argument for why this is an issue. Romney. He was a boy scout in terms of honesty. Yet he was made to look like a lying, cheating, dishonest rich boy.\n\nCruz was also made to look dishonest. All it takes is for a opposition group to formulate a narrative; and it nearly always sticks. The narrative for Cruz was that he was an opportunist who would do or say anything to get to power. So suddenly a pinnacle of principle and honesty is made to look like a liar and a back stabber.\n\nI have read that in the Rules of Radicals; it is always best to cede the high ground to the opposition in terms of moral behavior. The reason being is you can use their presumed morality against them and to destroy them. Being 100% honest is not an actual possibility by any human. We even lie to ourselves on some level without realizing it. This is why provocateurs like Milo were so successful and why the alt-right loved him. So one of the easiest arguments to make against a politician is that they are a liar. Why? Because they make thousands of speeches and public comments. It is not hard to find them in a lie.\n\nTrump does lie. He also uses hyperbole a lot which the media will jump onto as lies. What he has done is ceded the high ground on it; which worked because he was facing Hillary.\n\nFinally as I told many conservatives before. Do not associate yourself with the Trump administration. He will do things we like; and he will likely do things we hate. Ben Shapiro has this right approach with his "Good Trump, Bad Trump". But I warn you not to fall for the Democratic trap on this issue. You can easily obsess over a "Trump lie" (or exaggeration) that really doesn't matter.\n\nWhat are lies should we care about? Following through on promises to Conservatives. His integrity is sticking to get his campaign promises in general; we as conservatives shouldn't care about that too much (as he has made promises we don't like).
>No, they aren't done. Politics ebbs and flows. They'll get their time again, as we have now. 8 years ago, they said the same about Republicans.\n\nDon't be a wet blanket :). Democrats will have to adapt to the times and change their tactics. They haven't yet adapted.
Welcome!\n\n>Two of my family members have unfriended me on Facebook.\n\nSorry to hear that. Before Facebook my father and I had several political fights to the point that he "disowned me". It was kind of ridiculous; but it was enough for me to realize that it isn't worth losing family over We made up of course; but I made it a point to not talk politics with family if it's an upsetting subject. So Facebook also had that rule for me as well.\n\nI've recently backed off on it due to not wanting leftist to squelch my political opinions. But I keep what I do post on Facebook fairly civil.
The socialist what to take wealth a money away from people. This is theft that nearly everyone agrees is wrong. Socialist also want equal outcome. This means no matter how hard you work it won't matter. The socialist despises the individual and that includes individual rights. They value the collective or the state, not the individual.
That's about what I would expect from them.
One of the most important jobs of the president is leadership. I think Trump delivered on it here. He pushed for unity and he pushed for confidence. He didn't call out Democrats for their childish behavior. The speech was great.\n\nI'm pretty unhappy about the "Infrastructure Spending" as the Obama stimulus was completely mishandled and I would rather not see the money be sent to political donors as is usually the case. Maybe Trump will be better?
I love how fox panned to McCain on that comment about former enemies.
Did you just wake up today and find out Trump was president?
They have always lost the war against news control; the bureaucrats in D.C. are against them as well as the media.\n\nI have no clue if they are drafting something or not. Trump says his team is drafting something. \n\nMy guess:\n\n1. Congress (both houses of congress) has dozens of proposed bills from its various members that it is trying to work through.\n\n2. The president has his own ideas of what he wants to work through.\n\n3. Democrats (those willing to work with Republicans) will be proposing their own ideas, but they know they are in a minority position.\n\n4. All groups will have to mesh out a bill. Most of the fighting will happen between various Republicans in congress who like their own bills; and then a fight will happen between the White House and Congress.\n\n5. Once there is a bill that has majority support from all interested parties, they will draft it. This is likely where we will see some pork being introduced to get some parties to sign on. This is also the point in which it should be introduced to the public.\n\n6. With the bill released various amendments will be added to the bill. Some of these amendments will be "Poison Pills" by democrats who want to see it fail. Hopefully Republicans will repeal Obamacare separately; so if Democrats sabotage the replacement that is on them.\n\n7. The two houses will make their final compromises and pass the law/laws (hopefully it will be broken up and not some behemoth bill that no one has read). Then Trump will sign it.
I hope that is the case. Identity politics are ridiculous. 
I'm seeing the reeee reference a lot. I must have missed the meme. What is this in reference to?
No. That seems to be a personal belief. Regardless it is a mostly irrelevant issue that people like to beat the drums on. Very few professions actually require intimate knowledge of evolution. Ben Carson a world class brain surgeon is a creationist, his beliefs on evolution had no impact on his career.
Federalism generally means a division between the central government; federal government and the states. In general conservatives like the states to have more power and the power is closer to the people instead of far away in D.C. This means the federal government is very limited in scope and power based on Constitutional constraints and the states are given significantly more power to impact the lives of its citizens.
Teacher Unions. They don't like any performance based system.
/r/climateskeptics debates this all the time; and they are the community who focuses on that issue.\n\nIt is stated that the Climate Change debate is actually the most partisan issue in the nation right now. You seem to imply that only Republicans are partisan on it; but Democrats as well. This has to do with proposed solutions to the "problem". Leftists are pushing their typical political platforms they have pushed for the last century as the "only solutions" to this. This clearly makes Republican who know nothing about the science skeptical of the entire agenda.\n\nMore than any other issue in politics asking a person if they believe in catastrophic climate change will nearly always tell you whether or not they are a Republican or a Democrat. And the Democrats are by and large scientifically illiterate (as much as the Republicans are).\n\nAs someone who has studied the science for years I can tell you I am skeptical due to the science and not the politics. I was actually on board for climate action based on surface level reads on the subject in the early 2000's. As I dug into the IPCC reports and the actual scientific papers it became clear the case was over stated. The science has been completely corrupted by politics (not just in the United States).
Obama was a shit leader by all metrics and the media was absolutely glowing with praise for him the entire time.\n\nStop pretending as if the media isn't biased or that they weren't caught red handed by wikileaks colluding with the DNC.
> Truthfully, I believe that the federal government is lost and will remain lost without state intervention. I might dare go so far as to say that the Federal Government is.... illegitimate.... I might...\n\nSo you're a big supporter of the Article 5 movement? I don't have a lot of faith of that succeeding, though it is a worthy movement.\n\n>Conservatism, today, stands more for authoritarianism and moral equivalency than for personal or individual liberty.\n\nI fail to see that.\n\n>This is evidenced strongly by the fact that, in spite of having a vast majority in congress, only 3 or 4 of the so-called conservatives in congress actually care about the constitution.\n\nYou seem to think that these elected officials are not represented of the public at large. This is why I railed on the Culture War above. This is the exact reason I started to study this subject. It isn't that the elected official don't care about the Constitution (they don't) it's that the public at large doesn't give a fuck. It took me years of beating my head against a wall to finally figure out "why" people don't care. And it comes to the culture war.\n\nUnderstanding the public at large and their interests and reasoning capabilities. Study have study has shown most voting age adults would fail a basic Civics test. What is the best way to reach people? \n\n1. Education\n2. Media/Hollywood\n3. Internet\n\nThe first 2 have been dominated by cultural Marxists/leftists for the past half century. Conservatives who stand by their "principles" do nothing to combat this. Because we don't believe the government should get involved (even though leftists use the government to implement their war all the time); but what we fail to realize is that there are other ways of affecting change outside of government. Political activism as seen by the Tea Party which had a resounding success even though it was demonized by the media.\n\nThe internet which should be bastion of knowledge has turned into a vast echo chamber. People will find sources that tell them what they want to hear and will believe it. This actually empowers *reactionary* movements (alt-right, Trumpians). And when a reactionary movement rises from their hate against Trump the internet will be the vehicle in which it was delivered. Even Obama/Democrats in 2006 and 2008 elections were helped greatly by MoveOn.org and their "reactionary" hate of Bush (what we called the Bush Derangement Syndrome).\n\nThe culture war is understanding the "how" and "why" the population is where it is and pushing back upon it. Understanding that tools like Jon Stewart had a massive impact on the culture war which has pushed us to the point that 40% of millennials believe socialism is a valid economic system.\n\nBut to bring this back on topic (as I diverged quite a bit). Education ignores the constitution; it is briefly covered in U.S. history. The media will *never* mention it; but they will mention made up "rights" and clauses that have no basis in the Constitution (like Separation of Church and state, that large quantities of people actually believe is based in the Constitution). This complete apathy on the Constitution has allowed the SCOTUS to unilaterally rewrite the constitution with no back lash from the population.\n\nNow Trump has claimed he supports "Rule of Law". Guess what Trumpians the reactionaries are parroting? "Rule of Law". They are doing it for the wrong reasons, but they are being swayed towards our cause. Immigration is another Rule of Law issue, again Trumpians are all about it. The more they coalesce around Rule of Law the more they will come to respect and value the Constitution. Trump is also shitting all over the media; which in a vacuum would be terrible. But the media has been biased for decades in the last few years has been proven to be colluding with the DNC to control the news. It's an institution that has been undermining Conservative for decades (even under Reagan).\n\n>The left are masterful at changing and controlling the language. They did it when they started calling us "conservatives" (which has a very different meaning in the rest of the world) and started calling themselves "liberals" (which likewise has a very different meaning in the rest of the world) - We foolishly embraced the term, and got stuck in a box that shouldn't have ever been descriptive of us in the first place. But truthfully, that's a conversation for another time.\n\nOne of my culture war posts is about this subject. :). The left does manipulate the narrative and the language on a whole host of issues. Did you know "Capitalist" was a term made up by the left? Capitalism itself is rooted in leftist ideologues; yet we use it. This why I always call them "the left" now as I refuse to call them liberals. \n\n>That's what president Hillary Clinton thought about the election. (a joke). We don't need a majority, we need a super majority of the states... and we're not far from that goal.\n\nYou're banking on the Republicans at the state level being more conservative than what we have in congress.\n\n>The red's? to grow the federal government as rapidly as can be done without going as fast as the blue team.... And we still cheer for "our" team.\n\nYou need to understand the emotional issues with this. Mandatory spending doesn't get voted on every year; it automatically goes up. These programs were implemented decades ago. When Paul Ryan wanted to do entitlement reform Democrats immediately started running ads of him pushing a grandma off of a cliff. The very hint of repealing Obamacare has every media outlet (again enemies to conservatives) rolling out sob stories of people claiming "I would have died had it not been for Obamacare" (AKA medicare expansion, costing tax payers billions).\n\nIt's easy to say; let's cut it. It's quite another to do it as you need a public mandate in order to achieve it. Else whatever you roll back the Democrats will put back up but make it even worse. A large majority of Americans are emotionally driven. This is a fact of life. Facts are good as is reason; but if you are unable to connect on an emotional level (as are all Democratic attacks) you will fail to convince large swaths of people.\n\nThe red teams only area of "spend a lot" is the military. That's a different discussion though.\n\n>the federal government isn't going to reel itself in. it's time the states do it for them. The progressives in both parties lose the tools they are using to strip our liberties... and the states still retain the right to be the People's Socialist Republic of California and the Libertarian Republic of Kentucky, if they so choose. The great American Experiment continues, and liberty lives on.\n\nI live in California... Regardless it still takes a public mandate to see those issues driven through the states to a Constitutional convention. If you had that type of public mandate congress would act (though it would drag its feet). We'll see if it happens.
That isn't how this works. Liberals don't get to yank the country far to the left when they are in power and conservative "work with them" when they are in power. If that is the case the country goes further and further to the left. Yeah it benefits liberals.\n\nTrump did state he would directly work with Democrats to address several issues. He didn't just call for unity.
Yeah I watched the video. He was there to sell his book to raise funds for veterans; he was being bombarded with questions unrelated to it so he gave some non-answers.
That would make sense if we didn't just have 8 years of Obama showing that you are dead wrong. 
As Andrew Klavan says: New York Times (formerly known as a newspaper).
We currently benefit from it. Until we have a better strategy to win on the culture war this is all we're left with.
/u/DEYoungRepublicans put me onto a video a while back that broke down the "Green" movement pretty good. Something about "blue". The video makes clear that the environmentalists in the "Green" movement are not ecologists. They rarely have science backing their assertions; it is purely emotional.\n\nAnother thing interesting to note about the "Green" movement is that they are anti-human activity in the environment. It doesn't matter if that activity makes the environment better for humans or even if it makes it better for the natural inhabitant. They have this warped perception that the environment is better without man.\n\nLogging companies are very good for the forest. It's not like what they used to be in the 19th and early 20th century (clear cutting everything). These industries understand that the forest needs to remain healthy and allow it to regrow if they want their business to continue. Yet environmentalists still go after them killing jobs and industries all across the United States (and other places).
Except we don't just let the leftist keep the policy they enacted when they rammed it down our throats. If we're talking about new policy; yes we bring everyone to the table and work out a good path forward. What the Democrats want is for us to not touch all the shit they rammed through without any Republican support. Fuck that shit.
I think the parties believe they have to do it or the other side will spin it as the president is despised.
As Andrew Klavan says: New York Times, formerly known as a newspaper.
As we learned in the 80's. Amnesty without fixing the problem exacerbates the problem. You've just told the world that if you run here as fast as you can eventually you'll be an American.
Good. You're on the wrong side of history on this. This will help to keep your a minority party for a long while.
That's the point. They don't, but they pretend as if they do. Conservatives can't just say they are inept, people need to understand that it is absolutely immoral.
I've seen this thug life thing used for Shapiro. Pretty funny.
Here comes the big spending...
> It's hard to talk when this much hyperbole is being used.\n\nThat is what happens when you cede any input on how the country is run because you refuse to work with people you disagree with. You can call it hyperbole all you want; but all you're doing is shutting down the conversation.\n\nYou have not countered my point on this. Do you want to implement a conservative vision for this country? If you do; you need to provide a path forward that isn't "one day people will wake up!" Part of the path forward is having the power within a coalition to implement conservative change.\n\n>Accepting Radical elements under the umbrella of your ideology is a sure way for your beliefs to be utterly consumed. \n\nThere is no accepting. True conservatives (not those who identify as conservative) make up a small minority of this country. Which means if you want *any say* on law or how the country is governed **you are required** to work with non-conservatives. If you don't want to work with "radicals", you need to have a new coalition that builds us a majority.\n\n>Look at the pitiful remains of the American Liberalism as radical leftists ravage it. The same thing will surely happen to American Conservatism if right wing radicalism is tolerated\n\nThe left was always morally bankrupt. They exploited social issues of the early 20th century to grow the federal government. They weren't "ravaged" by radicals, they were radicals. Blue Dog Democrats (supposedly Conservative Democrats) were run out of the party. They were never called "liberals".\n\nFinally there is no stopping people from "identifying" as conservative. We just need to make certain that they know they aren't conservative for the positions that they hold. Many Trumpians have already claimed they are not conservative, but "Nationalists". It's a reactionary movement to the left.
https://www.reddit.com/r/ConservativeMeta/\n\nThis has been a long running issue ever since I joined reddit 5 years ago on this subreddit. It is not new. The moderator team has been expanded recently (I'm a recent recruit) to help weed out and ban concern trolls/non-conservatives who are aggressively taking over the discussion. \n\nWe just had a stickied post yesterday telling non-conservatives to chill and to review the Mission Statement. We ask that if you find a non-conservative concern trolling or aggressively posting to report their comment/s. We have a report queue that we go through and we will eventually ban them when we come across it.\n\nOne other thing to note is that any post that hits /r/all (lots of upvotes) is going to have many people swarm in from /r/all. Those people are likely going to be only visiting /r/conservative because of that specific meme/article.
I don't care if they play fair. I want them to have read the bill and I want them to ensure we conservatives have also read it. \n\nLet us not forget that Republicans nearly betrayed us on Immigration a short time ago. I'm willing to trust them to do the right thing, but I want to be able to verify.
This is a conservative subreddit.
Obama's stimulus certainty was. Went to pad the pockets of Democratic donors and very little was put into infrastructure. I don't have high hopes for this bill either.
I'm talking about people like Bernie promoting socialist policies in the United States. This has nothing to do with foreign policy.
>Feelings of guilt are a direct threat to one's sense that they are a moral person and, accordingly, research on guilt ﬁnds that this emotion elicits strategies aimed at alleviating guilt that do not always involve undoing one's actions. Furthermore, research shows that individuals respond to reminders of their group's moral culpability with feelings of outrage at third-party harm-doing. These findings suggest that feelings of moral outrage, long thought to be grounded solely in concerns with maintaining justice, may sometimes reflect efforts to maintain a moral identity.\n\nSeems to spell out "Social Justice" pretty accurately. I'll drop a reminder here that Obama thought the job of the SCOTUS was to implement social justice, keep that mind about what the left wants to do to our justice system.\n\n>Respondents who read that Chinese consumers were to blame had similar guilt levels regardless of whether they had the opportunity to express moral outrage.\n\nInteresting. It's as if the human psyche looks for a way to offload the guilt. But if there is no way to do so it won't.\n\n>But when the high-collective-guilt folks were given the neutral exercise and couldn't assert they were good people, they wound up with more moral outrage at third parties. Meanwhile, for those low in collective guilt, affirming their own moral goodness first led to marginally more moral outrage at corporations.\n\nSo this is why identity politics is so important for political manipulation. If you can get their "collective guilt" high enough you can direct them to more moral outrage at the targets of your choice.
Not really.
The plan will likely be written by congress. So Trump isn't going to be the one rolling out the details.
>I can certainly be said to be fiscally conservative in many issues regarding the Swedish economy.\n\nThis subreddit is for American conservatism (which doesn't mean the same thing in other countries). If you find that you align with American fiscal conservatives, feel free to speak up on those topics.\n\nOn topics you do not align with American conservatives you are asked to be 1.) Respectful 2.) Constructive (not contrarian, which is typical of concern trolls) 3.) Honest (as in you're honest about your positions before making statements).
They don't think it be like it is, but it do
> Why is it those things? Because it's pro-libertarian, it's pro-individualism, it's pro-liberty, and those things that conservatism is "pro" means that it must oppose the opposite of those things.\n\nThat's what I meant; we stand for these things. Though I would rather not go down this rabbit hole.\n\n>While the latter is likely closer to me currently, I will always support right action, regardless of who does it.\n\nAs is important for conservatives. We failed in this regard under Bush who swung to the left in his second term.\n\n>But let's also be clear. Trump is not a conservative. even now he doesn' claim conservatism\n\nHe doesn't need to be as long as we hold him to his promises. He made quite a few promises to conservatives; such as Supreme Court picks. He has made it clear he will follow through with his promises. It doesn't matter if he isn't conservative as long a we force him to make conservative positions. We are currently stuck with him as president; so it's best to work with what we have.\n\n>Another thing that conservationism is "anti"? We're anti-personalities. Why? because we're pro-principles. The two are dichotomous.\n\nReagan was anti-personalities? I think at its core conservatives are effectualists and ideologues mixed together. But at the same time in order to win over the bulk of Americans using emotional/personal appeals is important. This means having your principles understood; basing your principles based off of the facts and data and being able to argue those facts with emotion and moral conviction.\n\n>I was proud to be, until recently, a constituent of the great Mike Lee.\n\nMike Lee is awesome. \n\n>Can trump's supporters say the same thing? If the answer is 'no' (and it has proven to be 'no' over and over again) then those peope cannot claim conservative principles on that topic - they've abandoned principle in favor of personality.\n\nHave any of his actions as president violated these? My only concern so far was his executive order telling the IRS not to enforce the Individual Mandate. But considering it will be repealed in the next 6 months I'm willing to forgive this slight offense.\n\nFinally something conservative ideologues need to understand is that we are not a majority. 40% of Americans "identify" as conservative. Of those 40% are people like Trump supporters who "identify" as conservative. That means even with the people you find offensive you *still* do not have a majority. This is why politics requires political coalitions (among various ideologues) in order to form a ruling government (party). Some may call this "Big Tent", but it is the reality of a democratic system.
> I actually thought it was - we don't stand against things, we stand for them. I wasn't necessarily trying to argue, but to point out an important nuance.\n\nWe are not defined by what we are against. If all you are is against shit; you're an empty shell. By defining yourself as "anti" anything you are made up of negative positions which makes no sense. You're a reactionary at that point; which ironically enough puts you in the same category as the Trump supporters.\n\nBut yes; this argument is pointless which is why I didn't elaborate on it even though you chose to contest it.\n\n>Too many conservatives are too willing to play Red vs Blue... and it needs to stop.\n\nThis is the realist vs. the ideologue argument. Which I'm sure you have additional comments on later in your post. I have posited discussions on this exact issue before on this board with few responses. What is the line between being a rigid ideologue and a realist? A rigid ideologue will find that he/she will never see their vision implemented but they will be happy knowing that they were true to their convictions. This is why I do not get along with libertarians. They are generally hard core ideologues and they wonder why they have zero political influence and the country ignores them for the most part. Their largest successes were hybrids of conservatives.\n\n>I agree, which is why I have been very vocal (not so much on reddit, I've taken a reddit hiatus until the last couple days)\n\nAfter Cruz lost the primary I left reddit for a few months. It is definitely best to take a break every so often.\n\n>we'll end up with the most constitutionally conservative president since Coolidge!... I mean... I hope...\n\nCoolidge was a bit more hands off. But one of my favorite presidents. But yes the left are helping the conservative cause, as unlike Bush who was desperate to be liked by the media and the left Trump doesn't seem to care.\n\n>But we, as conservatives, struggle to admit "yes, and he was wrong"\n\nPart of the problem is the sheer success he had on the economy. Largest economic growth after stagnation the decade before, interest rates were finally brought under control, and the soviet union brought to its knees. While Reagan wasn't the most conservative president (his spending was off the charts with his Democratic congress); he was arguably a great president none the less. But as Ben Shapiro has stated many times; do not feel the need to defend other Republicans. I do agree it is hard to defend Reagan as he had his issues.\n\n>need to stop seeking out and supporting Saviors to the conservative movement.\n\nI agree. Unfortunately due to the nature of the population at large you need to have someone to effectively communicate to the masses. Not every person is political; nor are they informed on every subject. \n\n>I'm talking about Personality... like, individual persons... Sean Hannity is a TV Personality... for example... Mike Lee is a conservative and constitutional hero and congressional personality.\n\nCelebrity worship is what I call it. It's a problem in American culture that is perpetuated by Hollywood. This isn't limited to politics.\n\n>I would suggest that if we stopped supporting parties and personalities, and started standing firm for our principles, we would be a majority.\n\nI have less faith in the American electorate. This is why I have dedicated many of my discussions on this board to the "Culture War". The population at large is a fickle group; they are not affected by facts or reason. If they were the unlawful shit the Democrats have been pulling since the time of FDR would have never stood. People don't care as much about the Rule of Law as they did when this nation was founded. They were affected by emotional and moral arguments more so than they are about effectual arguments. \n\n>We don't need to be a majority, because classical liberalism is.... Liberty.\n\nConservatives stands for Classical Liberalism, Federalism, and the Rule of Law. There are also inherent values associated with it that some connect to the Judo-Christian value system. Though that's kind of wrapped into Classical Liberalism.\n\n>Conservatives don't need to be a majority to win that battle. \n\nProgressives have always had their eye on making change far removed from the people. They would quite literally support UN resolutions that dictate to the little people of America if they thought they could get away with it. They will never settle for a federalist approach as they know their ideas cannot compete with ours. They will continue to use Judicial Activism to subvert the will of the people when it doesn't agree with them and they will continue to push their change from the federal level onto all the states.\n\nYou need a majority in order to implement reform or to even hold on to the current system. The coalition is all that allows us to maintain a majority. We were very principled all through Obama's 8 years, we still got the shit he shoved through and we got stuck with Trump. You need to be active in the culture war and move beyond hoping that people will just wake up. It really takes a perception of little faith in the American electorate. Call me a pessimist in that regard.
> Sure we should be attempting to convince the population to be conservatives.\n\nMean while Democrats stack all 9 seats of the court with Judicial Activists who claim it is unconstitutional to be Christian, that gender identity is a right, and that all income will be taxed at 95%. You lose everything. Ideologue rigidity is a sure way to find yourself a permanent minority at the fringes of society with no sway over political discourse (similar to libertarians).\n\nA coalition is people that share some of your beliefs but not all of them. And ideally you sacrifice lower level priorities to achieve higher level ones. And while you are in a coalition with them you work to convince them that your way is better; and you also have a national platform in order to achieve it.\n\nFinally the "identify" comment was to illustrate to you (as you seem to be ignoring the point) that *true* conservatives likely make up only 20-30% of the country. This became apparent with the rise of Trump. 
Welcome. Do you care for federalism as the primary form of government? \n\nIt seems you were alienated by the left which pushed you to the right. You care about the Rule of Law and individual liberties. Is Trump the only person on the right that you like?
If you want fist fights on congressional floor that's how you get fist fights :P.
To have a majority you have to form a coalition of ideologies. Only 40% of Americans identify as conservative. That includes Trump conservatives. You will be a permanent minority if you are unable to work with people you disagree with.
Obama shouldn't be a bench mark for this ;). But I guess we thought Trump would give Obama a run for his money on being though most narcissistic president. It is clear that Obama will remain the biggest narcissistic asshole to sit in the office based on Trump's trending so far.
Ben Shapiro wrote it.
Nearly every subsidized system gets inflated and corrupted. You think you're doing a good thing until you find out that no one can afford it anymore. You mention healthcare and education; both of which have seen massive rises in costs via government subsidies. 
> We own pretty much all of the internet's structures; the platforms; social media outlets, everything.\n\nI don't think that's true. Google, Facebook, Microsoft are all owned and operated by people on the left. Media leaders that own the various news stations and news papers are on the left. Hollywood I'm less familiar with, but I'm pretty certain they are also on the left.\n\n>You really do not want to 'fight' us.\n\nI agree that this is going to ramp up if they keep pushing us in this direction. But I'm not as confident that we have control over the venues of information.
They have stated that they won't pursue tax reform until the ACA has been addressed. Healthcare seems to be the first big item.
Oh I agree. I have been looking for their angle of attack since they lost the election. Eventually they will reveal it. My bet is on fear mongering over the repeal over Obamacare; but we'll see.
I don't know the politics there, but that does sound bazaar. Women overwhelmingly voted for Gov. Brown who called his opponent a whore. And they still support Bill Clinton by large margins even though he is likely a rapist.
How is Capitalism immoral? It is very easy to make immoral arguments about socialism.\n\n1. They rob the entrepreneurial spirit and crush innovation and exploration.\n\n2. They steal from people that they consider wealth as they what equality, not equal opportunity. Theft is an incredibly immoral action.\n\n3. They neither value individual liberty nor the individual themselves. They are a collective/state based value system that they value higher than the individual. This is why in socialist countries/communist countries they have no issue sending people to their deaths by the millions as the individuals mean nothing to the over all society.\n\nI could go on. Socialists are morally bankrupt while they pretend as if they "care".
Juu ei. CNN ja MV ei voi millään verrata toisiinsa, ihan eritasoiset mediat. 
> Thomas Wilhelmsson\n\nEn jaksanut pitemmälle lukea mutta Wilhelmssonhan on HY:n kansleri, joten uskoisi että jonkinlaista pätevyyttä ainakin on. :D
While this is a joke/meme; it is important to note that it isn't just a matter of not "understanding economics", there is a moral bankruptcy in the socialist movement that needs to be condemned. If you don't make the moral case people will take the socialists as misguided "but caring" individuals. \n\nAsk yourself who people will ultimately vote for? The person who is incompetent but cares for the people and is just trying to do the right thing or the person who is competent but hates poor people and minorities? Socialists have no qualms (actually their entire political platform) with attacking conservatives and the free market enterprise system. Do not cede the moral ground as that will lose us the political argument in the long run with the bulk of people.
Yes. You got it. Generally those on the left are incapable of making the connection. But perhaps the Swedish left are a bit more observant of history.\n\nRegardless. I have reviewed your posting history and you don't seem to hold any conservative positions. You seem to be here to fight with conservatives which is in violation of the Mission Statement. If you have something constructive to add (not contrarian) feel free to do so. Else this is an offense that we ban for.
I believe you're touching upon the arguement fallacy of false equivalency. It's very effective as all you need is one example and you can claim the opposition is just as bad as you.\n\nI'm told another arguement fallacy is at play here which is "what aboutism". Which is claiming a purity for one side but refuses to consider context of the other.\n\nI do think we should be willing to cede the point that Trump does lie. Our arguement is that the lies are meaningless compared to the lies of the left. Trump is a braggard who exaggerates a lot and has a habbit of speaking on subjects he is not fully informed on. The round about is that Obama did the same thing on hot button issues used to divide us.
So how could Cruz compromise? The anti establishment wave was built off of the Republican leadership failing to stand up to Obama, which is *why* Cruz raised such a stink. The immigration bill was also a complete sell out on conservatives. That wasn't a compromise as we got nothing out of it.\n\nThe GOP leadership were pissed that a freshman Senator would dare call them out on it. 
You don't need to. What I'm saying is the 40% who *identify* as conservative include them.\n\nIf you have a plan to form a ruling majority, I'm all ears.
I almost never buy clothing online but last time I did this. Seeing as returns is free might as well, saves you the hassle of reordering in case the first try didn't turn out well, and thus lets you wear the correct size immediately. \n\nI pay with a credit card so the price isn't that much of a factor, but last time I paid only the amount for the clothes I kept, and as there was still something left on the bill I incurred interest, and only got the refund for the next bill.
I would take the results of this poll with a pinch of salt. It was conducted before the EO, by a pollster with a consistent +3 % republican bias. 
National polls were pretty accurate, it was just the state polls that failed. National polls had Hillary at +3 %, with a margin of error of 3 %. The final result IIRC was 1,5 % for Hillary, well within the margin of error, but statepolls in places like Michigan and Wisconsin were far less accurate. Just the fact that Hillary had her support in wrong states (more in states like CA and TX compared to Obama), compared with the small but completely normal polling error meant that Trump could win with the result.
In Europe that fee is paid for by the seller, and baked into the prices. But they're just contracting a software vendor to process the payment.\n\nSome companies add on like 1 € if you still get your bill mailed to you by snailmail. Most people set up automatic payments through their online bank, that automatically deducts the bill every month.
* If I open a comment-section, (needed e.g. to view the (i.redd.it)-links), I can' vote on the image, can vote on the comments. Can't vote on other threads while in them OTOH.\n\n* No link back to /R/prequelmemes from the threads.\n\nThat's it for my feedback. Have to say it looks quite horrible otherwise, I don't like it and would prefer to have the default, easier to read.
IIRC, Obama offered to cooperate on Obamacare, but Republicans refused.
Are the microprocessors made in Asia or in the US?
> Tonight, Tonight by Genesis\n\nUnfortunately not. I think it is a bit more modern, 21st Century. 
I think the point of "becoming urban" is pure and simple economics. Urbanization has been going on for some decades now, that's where jobs are, and it will continue to become so if no drastic disasters happen. \n\nWhy would a popular vote have an impact? With popular, each vote is worth the same in the whole country. The only way your argument would be true if people currently live rurally only to have more say in an election. 
Well yeah, only if you buy enough in bulk will the trip be worth it. These taxes are aimed at the regular consumer, who has to decide between e.g. water and a sugar drink in the store. The tax doesn't limit the consumers freedom of choice, but by increasing the price tries to influence the consumer to make the healthier choice.\n\nIt's pretty well established in science in regards to alcohol consumption for example, that regulating price through taxes and availability (e.g. alcohol cannot be sold at night) decreases consumption. 
He is the only streamer I can stand (not that I've watched alot). He eliminates two annoying features I find in most streamers; he edits out all the boring parts while still explaining what's going on (hate long videos where nothing happens/the player just drones out about something obvious), and he keeps his inside jokes/mannerisms to a minimum (really hard to start watching a new streamer who fills his videos with obscure sayings).
Do you have a source? For most countries it is the rich areas that subsidize the poorer areas, so I'm pretty sure it would apply to England too. But if you have a source to back up your claim then I am open to changing my opinion. 
No, and they shrank so much that it was impossible for me to put them on.

Unlikely. Their GDP is 4 trillion, with the federal budget under 1 trillion. No way they could spend such an astronomical amount on refugees.

Also, as you can see from the graph, I doubt anyone has claimed that the unemployment rate has been consistently around 4 % for the entirety of Obamas reign, but it has steadily declined towards 4 %, being 4.9 % a year ago. 
Whoa there, made shit up? Sources? \n\nFor the last month while he's been president, they've continuously called him out on his bullshit, clearly fake lies, like inauguration attendance, electoral wins and an unknown Swedish incident. But made anything up?
Agreed, but it is extremely hard to find that one specific piece of info from them. With text there's usually a TOC or at the very least you can easily skim ahead. 
Well the GPU is really weak and it doesn't have a SSD drive which will make it really slow. Not to mention it tacks on an optical drive, card reader and WiFi-card. I'd just look into building out of components yourself.

I find *the media* to do an OK job for the most part of informing me, i.e. I haven't found this inaccuracy you are talking about. Granted, figuring out how to handle Trump was hard but they found some tools towards the end of the primaries. \n\nFor the record, something is bound to be inaccurately reported, but that is why serious media issue redactments when they see that they have done a story wrong. 
As an european football player and fan, can someone shed some light on the touchdown rules for me? The slomo-replay isn't showed in this link but can be seen from the official NFL YT-channels highlight-reel.\n\nIt shows White going down before the endzone, with the ball going halfway over the white line, half of it still being on the white line. At what point is it considered a touchdown?\n\nCompared to European football where the ball has to cross the goal-line completely in order for the ball to be out of play.\n\nAlso, is the ET in american football always golden goal, whoever scores the first points win? In that case, a field goal would be far too easy IMO, so is it whoever scores the first TD?
Trump specifically mentioned "what happened last night in Sweden". Only [nothing significant happened in Sweden that day](http://www.aftonbladet.se/nyheter/a/Vn17J/in-english-this-happened-in-sweden-friday-night-mr-president).
You should be able to find that out yourself. Check for RAM clearance from Noctua's page, and then see how tall your RAM is. If it's a no go, buy lower RAM. Or simply move the D15 fans to the middle and back, but that is a suboptimal solution. 
Ode an die freude
Yes. Are you implying they are ignoring any legit issues in order to report on another (important issue)? If so, what has been neglected?
But he mentioned Sweden together with Nice, Paris and Brussels, cities which have all suffered from terrorist attacks quite recently. So I think it was a fair conclusion to draw, especially since he referenced one specific incident which apparently happened the day before.
Please tell me more about how Sweden is a stagnant economy? (Not to mention socialist but I don't want to get into that).\n\nSweden is doing economically very well, kinda like the US. GDP growth of Sweden was 4 % in 2015 (2,6 % for US; 1,6 % last year), while the unemployment rate of Sweden is between 6-7 % (compared to a near practical full-employment of 4 % for the US).
Kings of Leon was something that I thought of too, but unfortunately not. 
Yes, the PSU is of the ATX form factor, which the case also accepts. 
Again, what stories?
Yeah, just being honest and giving feedback, thanks for acknowledging it. I understand the need to have a custom theme, but maybe something more neutral (sand?).\n\nAre you saying you're looking into the voting issue? Comments are votable but not the link/self-post. Using the latest Waterfox with RES.
Yeah, VGA needs to die, but I think it's being kept on as legacy because alot of meeting rooms still have VGA input for projectors. 
So who should they fight for? It's not like they can defend they country, the options are either a terrorist organization, or fighting for a dictator.
As I said in another comment, I misspoke. He didn't mention terrorist attacks but that's what I felt he implied. Maybe you could enlighten me as to what incident he referred to?
Not that one either.
And they can't just keep buying those goods?
Holy shit, saying you prefer a consistent conservative senator over a democrat or a businessman with a democratic history yields you 17 downvotes on the conservative subreddit??
I think it is fair to compare GWB and Obama for example, but Trump spits out so many lies that outrageous statements that noone is used to in mainstream politics that I think it is completely fair and expected what kind of backlash it gets. 
Exterminator?\n\nFor Wifi you either need to have a Wifi-enabled motherboard, or if the Mobo is not natively capable of Wifi, some kind of addon that enables Wifi. A PCI(-e) Wifi-card is common though if you are building an ITX machine (the smallest motherboard with room for only one expansion card, the GPU), this is not an option. Another option would be a USB WiFi receiver, though in my experience these are not as reliable as a solid PCI-e expansion card.
Agreed. But putting the whole report together is basically "one persons amount of work", so if you divide the whole report into 4 sections, the fifth person is the editor.\n\nUsually just easier to write it individually, as most assignments are just 2-5 pages. 30-60 page assignments are a whole other beast. 
I think what OP was saying is it needs to be two-sided. 
The performance hit by sharing PCI-e lanes for GPUs is insignificant.
Could you dig those up? Burden of proof is on you IMHO.
Thanks for all the replies! I believe I have actually found the song, though I of course heard the chorus wrong. It is Bruno Mars' [Locked out of Heaven](https://open.spotify.com/track/3w3y8KPTfNeOKPiqUTakBh). Somewhat embarassing..
Not that much IMO. America is a huge place with vastly different climate and the classic staples are universally recognized, so regional specialties don't get recognized.

I have never done it myself, I just suck it up because I am in a similar situation as you; different sizes.

Honest question as a moderate: Why do conservatives hate Obama? Was he for example any worse than typical democrat presidents, or was it just that he was the wrong party? Because I get the feeling that he was special kind of bad.

Agreed, with that salary I'd get your own place as soon as you have the cash to get that place (i.e. deposit and necessary furniture). Just the freedom and quality of life from not living with your parents will be worth it, and since you're renting there are less risks for having to use any emergency funds. Living near your workplace is also a huge improvement in quality of life, in fact if your commute is so short why not bike to work (or public transit, don't know about the possibilities in Kansas City) to save even more money from not using a car, and thus paying off your debt faster. 
HuffPo reported on the pissing incident, CNN and NYT AFAIK only reported that HuffPo were reporting on it, and the source was an actual file that was handed to HuffPo, though its creditibility was and is dubious. Personally wouldn't have reported on it at all, but you can't have everything.

Depends on the transaction. It is not a fee per say, but the business selling you something uses the services of a company to conduct the transaction. You just don't see it in the end price. E.g. online websites uses the software of companies to process bank transfers/card payments, or physical retailers pay a fraction of the price to the credit card company.\n\nBills are different thing yes, as I said.
But the OT is golden goal right? Whoever scores the first point wins? \n\nCompared to winning the coin toss in the regular game, you still have to play all 4 quarters, which evens out the advantage.

Nothing of what you said contradicts what I said. And I don't know what kind of food the US exports and to where.\n\nIgnoring that some people want to buy domestic food, the cheapest typically win, whether it is domestic or imported. So if the *cities* refuse to buy *rural* food, it has to be price (or quality), meaning they have to buy it from abroad. 
It's a decent price but there are some odd component choices there. Are you considering buying it, and for what purposes?
Yes.
That's the job of the media. To scrutinize those in power, see that they are doing lawful acts and inform the electorate so that they can vote to continue giving their representatives their confidence or change them for someone else.

Less than 2000 people? As long as it's 1000 people, it's an excellent sample size. Adding the sample size only adds small amounts of confidence to the survey beyond that. 
But it's pretty easy to one-shot a witch with a shotgun to her head. For dementors, you need incredible mental strength to summon a patronus. :/
It can if enough people vote for it. 
No, that's just false, you clearly have no idea how statistics or polling works. Check this Wikipedia article, with a sample size of 1000 responders you get a margin of error of 3 % units. After that, you get radically diminishing returns meaning there's really no point in polling more people, as that is both time consuming and expensive, while only adding a small portion of reliability to your poll. \n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sample_size_determination#Estimation\n\nIn fact, while UK may have 70 million people, the US has 300 million, and polls there also use a sample size of 1000 for most polls. The margin of error is still the same. 
How does first past the post protect against specifically socialists and communists?\n\nFPTP gudies the vote towards two "fringe" parties, leaving the moderates out. Wouldn't a democracy where the population is proportionately represented make more sense? Look at e.g. the U.K. and how many MPs the UKIP have compared to their share of the vote.
No, but good idea.
These should be posted as the original links TBH.
Yeah, something like little above half the nation supports *a*/some kind of ban. Not the shitshow that was the EO.
How convenient for him to give yet another unsatisfactory explanation afterwards.\n\nHe's the POTUS, why is he still getting his information from the news and not briefings???
You're correct, he didn't mention any attacks. But that's what it feels like he implied, can anyone enlighten me on what he actually meant?\n\nNote that this wasn't what the media said, I just wrote it out of memory. Still waiting to see any of those fake stories. 
TBH it was pretty hard for Obama to work with the congress in his 6 last years since the congress was Republican-controlled and refused to work with him. Which is all the more weird why Trump won't work with the congress now that republicans control pretty much everything.\n\nDid Obama use many EO's in his first two years in the office (apart from conventional ones)?
Actually it was Trump himself who said that something should be done about people registering in two states. 
Given that Trump can't seem to make a single speech or public appearance without lying, and that members of his administration has been caught making up terrorist attacks previously, no, I don't think it is a stretch o assume that he was saying what he meant, or even insinuating that a terrorist attack had taken place (notice that in the context Sweden was mentioned together with other places that have suffered from muslim terrorist attacks recently). \n\nOR you might be inclined to believe he is just spewing out whatever Bannon or someone else whispers in his ear (see his defence about the size of his electoral victory), but then we're putting on the tin foil hat.\n\nAgain, I haven't made up anything, I misspoke about what his exact words were and admitted as much once you corrected me. 
None so far, I'm talking about the fact that he's issuing EO's left and right instead of trying to get them through congress.
Eh, it's simple supply and demand economics. A global, unsubsidized market will direct the production of food etc. to the regions where it is most effective. If there is demand in the US, someone abroad will export to them when the supply and demand meets.

Yeah, figured as much. But TBH as OP is the one asking for advice, I'd expect him to link the build and not me finding out what it currently contains.
[Citation needed] \n\nStill.\n\nBesides, Comey is compromised after his office leaked like a sieve to the Trump campaign.
He doesn't need to specify in his answer. The context is already there *from the question*.
And yet the answer was far more firm, absent that context. It certainly bears worth questioning further, particularly given all the Russia skepticism.\n\nBut more to the point OP's analogy is painfully false given that none of those Democrats are being questioned as to their answers under oath.
question: "But if it’s true, it’s obviously extremely serious, and if there is any evidence that anyone affiliated with the Trump campaign communicated with the Russian government in the course of this campaign, what will you do?" - note that there are no qualifiers - no "to discuss the elections", no "in their role with the campaign" -\n\nparsed out: If [group] [did thing][during time], what will you do?\n\nSo:\nIF [anyone affiliated with the Trump campaign] [communicated with the russian gov][during the course of this campaign], what will you do?\n\nI fail to see how the question implies the context you claim. There is no qualifier, no scope limitations in that question.\n
Well, here's Session's actual words: \n\n> "Senator Franken, I'm not aware of any of those activities. I have been called a surrogate at a time or two in that campaign and **I didn't have — did not have communications with the Russians**, and I'm unable to comment on it."\n\nHe didn't specify any context, just that he didn't have communications with the Russians. Period. End of story. He did not clarify or provide any context indicating that he was referring to one small specific aspect of such a communication.\n\nPerhaps he misspoke. But on its face, it looks like perjury right about now.\n\n[Also, he was asked on a questionnaire:](http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2017/mar/02/context-what-jeff-sessions-told-al-franken-about-m/)\n\n> Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., asked: "Several of the President-elect’s nominees or senior advisers have Russian ties. Have you been in contact with anyone connected to any part of the Russian government about the 2016 election, either before or after election day?"\n> \n> Sessions responded, in total: "No."\n\nAt the very best, he looks foolish. Him recusing himself just adds fuel to the fire.
I really don't care for this line of logic when it comes to defending our side. "Well they did it too" ain't helping anybody. 
certainly propaganda/fabricated pieces are a problem, but the cure is control of the media/content, a cure that is worse than the disease.
Except, he didn't indicate your last sentence at all. He said these words: "I didn't have — did not have communications with the Russians, and I'm unable to comment on it."\n\nYou're giving him the benefit of context he did not provide.\n\nBesides, again, *this is irrelevant to the fact that the OP is a false analogy.* Nobody is criticizing him for meeting with the Russian ambassador. They're criticizing a denial -- perhaps a poorly stated one, who knows -- *under oath* that he communicated with the ambassador.\n\nShow me where these Democrats denied meeting with the Ambassador *under oath* and I'll concede the analogy is accurate.
Context and knowledge is always important. You should never dismiss data that is relevant to the discussion.
From a campaign standpoint sure.  If democrats want to use this to call all republicans hypocrits or whatever that's a great campaign video.  But from a "impeach and or resign from office" standpoint then I disagree.  Which leads me back to the point. Pick the correct battles to against trump with, I don't believe this is it.  \n\nYour first comment said there was no context.  There was, he was asked in the frame of trump surrogates.  If sessions did not meet with the Russians as a campaign surrogate (which he adamantly proclaimed) then he was being truthful.  It doesn't matter if sessions went to the Russian guys birthday party in vegas.  The frame of the question was based around surrogates.  You can't claim he lied under oath.  That is a specific legal benchmark.  Yeah, it's not a good look but even left leaning lawyers are saying this isn't perjury.  This whole discussion is based around the fact that many people think he should resign due to perjury.  When you take the actual context of the question and look at his answer, many people (legal, not just vox opinion board) don't see how it could be actually labeled perjury. 
If you call Giuliani's own words speculation, OK.\n\nhttp://www.cnn.com/2016/11/04/politics/rudy-giuliani-hillary-clinton-email-fbi/\n\n> Blitzer reminded Giuliani that in an October 28 interview on "The Lars Larson Show," the former mayor said he was in contact with former agents **"and a few active agents, who obviously don't want to identify themselves."**\n\nBut, really, do you need a smoking gun like his own words when he's off predicting something precisely that only a leak could have supplied to him?\n\nYes, he changed his story. But only after people started mentioning the Hatch Act. And he was *explicit* in mentioning active agents.

>Several minutes before Schiff spoke to reporters, Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes, R-California, said Comey was "very forthright" and that he had seen "no evidence" of contact between Russian officials and the Trump campaign.\n\nNunes thinks Comey has been forthright, and Nunes has seen no evidence of contact between Russian officials and the Trump campaign.  Comey did not make that claim, Nunes did.

No, they don't "keep telling the democrats there is no Trump Russian connection."  They told them that there was no evidence **so far**, once, in October.

It doesn't matter, his response is impossible to be prosecuted under perjury laws as it fails all 3 of the required 3 tests:\nhttp://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/politics/special/clinton/stories/whreport8.htm
Except the nets actually being good 
Actually it is.  Perjury is exceptionally hard to prove, only 6 people on the last 60 years have been charged with lying to congress.  The fact that the answer is open to interpretation means it would be exceptionally hard to bring charges against and get a conviction.  \n\nAnd if contact with Russians is troubling, what about all the Democrats who had contact with this same Russian? \n\nI dislike trump very much and didn't want him to win, but this is making a mountain out of a molehill.  Pick a different hill to die on, not this one charge that would be exceptionally hard to actually prove.  
http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2017/mar/02/context-what-jeff-sessions-told-al-franken-about-m/ \n\nEdit: if politifact has a hard time calling it lying under oath then it probably wasnt.  They are fairly left leaning, and would be chomping at the bit to call this true. 
Repeating myself from another similar response:\n\n"And yet the answer was far more firm, absent that context. It certainly bears worth questioning further, particularly given all the Russia skepticism.\n\nBut more to the point OP's analogy is painfully false given that none of those Democrats are being questioned as to their answers under oath."
First quote "in that campaign", second "2016 election".  He didn't meet with Russians in regard to "that campaign" or "2016 election".   He meet with them through the normal course of his duties.

Ha! That's great, a Russian stooge calling someone "Bolshevik". Talk about projection...\n\nOh boy, hope the borscht is warm tonight, comrade, it's been fun.
Your source is the Clinton defense team's rebuttals to the Starr report? \n\nBut even using your own source, "Perjury requires proof that a defendant, while under oath, knowingly made a false statement as to material facts."\n\nAnd I don't know where you get the "it's not perjury if your answer is to a question not asked." Your source says, "It is equally beyond debate that the following types of answers are not capable of being false and are therefore by definition non-perjurious:. . .truthful answers to questions that are not asked."\n\nWhat Sessions allegedly did does not fit under the category defended in your source. Your source says truthful answers to questions not asked. Sessions gave an (allegedly) untruthful answer to a question not asked. So unless there's something else, his untruthful answer is still perjury.
Blocked... I have no time for kids. 
> That is no fire to add fuel to. The FBI keeps telling the democrats there is no Trump Russian connection\n\n[citation needed]\n\n> You can believe the fake news media or the Head of the FBI.\n\nWhose agency was leaking like a sieve to the Trump campaign.
So purely speculation on your part? I thought you actually had evidence of something. 
I believe Nunes was just told, again, by Comey that there still is no evidence of any connections between Trump's campaign and Russia.
That was not the question Sessions was asked, but if you still what to believe he told a falsehood so what, it happens all the time in testimony to congress.    
The question *did* specify a context.
>It does help.\n\nHow?  Senatorial meetings with Ambassadors is totally commonplace - that's not the issue.  The problem isn't meeting with Ambassadors; the problem is *lying* about it happening.\n
uhhh, try again...\n\nactually, how did you even *get* that number...?\n\n
Campaigns meet with political world leaders all the time.  Nothing to see here.  You might want to head back to /r/[redacted] with the rest of your Bolshevik friends.   
>Anyone who objectively looks at what he said certainly must have concerns over how he answered the question\n\nAbsolutely not. There was nothing wrong with how Jeff Sessions answered the question. He was being asked a specific question about the Trump campaign and gave a specific answer. This is just the latest of the democrat temper tantrum/soft coup against Trump.
The point is to show that until recently this was a relatively mundane and expected event.  Now you are expected to disclose every occasion on which you've drank a shot of vodka.
All I see is that *truthfully* answering a question that wasn't asked isn't perjury, but I don't see anything that protects people who give a *false* answer to an unasked question.\n\n>It is equally beyond debate that the following types of answers are not capable of being false and are therefore by definition non-perjurious: ... **truthful** answers to questions that are not asked, see, e.g., United States v. Corr, 543 F.2d 1042, 1049 (2d Cir. 1976)\n\n(emphasis mine)\n\nAdmittedly, I skimmed most of the article, so I may have just missed the part you're referring to.
Besides, the problem wasn't meeting with the Russian ambassador, the problem was failing to disclose it while under oath.  If you're going to use the "well they did it too" argument, at the very least, get the "it" right...
> The fact that the answer is open to interpretation means it would be exceptionally hard to bring charges against and get a conviction.\n\nThat also makes it a valid thing to question. And it makes the OP a false analogy and a false equivalence.
Wow! How many denied meeting him under oath?
the thing is smiley wasn't even asking Sessions about his own behavior.  \n\n\nit boils down to:  \n\n"There have been reports that Trump's surrogates have had contact with Russian officials.  If that's true, what will you do?"\n\n"I did not have communications with the Russians and am unaware of anyone who has."\n\nSessions offered that apropos of nothing and it was a lie.  if he's found to have committed perjury, then he did it to himself for no reason.  he could have said nothing.
[removed]
I'm very disappointed with the "support the team" attitude of both sides, but it falls to conservatives now. Anyone who objectively looks at what he said certainly must have concerns over how he answered the question. Regardless if it is a big deal or not (and it's probably not), he did technically lie under oath. This is not something anyone should be okay with.
But, allegedly, no wrong was done. Both sides do it. They do it in their capacity as state officials. Why is meeting with foreign ambassadors all of the sudden considered taboo?\n\nYou're line of thinking is wrong, quite frankly. Show wrong doing, and then we can have a discussion.
Nunes just said it again today, Comey told him again, there's no evidence of any Russia + Trump connection.\n\nI guess the Dems want to continue humiliating themselves. The final report is going to be a ballbuster.
>I really don't care for this line of logic when it comes to defending our side. "Well they did it too" ain't helping anybody.      \n\nIt does help. It shows that high level politicians meeting ambassadors of other countries is a perfectly normal standard practice and always has been.         \n\nThis is a main reason why the ambassadorship role exists in the first place.     
That's not how perjury works. If you answer a question that's not asked, you cannot be held liable for perjury legally. There are so many keyboard leftist lawyers roaming around here lately it's insane:\nhttp://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/politics/special/clinton/stories/whreport8.htm
Even though your calling me an idiot, I have to say I like your flair. It's legit 
I'm not suggesting he would meet the legal test for perjury, and I never have. Perjury hasn't even been mentioned in this chain...\n\nHowever, I am saying that his answer was misleading when interpreted in the most favorable light (and as an attorney, he should know far better), and a flat out lie at worst.\n\nFurther, I am getting rather annoyed at people claiming that the context or the question implied that he was limiting the scope of his response. That simply is not the case at all.
This is not the thing they are pissy about though. This is just kind of muddying the water. What is much more damning and should be investigated is whether team Obama set the meetings up.
What did the FBI leak to the Trump campaign?
"It probably wasn't" is not a particularly great defense to a charge of potential criminal perjury -- particularly when the implications of any Russian contact at this point are troubling.\n\nAgain, none of those Democrats were asked under oath about this. The OP is a false analogy.
That is no fire to add fuel to. The FBI keeps telling the democrats there is no Trump Russian connection and they keep running to the press saying the FBI is hold back information.  You can believe the fake news media or the Head of the FBI.     
Damn, but this sounds familiar... mind providing a source for Comey stating that there is no Trump-Russia connection this time?\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/5xc17u/a_total_hypocrite_trump_calls_for_immediate/deh1l42/
Dude that is nothing there..  Nothing.  Show one piece of actual evidence.   
> that there was no evidence so far\n\nThat literally means the exact same thing. Logic dictates that claims without evidence are dismissed.\n\nTo give some examples\n\nWe have not found evidence that Obama is a time traveling robot **So far**\n\nWe have not found evidence that Hillary Clinton is a lizard person **So far**\n\n Do you believe the above two statements should be treated the same as the current Situation? By what your statement suggests, if you stay true to the logic you are currently using, then you have to.\n\nThis is the burden of proof/argument from ignorance fallacy at its finest, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argument_from_ignorance\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophical_burden_of_proof\n\n> in some circumstances it can be safely assumed that if a certain event had occurred, evidence of it could be discovered by qualified investigators. In such circumstances it is perfectly reasonable to take the absence of proof of its occurrence as positive proof of its non-occurrence.\n\n> Copi, Introduction to Logic (1953), p. 95\n\n

I cheated. I used an online [inertia calculator] (http://www.calctown.com/calculators/moment-of-inertia-of-disk) which uses I = m * r^2 / 2. I plugged in 2.27 kg (~5 lbs) and 0.457 m (~18" radius) and got I = 0.237 kg-m^2.\n\nI double checked the result using a calculator after reading your comment. I then did a reality check using an online [flywheel energy calculator](http://www.botlanta.org/converters/dale-calc/flywheel.html) which showed 81 Joules of kinetic energy stored at 250 RPM. This decently matched the Watt-seconds (79.8) delivered by the motor to the load.\n\nThanks for taking the time to question my work, I always worry I screwed up somehow. Can you step me through your derivation to see where our results diverge?\n\nEDIT: Our answers differ by a factor of 4. Any chance you used a 9" radius instead of 18"? I got 18" from OP's comment above:\n>so attached to the motor shaft I want to put a 5lb disc radius 1.5 ft.\n\n\n

Hard to say unless you define the max speed needed, how much torque and a guess at the load moment of inertia (approximate diameter, length and mass).
The 7812 requires the input voltage be 3V higher than the output voltage. You need at least 15VDC on the input to get a regulated 12VDC output. You may need to get a low drop-out (LDO) regulator to get 12VDC regulated from a 13.5VDC input.\n\nA simple circuit would be a comparator that operates a p-channel MOSFET in series with your regulator input.

I saw the comment and thought it was a good one.\n\nI misread the graph. The 0.5A fuse shows it opens in about 12 seconds at 1A and about 800ms at 2A. Note the graph is log-log. The selected fuse is featured as a "transient tolerant fuse" which is another way of saying it's not a fast blow type.\n\nYour limits are 220ms at 2A and the fuse must't blow ever a 200mA. The fuse you chose must be more than 200mA but less than 2A and it must not blow in less than 220ms at 2A.\n\nThis manufacturer has good datasheets so I prefer to design-in their fuses when something other than a 'don't let it catch on fire' fuse is needed.\n\nI'd cover all bases (the DRV110) by putting the fuse directly from the +48VDC supply to your circuitry if your circuit is as drawn because you don't show a bypass cap from +48 to GND.\n\nIf you include a bypass cap in your circuit, place the fuse in series to your solenoid. This is to prevent the fuse from blowing from the capacitor charge current (current drawn while cap charges from 0V to 48V).\n\nNeedless to say but each solenoid circuit gets its own fuse.
Try these half-bridge [n-MOSFET gate drivers](http://www.onsemi.com/pub/Collateral/NCP5104-D.PDF). Build two half bridges, put your motor between the bridge outputs and drive the IN inputs with complimentary (one 'true' the other inverted) PWM signals from your Arduino.

Leaded solder joints should always look shiny. 'Frosted' ones are proof not enough flux was used or the iron was way too hot. I like to use AIM no-clean solder paste (NC293+) to augment the flux in the solder wire. Use a Q-Tip or your index finger as an applicator.\n\n>..soldering tips don't stay tinned very long.\n\nIt's a common problem. I use a JBC temperature-controlled soldering station which senses when the handpiece is in its holder and reduces the temperature to 100^o C. It warms back up to the set operating temperature in 2 or 3 seconds when the handpiece is removed from its holder. This greatly limits tip solder oxidation.\n\nElectronics soldering tips have a copper core plated with iron and then tin. Never file, gouge or use sandpaper on the tip. Breaking through the iron plating reveals the copper core and copper dissolves in molten solder which ruins the tip. Good soldering tip hygiene is use the lowest temperature possible to do what you need and completely re-wet the tip with solder before you put the iron away. I like to leave a blob of solder on the tip before I turn it off. \n\n

A disk 36" in diameter weighing 5 lb has a 0.234 kg-m^2 moment of inertia. This means 0.234 Nm of torque will accelerate the disk at 1 rad/sec^2\n\nAfter unit conversion, this means disk speed increases by 0.289 RPM per second per oz-in torque.\n\n250 RPM in 1 second requires 863 oz-in torque, 86.3 oz-in gets you 250 RPM in 10 seconds, etc. In terms of motor power output, 160 Watts gets 250 RPM in 1 second, 16 Watts gets 250 RPM in 10 seconds, etc.\n\nYou can reasonably expect to get 150 to 200W mechanical at 5,000 RPM and 50 oz-in continuous torque from a NEMA-23 size (2.25" dia.) motor:\n\n[motor example](http://www.automationtechnologiesinc.com/products-page/nema23-m-dc-servo-motor/skewed-rotor-design-nema23-dual-shaft)\n\nThe motor must be geared down from 5,000 RPM to 250 RPM or a 20:1 ratio. Leave a little wiggle-room and use a 16:1 ratio.\n\nAt a 16:1 ratio you'll have 600 oz-in torque (75% gearing efficiency) which will accelerate your disk from 0 to 250 RPM in a minimum of 1.5 seconds.\n\nPeak mechanical output power will be 148W and assuming a motor/drive efficiency of 70%, 210 Watts electrical input power.

I'd be comfortable with  that.\n\n>.. is this a scenario where I'd use like 3 caps in parallel with the supply..\n\nNot really. That scenario is for situations where you need orders of magnitude frequency bypassing. Every capacitor has a series self-resonant frequency at which it has the lowest impedance, above that frequency the impedance increases and the impedance versus frequency curve looks like 'V' on a log scale. Let's say the self-resonant frequences are 1 MHz for a 1uF cap, 10 MHz for a 100nF cap and 100 MHz for a 10nF cap. When you parallel the caps, the 'V' shaped curves overlap and combine to form a 'U' shaped low impedance over a 3 decade frequency range.\n\nYour circuit draws a PWM 200mA current at maybe 20kHz. That's 0mA then 200mA repeated every 50us from your 48V source. Let's say your goal is to limit the voltage ripple to 1V so you need to calculate what size capacitor would lose 1V in 25us (50us / 2)  with a 200mA discharge current. Doing violence to a differential equation by treating it like an algebraic expression gives you:\n\nC = i * dt / dv = 200mA * 25us / 1V  = 500nF.\n\nMake the bypass cap a 1uF / 100V MLCC (multi-layer ceramic capacitor) and call it a day.

>..there needs to be legislation in place to increase production of renewable energy sources.\n\nRenewable energy is subsidized up to the hilt and still it can't compete. You need accept green energy is and always will be unsustainable economically.  \n\nYes, climate change is a real *good* thing.
> Aren't economical vehicles a good thing?\n\nIt's not a good thing when you have no choices, when the government and environmentalists decide what's good for you.
I'm trying to get my head around the vision of currents driving [currants](http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3187/2687185793_273e57929e_o.jpg)\nfrom the warm gulf to the cold north sea. :-P
A good idea is to place the bypass caps right after you place your ICs on your pcb layout. Place the other parts after that and then route the circuit traces to work around the bypass caps. This puts you in the correct mindset that bypass caps take precedence.\n\nGeneral rule: If it has a Vdd or Vcc pin, put a bypass cap on it. \n\nFor really fast circuits (FPGAs, MCUs) use 3 MLCC (multi-layer ceramic caps) in parallel (1uF, 100nF, 10nF). Have a bulk bypass capacitor (aluminum electrolytic) 10uF to 100uF somewhere on the board.
>“It is a defect that kerosene is so irrationally cheap, which triggers much unnecessary air travel,” he writes. “A worldwide tax on kerosene–if at all politically possible–should be something to pursue.”\n\nPoor leftists, they don't have the faintest understanding of economics. This individual feels "kerosene is irrationally cheap" and must believe kerosene (AKA jet fuel in this country) is being sold for less than it costs to produce. He can't understand it's cheap because oil is cheap and plentiful.\n\nWould you want this Leftist decide you if your trip is necessary or not? Leftist parasites don't know how to earn money but they sure think it's their right tell you how you should spend yours. 
Does the left really believe they'll get what they want by this means when they couldn't get it at the ballot box? They are just marginalizing themselves with these antics.
LOL and touché!
I talk to my grandkids about global warming when they have questions. I tell them there are some bad people in the world who want to scare you about nature and make you afraid. We did the same when our kids were little and I'm proud they are skeptics today who can think critically and independently.
> the models get closer and closer to the truth.\n\nAre they really? I see no evidence of that.
Unless I'm missing something it looks like your MOSFET source goes to +12V and the drain goes to GND. This shorts out your 12V supply when when you apply power.\n\nDo this: MOSFET source to GND, MOSFET drain to solenoid coil, other end of solenoid coil to +12V. !N4001 cathode to +12V, anode to MOSFET drain. Use a faster reverse recovery time diode than a 1N4001 if you plan to PMW the coil.
Thanks. Use the URL but strip it back to .com and save it. It's a great source to identify markings on SOT-23 size SMD silcon devices.

Your motor has a continuous torque rating limit which is independent of speed, it's the same at 1 RPM or 3,000 RPM. Go over the limit and you will burn out your motor.\n\nMotor torque is proportional to motor current. Your motor is rated at 8 Amps so that is your maximum current, go above that for longer than a  minute or two and motor damage will occur. \n\nPower is speed times torque. Your motor develops 3,000 times more power at 3,000 RPM than it does at 1 RPM.\n\nGearing trades in unneeded speed for needed torque. There is no way around these limits.\n\nFigure out what is the wheel RPM at the fastest speed you want to go at. Divide your rated motor RPM by your wheel RPM and that will give you the gear reduction ratio you need to get the maximum power from your motor. In many instances toothed belt and pulley reduction gearing will do and it's cheap. A 5:1 reduction is a practical maximum. 
I agree with everything you say. That's where a 350MHz scope comes in to note the ringing frequency of ripple on the Vdd power distribution plane to ground plane. Sometimes just changing the MLCC vendor is enough to attenuate the problem. Putting caps on the bottom side of the board works wonders but we avoid doing so for economic reasons if an acceptable component-side solution works.
First impression: Not bad for a first attempt. Too much solder, not enough flux and maybe the iron is a little too hot. The solder joints aren't shiny, are you using lead-free solder?\n\nSuggestions: 1mm solder wire is too big for this kind of work, 0.5mm diameter is much better. Use 63/37 rosin core leaded solder wire because it wets much better and has 50^o C lower eutectic temperature. Use a conical soldering iron tip with a 0.2 to 0.3mm dia at the pointy end. Make sure the tip is dressed (solder-wetted) at all times and clean the tip frequently with a moist sponge. Avoid leaving the iron 'on' for long periods (>5 min) when you aren't using it. 
A 10th one might be 'Wishing Something Makes It Real'. Leftists want global warming and global warming scientists make their wishes come true. Data is manipulated, adjusted and homogenized until it conforms to leftist wishes.

>Man-made climate change happens. Man-made climate change kills a lot of people. It’s going to kill a lot more. We have laws on the books to punish anyone whose lies contribute to people’s deaths. It’s time to punish the climate-change liars.\n\nI'll bet not one person was persuaded to the global warming side by this kind of rhetoric. More likely it tipped fence-sitters towards climate skepticism.
Common leftist ploy: Use the guilt by association smear.\n\nLet's try using your ploy with global warming:\n\n"I was distracted from anything you said about climate change by Jill Stein saying sea level will rise 10 feet by 2050. Apparently global warming alarmists are nuts."  \n\n 
>Instead of learning the lessons of 2016 and speaking directly to the concerns of American workers – particularly in the industrial Midwest – the Environmentalist Left is doubling-down on an extreme, anti-human agenda.

Orr exposed them for 48 hours to experimentally induced under-saturated water that he predicted would occur in the future around Antarctica due to rising atmospheric CO2. All specimens survived.
Stepper is the simplest and cheapest solution. DC motors require closed-loop feedback (quadrature encoder) and require a servodrive while steppers are open-loop positioners. DC motors need reduction gearing because they are low-torque, high-RPM motors compared to steppers.

Sandpaper is definitely out.

Don't clean the tip with steel wool at your electronics work bench; we ban steel wool from the production and assembly area.

OK, 2ft-lbs is 384 in-oz so you need a NEMA-34 size motor (600 to 900 in-oz rated). Your speed is very low (about 67 full-steps per second) so you can use a 1 to 2A rated motor with a 24VDC power supply.\n\nAll but the cheapest drives are microsteppers now and a 16 microstep drive can move the motor to 3,200 different locations per revolution. 1,067 step pulses per second will move the motor at exactly 20.00625 RPM so that's close enough.\n\nSay you have 5 rockets. Issue 640 step pulses, do your launch thing, issue another 640 step pulses, etc. That's pretty much all there's to it.

Unless you propose that we eliminate all taxes, we have to take somebody's money. Hopefully we can take money in a way that maximizes fairness and minimizes economic disruption. \n\nEither there's some reason that heirs should be exempt, or we should consider whether taking money from workers, entrepreneurs, and investors is more or less fair than taking it from heirs. "It is theirs" clearly doesn't work, since that applies to everyone else too.

"Protected class" really means "attribute based on which discrimination is illegal." Right now those attributes include race and sex, so it's illegal to fire somebody based on their race or sex. Sexual orientation is not protected, so it's legal to fire somebody for being gay (except where a local or state law protects sexual orientation).\n\nThis goes both ways. It is illegal to fire a man just because he's a man, or a white person just because they're white. The term "protected class" is a bit misleading because everybody belongs to a protected class multiple times over.

I don't want to be too dismissive of the fact that self control is hard.

If Twitter doesn't want to do something themselves, you assume they want it to be illegal for everyone? Seriously?\n\nI think you're trying to conflate two related but distinct concepts in the minds of the public.

The other is the social expectation that people should be able to say what the want on open (but privately owned) platforms without interference from the owner.\n\nI agree with the second one, but the first one is so much more important that I don't like taking about them as if they're basically the same. Edit: even using the same label of "free speech" for both goes too far for me.

Join your local branch of the Democratic party. You might be too late for this cycle, but every 2-4 years they'll modify or rewrite their platform, and you can propose an amendment to add support for a universal basic income. They might also endorse and then campaign for candidates in the primaries, and you can try to get them to endorse candidates who support UBI. These local groups are often small enough that just a couple vocal supporters can make a real difference.
Some of them have a real SSN but their work visa has expired.

Maybe they were just more concerned about Hillary killing brown people in foreign countries than about Trump stripping away the rights of brown people and women in America.

I mean, they *are* entitled to pass whatever tariffs they want, just as we are. That's how sovereignty works.\n\nThe issue is that (in most cases) tariffs were originally lowered/repealed as part of a free trade agreement or other negotiation. If we no longer adhere to the agreements we made, they have an excuse to raise their own import barriers, and foreign governments would feel pressure from their domestic industries to do so.\n\nIf other countries aren't adhering to their side of such agreements, I would rather raise a dispute through the WTO to pressure them into reducing their import restrictions, rather than jumping straight to raising our own. Free trade makes us better off overall, we should try very hard to keep it in place.
I would prefer an international agreement, but I'll take what I can get.\n\nThe tax cut for manufacturers is intended to mitigate the job losses you refer to. Even so, the Seattle area has historically low levels of unemployment (under 4%). While the jobs might not be as good as factory jobs, there is plenty of work available if factories do shut down.

They were just right-wing voters. Our disagreement with them is in the realm of (relatively subjective) values.\n\nNader voters agreed that Bush shouldn't win, but disagreed on the best tactics, or refused to consider tactics. They were just objectively wrong on that front, so it's a lot easier to blame them.
>and gave them all billions of dollars\n\nAnd then the banks paid it all back, plus ~$15 billion more.\n\nThe problem with TARP was government intervention in the free market. The cost to taxpayers was nonexistent, they actually benefited financially.

No, it won't stop manufacturing from moving overseas. I just don't think it's the government's job to save an industry. If overseas factories are polluting and letting workers die on the job, those issues should be addressed on the basis of environmentalism and workers' rights, not for the sake of American industry.\n\nIf Americans are losing or can't get good jobs, we should focus on education and training for those who can adapt, and a stronger social safety net for those who can't. Unemployment and underemployment have been steadily decreasing for almost seven years now (https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/U6RATE), and wages are starting to go up again. We don't need to bring back manufacturing to provide Americans with good jobs.
I'm not even saying that, I think we need to do an investigation to determine that. I'm just trying to understand what you're saying above.

You said it's already underway, i.e. that those politicians or their allies have succeeded in getting white people to slow their reproduction. If they have accomplished that, I'd call them pretty powerful.\n\nI'm confused because I've literally never met a white person who thinks they should have fewer kids because they're white. I've seen like 3 examples of it online, but there are hundreds of millions of other white Europeans out there. Surely if it was such a pervasive sentiment, it would be spoken about more openly?\n\nIt just seems like a really ineffective strategy, and I'm simultaneously skeptical that anyone would bother to try it and that it would actually work. I think declining birthrates are more easily explained in other ways.
I'm not sure why you think criticizing something and supporting it as the best available option are mutually exclusive. I'd like environmental groups to endorse the initiative while explaining its shortfalls and working to correct them ASAP, rather than letting carbon emissions continue unchecked while they wait for something better.\n\nAnd no, I'm not concerned about falling out of the cool kids' club, I'm concerned about doing real harm to marginalized groups by voting for this measure. If other progressives refused to endorse it because they figured out that it will cause problems that I hadn't considered, I would like to hear about those problems.

Obviously this isn't a neutral source, but the I-732 campaign claims $2.2B in new revenue and $2.2B in tax cuts ($1.5B sales tax, $450M business tax, and $250M for the working families rebate).\n\nhttps://yeson732.org/tax-swap-overview/\n\nHere's a third party source that claims a small shortfall, but one well within the range of forecasting uncertainty: http://www.sightline.org/2016/08/02/does-initiative-732-carbon-tax-have-a-budget-hole/\n\nEven if a major budget shortfall is a certainty, I would much rather pass this initiative now and pass a tax increase later (or establish a progressive state income tax!) to make up the difference. Climate change is an emergency, worrying about deficit spending at a time like this just seems so absurd to me.\n\nEdit: Just checked bond yields. Washington state can borrow for 10 years at under 2.5%. After inflation that's an incredibly cheap loan. We have time to figure out revenue.

"Spoiling" in this context is a technical term in voting theory that means more than just "making somebody lose." It refers specifically to the defect in first-past-the-post voting that causes moderately successful third party candidacies to hurt the major party candidate their supporters oppose the least.\n\nYes, you can be mad at right-wing voters for voting for right-wing candidates, but that's not the same as spoiling the vote.

It's not some feminist conspiracy.\n\nAnd no, wikipedia was never about trying to get get away from "ivory tower bullshit." Their mission is just about making information accessible to everyone. Since they can't afford to hire subject matter experts on every field of human knowledge, they depend on reliable third-party sources to determine what does and does not belong in their encyclopedia.
Isn't Trump also proposing a big government program (a new tax) designed to help manufacturing workers who can't adapt? Tariffs will raise prices for consumers and hurt business for export industries in order to give a benefit to manufacturing. Is that really any different from taxing Americans and successful American industries to give money to the people who used to work in manufacturing?\n\nI only want the safety net to be used to help the people who are too old for job training to be cost effective (like if they're just a couple years from retirement anyway), physically disabled, or borderline mentally disabled and just incapable of doing another job. I just think your criticism is a tad hypocritical.
Right libertarians don't necessarily align more with Clinton than Trump, especially given the way Clinton has been framed as an authoritarian socialist warmonger by her various political opponents.\n\nI can't imagine many members of the Green party thought Trump would be better than Clinton though, unless they're accelerationists.
>wikipedia getting pissy about someone using the medium the way it was intended to be used\n\nWikipedia intended to have articles based on tumblr and shitty blogspam? Seriously?
Isn't this the stereotypical "way too expensive" thing? I'm pretty sure people already knew this.
But the commenter above was just saying a bubble is nice while it lasts, not that it's creating real growth.
Those politicians are saying that white people will become minorities, but that can happen without removing any white people (e.g. by accepting a number of non-white immigrants larger than the existing white population).\n\nSo I ask you again, are white people being removed from Europe, and if so, how?
I tried and failed to kill myself years ago.\n\nWhile recovering in the hospital, three different psychiatrists evaluated me. Two of them recommended outpatient care, but the third one wanted me temporarily committed to a facility. The other two won out and I was released when my physical injuries were treated.\n\nAfter that, I knew if I killed myself then that one psych would be proven right, and since I didn't particularly like her, I couldn't have that.\n\nI haven't killed myself for 9 years, despite never *really* getting over the thoughts, so it seems to be an effective strategy.
Yes.\n\nI'm assuming your argument is as follows\n\n* The government existed before the IRS\n* The IRS collects taxes\n* Therefore, the government existed before taxes\n\nThe flaw in your argument is that the government collected taxes before the IRS was established, just through other agencies. You can't conclude that the government can exist without taxes just because it existed without the IRS.
I want a beautiful game that fully utilizes my new gaming PC. What's today's Crysis? Preferably some kind of story-driven action/adventure, but a more traditional shooter will do.
Birth rates are lower, sure. How did they intentionally lower them?
Oh wow, I swear I was just trying to be helpful when I posted that. Sorry if it came across as snark.
Pretty sure that was sarcasm.
Sure, but drawing the conclusion that he should have faith from that experience is more illogical than drawing the conclusion to have faith from holy texts that (more or less) explicitly tell you to have faith.\n\nAfter a traumatic experience like that, it's perfectly logical to conclude that many particular gods don't exist. However, it does not follow that no god can exist, and that you can take it on faith (i.e. that logic and reason need not be consulted in the matter).
Have you ever gone to an emergency room? Unless you're actively dying, it's already just as slow as the DMV.
Uh, did you miss the Sanders candidacy? Almost half of the Democratic base believes the economy is shit for average people.
Even if you ignore particulate pollution, doesn't NG have a smaller carbon footprint than coal for the same amount of power generation? I'd happily swap all our coal plants for NG while we work toward truly clean solutions.
Right, but the FBI director can't establish case law by just saying something in a public statement, only a judge's courtroom decision can do that.
>is by all accounts of intl law a war criminal\n\nYou have no idea what a war crime is, do you?\n\nI'll help you out: Attacking a country is not a war crime. Launching drone strikes does not constitute a war crime. Causing collateral damage, while tragic, is not a war crime.\n\nTargeting the civilian family members of opposition fighters? That's a war crime. Guess which candidate supports that?
He might not know for sure, but he might be thinking that a 50/50 chance of Hillary following through is better than the certainty that Donald will push as hard as he can in the other direction.
They just grabbed a cookie-cutter response from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Template_messages/User_talk_namespace to discourage OP from trying again, since OP clearly has no idea how to vet sources according to wikipedia's [standards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Identifying_reliable_sources). They didn't carefully choose each word to tailor their response to this particular situation.
I can empathize with people who are selfish. Refusing to donate money because you'd rather spend it on yourself, or refusing to donate a kidney while you're alive because you might need a spare at some point makes sense because everyone values their own wants and needs.\n\nKeeping your organs when you're dead doesn't help you at all though, you're fucking dead. The only reason not to is to spite the living. That's not selfishness, that's just pure, unadulterated assholery.
>  If it's a utilitarian argument (as you state) to deign to white moderates' demands so they can use their power to enact change, what is that other than the perpetuation of white supremacy?\n\nIt's saving black lives?
I'm sorry, but this still seems extremely far-fetched to me.\n\nYou're claiming that:\n\n* There is a powerful group of people who want to get rid of white people\n* They are telling white people that they are oppressors in order to get white people to have fewer white kids\n* Hundreds of millions of white Europeans took this seriously and have had fewer kids as a result\n\nIs that right?\n\n
> Progressives are split on I-732.\n\nYeah, sorry if I exaggerated progressive opposition a bit. Brady Walkinshaw supports it, and while he didn't get Bernie's endorsement like Jayapal did, he's clearly a progressive as well.\n\nIn addition to its supporters, other groups like the 43rd district Democrats had internal disagreements and didn't endorse either way. 
They don't, but the commenter above said it would make gun ownership more expensive overall. That seems like it would make gun ownership and use rarer.\n\nThe small magazine thing seems like a political prop to pass the ammunition background check.
They do pay taxes, to the tune of [$11.6 billion/year](http://itep.org/itep_reports/2016/02/undocumented-immigrants-state-local-tax-contributions-1.php#.WDSllcwrKCh), or around 8% of their income. It's hard to find precise numbers, but comparable legal residents pay about 13% of their income in taxes.\n\nBy far the easiest way to get them to pay their full tax obligation would be to hand them a social security number and a work visa, but obviously not everyone would be too happy about that.
Yeah, Western science is completely (and often rudely) dismissive of Western mysticism (Christian miracles, alternative medicine, etc.). I don't see why African science would or should be any more respectful toward African mysticism.
The kids did absolutely nothing to earn that money, I have very little sympathy for their plight.
She used a hypothetical straight woman as an example, but there was no indication that she believed the issue was exclusive to straight women.
What are some good movies or TV shows that aren't awkward to watch with parents?
Disliking Trump because he's made a number of racist remarks makes me a SJW?\n\nI guess I'm a SJW.
Oh, you're just a moron. That makes much more sense.\n\nThanks for clearing that up!
In Florida there were around 100,000 Nader votes. The most conservative estimates I've found say that 60% of Nader supporters preferred Gore to Bush, meaning Gore lost 60,000 votes to Nader, while Bush only lost 40,000.\n\nBush won Florida by around 500 votes. The 20,000 net votes Gore would have received without Nader in the race would have easily handed him the state and the election. Even if the Nader campaign had increased turnout by an astounding 10x among his supporters, the remaining 2000 net votes would still have been able to flip the result.\n\nThat's the definition of spoiling an election. You can despise the FPTP voting system and the way that it punishes people who try to branch out into more than two parties, but you can't just deny the fact that the spoiler effect is a real thing that happens, sometimes with terrible results.
My grandparents helped my parents get set up in life with the (implied) condition that they would do the same for my generation of the family, and I am expected to do the same for my kids.\n\nObviously I have no legal right to their money, but this arrangement makes all of our lives a helluva lot easier.
Couldn't they just not ask for their gender?
>She messaged him, saying she was only looking for someone to come over to install her air conditioner, making it very clear it wasn’t a date.\n\nI have no problem with this. If a guy wants to install her air conditioner thinking it will somehow get him a date, that's on him.
I'd hesitate to call it "anti free speech" as long as they're ok with other websites hosting that content. A person who doesn't want to get an abortion but is ok with it being legal for others generally isn't called "anti-abortion."\n\nThey're doing something wrong, particularly since they portray themselves as an open forum but don't actually behave like one. Until they call for government action of some kind I don't think it's an issue of free speech though.
So you're fine with Trump?
Uh, black people have faced issues long before the 80s. Slavery and segregation are pretty big ones, and they were quite explicitly anti-black.
Yes, it's more illogical.\n\nArguing for the existence of god using faith is basically circular reasoning, but at least it's a complete circle: Faith tells you that your holy text is true, and your holy text tells you to have faith.\n\nFor your atheist, half of that circle is missing. Faith tells him that there is no god, but there's nothing to make him believe he should have faith.
I completed the interview, but turned them down. This may be a little too salty, but anyway:\n\nTheir interview process is a joke. I applied, and received an e-mail back very quickly. I told the hiring manager I was surprised by their fast response, and would not be able to start until a week later. They said that was fine, but they cancelled my application. E-mails were un-returned for weeks, and I didn't get any response on it until I messaged them on Skype.\n\nThe interviewee feigned understanding on a certain part, so I decided to spend a little more time on it. I was quoted a lower salary as a result.\n\nI adjusted my style to their preferred method, and had very positive feedback on my second demo. The salary is not changed after the first one however. The instructor said I was great, and she sent me very positive feedback. I then received another piece of feedback a few days later that was overwhelmingly negative. I don't know which one was for me.\n\nIt may be a good opportunity, but they don't seem to know what they're doing. Hopefully someone who works for them has a better experience.
Can only speak for Thailand since I'm there now.\n\nIt's possible, but I wouldn't recommend it. You'll either be somewhere very remote that can't afford better, or scraping by in Bangkok. You'll also likely be working illegally, as they're very reluctant to give work permits for anything less than a Bachelors. That means visa runs every few months.\n\nI think you'd be better off in China, or finishing your degree. Your options will expand 100 fold.
It looks like you're comparing SoE only to SoM, aka Seiken Densetsu 2. I agree that game has its flaws, especially in its combat system. Magically especially, is waaay too easy to abuse and charging weapons is tedious. The alchemy system in SoE would be alright, except finding ingredients was incredibly frustrating and time consuming, to the point where I never wanted to use it.\n\nHowever, I think Seiken Densetsu 3 fixed these issues, and just overall greatly improved the series. While the characters in SoM were shallow, SoE's I felt were bone dry. The dog especially has no personality at all, he/she is just "there". SD3 greatly improved on the characters and story with branching paths that all intertwined in certain ways.\n\nAs far as the music and art, I guess that really is a matter of opinion. Both look quite good, just a different style. Not that the music of SoE is bad by any means, but I think the soundtrack of SoM (Not SD3) is one of the best on the SNES.
There's also an xposed module available.
I moved to Asia to teach English. There is a massive, massive demand and not nearly enough people. If you want a job in Thailand, we're always looking.\n\nProbably not the answer you wanted to hear, but hey.
Definitely not advised. If they find it, you will be arrested.
Dtac, True, and AIS are the big 3. To be honest they're all comparable and should be fine.
All great advice here. Go for a CELTA at that price, or spend $30 for an online one. Spending that much money on an unregulated TEFL is a waste.
You're getting downvoted but I think you have a valuable perspective, and should post it in the thread. However, I think you are (perhaps unintentionally) supporting the OPs point. Construction is often an unskilled position, so illegal immigration does drive down these wages.
I suppose it depends on what you mean by "people". Electoral votes yes. And while I agree with you, at the time of posting the popular vote looks to be in Clinton's favor. Like nearly everything in politics, there is a middle ground.
It's not that being on time, and those extra 5 minutes of knowledge will make the final exam so much easier. It's more about associating education with "Okay, this is something important, and I need to be serious about it."\n\nIt sounds like you are trying, which is the first step to succeeding.
Absolutely. As I responded in the other comment, I am in no way saying "this is the best system". But I think it is misleading for the OP to equate the type of freedoms (or lack thereof) in Thailand to far more oppressive systems.
Thailand: I'm an expat living here, and most people do not care or know anything about American politics.\n\nFor those that do, in my experience they think America made a stupid mistake. Thailand's government has had a history of corruption charges. They're used to politicians just taking what they want and giving nothing back. In America, there was a candidate who actually wanted to give people something (Hillary), so it's a little unfathomable that people would choose otherwise.
If you get in a tuk tuk, you're a chump. They are always at least 3x the price of a taxi. Not to mention far less safe.
Ekkamai District, Bangkok
I really encourage anyone near Shanghai to make the trip up to Nanjing to see the memorial and museum there. It is an experience I will remember for the rest of my life.\n\nHow anyone could ever doubt it happened is beyond me.
(Biased since I'm a Cincinnatian)\n\nI think this is just short of being a great flag. If they took out everything in the middle of the C, it would be far less busy and appealing. Still, could be worse.
Whoah, I don't usually respond but there's a lot to unpack here.\n\nI agree with what you said, that snarky comments are not usually helpful. However, these students have already gone through the regular disciplinary process, so I had to work with what I had. The educational system does its darndest to put all students into one big group, with a singular learning style. Anyone who has been a teacher for more than 5 minutes can tell you that's bogus. Some students respond to humor, some to discipline, some to group work, some to moving around, and every other color of the rainbow inbetween.\n\nYou may see your problems as insurmountable, but I promise you they're not. It's easy for me to be a keyboard warrior and say "be on time", but you seriously need to be on time. However much time you think you need, add 5 minutes. Then another 5. And another 5 and so forth until you're an hour early. Or set your clocks early. Whatever you need to do, but that chronically late attitude will NOT work in your benefit. You will miss flights, opportunities, and what have you in the future. Nor will believing in superstition. You are responsible for your own success. Our job as teachers is not to make your life miserable, but to prepare you to go out and kick the world's ass.\n\nWhen I ask questions like "Why don't you care about homework?", you may see it as snarky, but I don't. I want to understand you. I know you understand you, but I have 250 other students to keep track of. I cannot possibly fathom the type of stuff you're dealing with, so I need you to tell me.\n\nTry to keep it up for another year until you graduate. University opens your options to such an incredible degree, it's a wonderful chance for you to really explore who you are. If you ever want to talk, shoot me a PM.
I wanted the streetcar. I use it a lot when I'm downtown.
I don't disagree, nor do I mean to disparage you. But, I feel this has gotten too personal. If you disagree with the op, I'd encourage you to reply with sources backing up your claims.
Really sorry to the bearer of bad news, but it's quite an uphill battle for you. Most will not hire without a bachelor's degree because getting the work visa is a pain or impossible. Also, for accent reasons, they tend to want a native English speaker.\n\nThat is not to say it can't happen. Rural Thailand/China, and Cambodia will definitely have opportunities. But Japan might be really difficult.
That's what I did, and it worked out great. I flew to Thailand to do it, as the visa process was easier than Vietnam's.
I disagree. There are places where a TEFL is not a deal breaker, but it will make you much more employable for a small amount of effort.
I'd like to say my Z3C, but it's had a few hardware failures in the 2 or so years I've had it. (Broken digitizer and headphone jack)\n\nBut even when looking at new phones, none of them seem as fast or have the battery life of this one. If it breaks, I'm thinking of just replacing it with another.
I really doubt it. Most likely it's just a checkbox that has to be ticked, and the people initially processing applications don't care.\n\nHowever, it should be a moot point. Especially if you're going to be a teacher, best to lock down your Facebook now. Don't put it past students to print out unflattering pictures from 10 years ago, or dig up any other embarrassing info.
I live in Thailand, and the market here is so much different from the States. Samsung is around for sure, but any of the other "big" brands you'll need to find a specialty shop.\n\nHere, Huawei, Vivo, Oppo, and Wiko (is this a pattern?) are everywhere. Asus and ZTE have also made a nice push. The carriers also have their own phones which are rebranded from small Chinese companies, and some of them are pretty impressive. It's a tough game if you like custom ROMs, because there just isn't a dev community for the majority of the market.
I didn't. I only went to the doctor once when I was there, and it was very inexpensive.
As far as danger level, very little. Your biggest concern is being hit by a car. Overall, violent crime isn't a thing. In tourist areas pickpocketing can happen.\n\nHowever, I'd very much recommend against renting a car. Driving in Thailand is nothing like driving in the US, and without experience you're much more likely to have an accident. Put on top of that corrupt cops that see foreigners as walking ATMs, and there's a good chance you'll be pulled over for ""something". It's easy enough to get around a major city like Phuket with public transportation. And if you take guided tours, it's not needed anyway.\n\nStreet food.. maybe 40B a meal, on average. Hotels can go as low as 150b a night. Public transportation is less than 10b a trip. The guided tour will far and away be your largest expense.\n\nFor girls, just go to Patong beach. They will find you.
I went a few years ago. I suppose you go for the same reason you travel anywhere - it looks interesting to you. I had a great time, saw a kind of world that you're just not used to, and have a unique experience to share.\n\nPolitics aside, I hear Iran is beautiful and the people are incredibly kind. I've heard nothing but amazing stories from those who have visited, so I'm seeing how I can arrange a trip there soon.
I'll give it a go.\n\n1) I'm a teacher. I take different contracts around the world and stay there usually 3 months to a year or more.\n\n2) Met someone that did it, and he turned me on to it. I started out taking pretty low paying work, but now I'm pretty solid. I save money so that In between gigs I can travel more.\n\n3) Nomadic, I guess. Interesting way to think about it.\n\n4) Token white guy for a tidal bore ceremony in a small Chinese town. The mayor gave me some apples, and I got a ride home with the 'dove guy' for the event.\n\n5) I'll change my answer to this probably every month. Right now I'd say Bagan, Myanmar. Beautiful place where you can ride around all day visiting ruins by yourself. I felt like Indiana Jones.\n\nEdit: Formatting
One day, someone close to you will die.\n\nIt will suck a lot. But take it as an opportunity to put things in perspective. It makes the bumps of life feel trivial in comparison.
If you're doing this before travelling, I really recommend doing an online one for under $50. Paying more than that is kind of a waste for a piece of paper. Otherwise better to do it overseas. I did my CELTA 3 years ago in Thailand and it was $1200. Is it really $3000 in some places? 
It hasn't happened to me yet. But I have gotten other official mail that requested my presence. In general, you can just say that you are out of the country. They may require some sort of proof, but it's usually a pretty low bar to meet.
Just want to say thank you! I have not bought many apps, but Shuttle is one that definitely deserves the money.
They're all "legit", as there is no accreditation body for TEFLs. So go for it, it's a great starting point.
My experience is similar to AtomicMonkeys. I did it on a tourist visa, 30 days with a 30 day extension. Then went to Cambodia with an agency for another 30+30. You can definitely look for work, but scheduling interviews may be a problem. The CELTA is a full time experience and then some, I was working until I went to sleep. Maybe on the weekends you could squeeze one or two in if you're really dedicated.
Looks a little thin for my tastes. I'd put in some corn starch after to thicken it up.
我突然明白，他非常聪明
The statement was "Welfare, as it is usually administered, is evil". Which I do agree with. Not that welfare is evil, I believe it should definitely exist. But the administration of it leaves much to be desired.
Like others have said, HESS isn't bad to get your feet wet. Shane is a similar outfit. Nothing bad about them, but keep your ears open for a better opportunity once you get settled. Good luck! 
I remember seeing this graphic years ago. It legitimately changed my viewpoint on US immigration and illegal immigrants.
I think most of their program needs improvement. I understand that it's a video only medium, which is certainly different from my and im sure everyone else's training. But, it seems more like the kids are being taught at than taught to. I would like more interaction from the students aside from circling the correct answer or saying prompted sentences.
Leave the country.
Like others have said, most of the time it's for visa purposes. If you want to make a career out of it, no time better than the present to start down the path to get a degree. If you don't want to do it in your present country, there are online options. It may not be easy, but it's the reality of the situation.
Great town, we've just been here for a long time and are looking for a change.
Coming on a tourist visa is fine, IMO. I did it that way, as well as several of my friends. Having a Z prior would be ideal, but well, China.\n\nIf I were you I would push back, because they're lying to you. You definitely can get a work permit for one, or even zero years experience. Most likely someone along the way is sacrificing your integrity to avoid some red tape.\n\nIf it doesn't work out, walk down the street and grab another job.
They don't. There is no accreditation.
First, sorry you've been thrown into a very difficult position like this. The best thing would be to observe other classes at your school, and copy the good methods until you develop your own style. See if your DOS will let you.\n\nFor teens, try to let them be creative.  And explain to others what they made. I like to do things like writing a short letter saying why they should win something, and why their classmates should not. Then post them around the class and have them read how they threw each other under the bus. Lots of card and drinking games also can be adapted to ESL. 
So, not to be "that guy", but many of these are processes which obviously take longer than one day. I don't think anyone reasonably believes a "clean house" at the VA will happen within 24 hours. But he may well start the ball rolling, unbeknownst to any of us.\n\nWhile he and every other public official certainly deserve criticism, I hope that people will keep it rooted in reality instead of hyperbole and talking points.
Seems like this skirts the separation of church and state. Why not anyone who is persecuted for religious beliefs?
Thank you. We have a purple line like many other cities and I was a bit confused.
Heyo, look to see if there's a raccoon cafe in your city! I went to one recently and had a lot of fun.\n\nhttp://imgur.com/F1La3wG
I do. That's why a job should exist for you. One that lets you work according to your own schedule. And a system that supports you while you acquire the skills for that job, if you don't have them already.
Most markets are every day, so go nuts. I think the train market at Thai Cultural Center is pretty nice.
When I did this, I went from the town bus station. I don't think they have routes all the way to Vientiane. But there's a million songthaels as soon as you cross.
I second what /u/kalleron said. Phrom Phong, Asok, and Thong Lor are probably the most luxurious areas. Thong Lor especially has a big night life scene, but the others are only a metro stop or two away.\n\nYou might also consider Silom. It's as close as Bangkok has to a CBD, along with some upscale places to match.
Fair enough, but that doesn't mean it's a bad university. Might as well apply anyway, and if HESS doesn't like it, they can choose to reject it. I just see no reason to offer that information, because it is not relevant.
I'm legitimately curious about the hype for this game, because I rate it as vastly inferior to any of the SoMs. What do you feel it does better? 
Did you intentionally pick the number for Nintendo's customer service? I'm having childhood flashbacks.
I think it's really rude that we don't refer to countries by what the residents call them.
I know this is unlikely to get a legitimate response, but let's hypothetically remove Trump from the equation. This seems like a bipartisan, common sense sort of proposal that should have been a law already. Can anyone with an opposing viewpoint care to say otherwise?\n\n\n*Edit: Thanks for all the insightful, kind comments - especially from Trump supporters. Nice to know that there's still some common ground to be had.*
But as with any public forum such as Twitter, you can always point to individuals that disagree with you.\n\nI'd expect the overall support expressed to Vox in response to this question is quite high, given their audience.
To offer a slightly different opinion, when I did my stint in China I went on a tourist visa. While I was there, they had my Z-Visa sorted in a few days. I did not teach during that time, just observed. I did not have to leave the country.\n\nIt's good to be cautious, but I don't share the same opinion of some of the others here that it's a dealbreaker. But definitely something to watch out for.
This is why /r/neutralpolitics is one of my favorite subs on Reddit. Decisions have consequences, both positive and negative. It is such a refreshing change of pace to have people talking about the impacts, rather than just constant team bashing/praising.
Keep your reasonable, level-headed comment out of this! Rabble rabble!
I did the tour there, flew with them out of Beijing. It honestly was fine, pretty much like any other flight. I thought the food (pork curry) was pretty darn good.
I'm an American expat living in Thailand, and while I have not been to Saudi or Syria, I believe that you are incorrect. Thais are among the most tolerant people I have ever met. They do take criticism of the royal family seriously, but that is one area in an overwhelmingly free environment of speech.
Kinda have to agree with what others are saying here. I thought VV was terrible, a town full of trashy backpackers running away from nothing. There are some nice views, but overall it's a place to party.\n\nMight be fun for a day or two, but personally I couldn't wait to get out of there.
I would just not tell them, tbh. If it's accredited that's all they need to know.
180b in Bangkok, usually. For me checking the balance on my American card has never worked, but your mileage may vary.\n\n
This is really awesome info, I appreciate you taking the time to write it. \n
Depends on what you mean by decent. I got a pair of cheapo Chinese ones that are just two buds connected by a wire. About 4 hrs of life, and were around $12. I don't think I can go back to wired.
As some others have pointed out, this is not in Bangkok. This is Maeklong Market, in Samut Songkram province. About 2 hours away by Bangkok. (Or 3-4 if you're taking this train, and get lucky with the transfer at Mahachai)
And they may be correct in doing so. But that has not been the impression here.
Because the Royal Family is not really involved the daily lives of people. Like most constitutional monarchies, they have no real power. It would be like saying "You can talk about anything in the politics except that one small department over there". Everything else is free to criticism.\n\nI am not defending it as an idea, but to compare it to the scale of more oppressive and violent countries is misleading.
Haha, excellent suggestion, but that's where we are now! 
Not the OP, but I agree with them except for the social aspect.\n\nThis is a tricky problem where practically, we cannot all exist on welfare. People need to produce something that society requires and compensates for. However, you're typing on Reddit right now. You are capable of doing a lot, for example coding, translating, or writing. However, the market has completely left people with debilitating conditions behind, and I am in favor of a strong support system and/or wage restrictions to ensure they are being considered and above all not exploited.
It's usually my #1 consideration.
You need a degree in anything, mostly for VISA purposes. Of course, if its in English, so much the better. However, your comment is very telling of your entire issue. If you don't have a degree, how can you expect to compete with job hunters that do?
Not the OP but it probably wasn't a program. That's not unusual for a gig in China.\n\nEurope will be harder overall. Though, I would never pay for a job. I agree that you should get a CELTA if you're gonna shell out that much.
I'd say Chouti. Much closer to the experience than Tieba IMO.
I'd second /u/Cysolus and recommended Lufia 2. Absolutely fantastic game that does everything right.
Pretty late, but I'll jump in.\n\nI used to do in home electrical work, and showed up to this house in a dodgy part of town. The dude answered the door wearing a very nice suit and tie, except no pants except for his briefs. I expected he was on his way out, but he just sported that while I was there for about two hours.\n\nAlso, this guy had a fucking kickass living room. Massive TV when those were uncommon, unbelievable sound system, mini fridge, the works. Except the rest of his house was kind of a shit hole. One of the rooms even had a large hole in the floor.\n\nTruly, he was a man of extremes.
They were, but not any longer. Wearing black and white is appreciated.
I'm in the last semester of mine, but nobody else has answered you yet so I'd thought I'd chime in.\n\nIn regards to debt, I put a significant portion of my salary towards tuition. That's about it. Right now I'm just about breaking even.\n\nThe HR director at my school is a friend of mine, and they said it would be a pay bump after I finish. I'd imagine that's what it's like for a lot of Asia outside uni. They just want a warm body, and it's a "nice to have". I think it would be more useful for Europe and other places such as that.\n\nAs far as the courses... You know, it's like any college course. There are nuggets of info inside hours of bullshit. One class I loved and it completely changed how I teach. Others had limited usefulness, and still others fell in the middle. Hopefully someone wit more experience can talk about future prospects.
Well, it's a start anyway. Keep it up! :-)
Dec 2012 I think. I may have just gotten lucky that day!
Someone was talking about this recently. I think Chouti is pretty close.
Is it too late to get on the karma train? Last I saw them, they upped their game and started carrying firearms.\n\nhttp://imgur.com/a/SiGRc
In Thailand - have never seen a Drowzee before.
I agree with /u/Savolainen5. You could do it as a gap year sort of thing after you finish your degree, or turn it into a career. I was originally in IT, and I've been teaching for about 7 years now. I love it, and I'm not looking back. If I listened to my family I would still be stuck in nowhere town being miserable. \n\nI would very much recommend you do not do it without finishing your degree first, in whatever it is. I don't know what country you're from, but I would say the opinions of the teaching profession vary greatly from around the world. Some countries see it as a very prestigious position, others less so.\n\nYou don't have to commit to anything for now. After you graduate, try teaching for a year or so. If you don't like it, then you've gained a unique experience few have.
If you put this with some rice, it would go a long way.
In Thailand, they walk in the middle while looking at their phone.
Does your degree say "online" or something similar on it? \n\nIf not, I doubt it will be an issue. 
This is by no means a definitive answer, but when I worked for one of the large chain buxibans in China years ago, I was not given health insurance.
Criminal is a bit far. The only battles Crono would have gotten into that 1000 AD knows about is Gato, or the random Gaurdia forest creatures before the Chancellor moved to lock him up. I think it would be common knowledge that those creatures are dangerous.
I had two students who were always super late to class. Like, 30 minutes late in a 50 minute class. They always promised to be on time, and of course they got docked points, and went through a disciplinary process, but it never improved.\n\nSo one day they come in again, super late. I stop class and say "Ya know, I've just got to know... why are you late today?" in hopes embarrassing them would work. The kids (who are probably 16 or so), said proudly "Ah teacher... we were fucking!"\n\nBecause I am an adult child I joined the rest of the class in laughing, there was no way to be mad in that situation. Anyway, they got disciplined again after class but I omitted that detail. I find it much more effective if you explain to them why they can't do what they're doing, instead of feigning some emotion to frighten them.
Well, fair enough. As far as the dog, I'd expect him to do anything. Get angry, sad, show some sort of emotion.\n\nAnyway, agree to disagree.
Good on you! However, I'd strongly recommend you get a Bachelors before having a real go at it. In whatever field you study, often times work permits are not possible without a 4-year degree. You may find work, but it will often be illegal.
To be fair, recusal is not an admission of guilt, and it's important even if there is mere *perception* of bias (in order to maintain faith in the integrity of the system).

Yes. Milo says some things to people who want to listen to him.\n\nWhy must people insert themselves in between a transaction when they have no involvement?
Oh I see now. Yeah its a pain going in for work. For a pint, not so much.\n\nIf only there was an international trade agreement that allowed greater labor mobility of in demand jobs into Canada.\n\nOh wait there was...\n\nIt was called the TPP XD
So we cant take the presidents word for what the program will do?\n\nI don't think the DHS memo is an exhaustive description of the program...

Your words:\n\n>No he did not lie, he was asked if he spoke with Russians about Trumps campaign. Those insinuating he did and lied about it, are just accusations with no evidence of the sort.\n\nYour claims about your words\n\n>As I stated, nothing he did was illegal nor did he purger himself either. There was no criminal action with regards to anything he did or said.\n\nNote that nowhere in your original statement is anything about illegality or perjury or criminal actions.\n\n> you killed your own argument with the statement you just made.\n\nHow, please explain.\n
Elipses...
But the ban isn't necessary to look and reform one's vetting processes right?\n\nPresumably there is no longer the need for so much time anymore
He's very good you know...
yeah. I find the claims that wikileaks did not have an effect on the election ridiculous. It was a central focus of coverage and attack for a good portion of it. \n\nI was also iffy about wikileaks intentions during the election. The slow drip drip drip of releases, the purposeful timing and hyping - it seemed quite clear that this was pointed.\n\nThe question that seems to be central, though, is not whether wikileaks (with russian backing) influenced the election, but whether the Trump campaign was connected in any way?\n\nI doubt there will be any clear links. All a candidate has to do is make clear that they'd be a friend of Russia (Trump did) and Russia will just read the hints and take action no?\n\nRegardless, I am not happy about the independence of the election being affected.
Well I challenge you to provide examples where he has said something that falls outside of the bounds of free speech as per the current law.\n\nI don't agree with Milo but I find the reactions to him distasteful.
The organization has a mission statement that is not far from correct the record.\n\nThere has never been any direct evidence of either organization astroturfing.\n\nWhy is it you believe one organization is astroturfing, and not the other? The evidence against both is the same.
To be fair, recusal is not an admission of guilt, and it's important even if there is mere *perception* of bias (in order to maintain faith in the integrity of the system).
I may disagree with you there. The fairness doctrine is exactly what I mean by cure being worse than the disease; it put what was acceptable (what was 'honest', what was 'fair') in the hands of a few at the FCC. Is that not state control of content?\n\nThat to me seems more dangerous than some 'fake news'
If you read the caselaw, what milo says would never be restricted; it simply doesn't fall into the category of unprotected speech.\n\nSee the Phelps decision which affirms a long line of jurisprudence where KKK rallies, etc are all found to be free speech.
there we go\n\n(as long as you don't care about sig figs)\n
You underestimate me, good sir.\n\n
> It sounds like you have some pretty thin skin if an SNL skit riles you up to the degree it has. SNL will always go after whomever it is they please, it doesn't matter what gender, ethnicity that person is. I mean you do realize a staunch HRC supporter, Alec Baldwin, mocks and continues to mock DJT on their skits. Or maybe that time some artist decided to rectify a naked statue of DJT for everyone to gawk and criticize.\n\nI dunno why you are so worked up about this or why you think I am. You claimed that Clinton wasn't portrayed as cold/unfeeling by MSM; I give you a simple, well known example of when she was. Feeling triggered by evidence?\n\n> I certainly don't hear you complaining about any of that.\n\nis it all that relevant to whether there was sexism in Clinton's coverage? Am I supposed to rant about everything wrong about media when talking about a specific wrong? I think that might be your job...\n\n>https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/5835mc/google_spreadsheet_with_350_best_wikileaks/?\n> Have Fun.\n\nMan you are so intellectually lazy.\n\nEmail 1: Clinton campaign people talking about oppo research against Bernie. This is nothing.\nEmail 2: Podesta complaining that Brock (who is on the Clinton Team) is doing something that is bad for the campaign. this is nothing.\nEmail 3: Brazile was not working for the DNC at the time of the e-mail. It appears she forwarded a low level e-mail of suggested tweets sent to Bernie volunteers to get tweets out - not much of a "leak" (anyone can volunteer on this type of campaign and get this type of thing). This is nothing.\nEmail 4: content: "We won. Raising money today, talking the bedwetters off the ledge and heading to NH for a long weekend …let me know what else I can do"... this is nothing...\nEmail 4: Private person (Strom) (a Clinton supporter, not a Clinton Campaign person) writes an angry e-mail to Tulsi for not backing Clinton. Says he won't help her fundraise like he did in the past. This is nothing.\n\nThe list of nothing goes on - but I leave it to you to personally pick and say what you find bad, rather than the intellectually dishonest "here's a link of 250 e-mails, my point is proven.. duhhh"\n\n> So what you are saying is that the electoral college was perfectly fine all those other times it allowed a Democratic presidential victory but now since you lost based on the electoral college votes and won the popular vote you feel this is unjust and demand a swift immediate resolution.\n\nwhen have I said that? all I said was that it was a factor in the loss. The 3 point line was a factor in Golden State Warriors having the best record in the NBA - doesn't mean I'm advocating for its removal.\n\n> Interesting.\n> Actually yes Carly Fiorina was a prominent candidate in the Republican primary and Jill Stein was the lead candidate for the Green party. Honestly, I don't even know how to relate anything to you since you are SO convinced the MSM was sexist towards HRC. When in fact the MSM did everything in their power to help her get elected. If you really want we can go down that road but for now quit playing the sexist card. It's pathetic.\n\nAgain with basic logic - the existence/non-existence of sexism in coverage of others has no bearing on the existence/non-existence of sexism in coverage of Clinton...\n\n> Ok so you truly feel that the "last minute" decision to review the emails was an important factor in this election. Well how about this..if there was never a private e-mail server established in the first place she really wouldn't be in the situation she placed herself in would she? But this is ALL Comey's fault.\n\nI'm pretty sure I acknowledged the private e-mail was a factor. And you have a very reactionary and dishonest interpretation of words. I noted that Comey's letter was one of the influencing factors, and you're claiming that means that I am saying it's "all comey's fault"...\n\n> Nope. She wanted to go private to avoid every FOIA request possible. That's shady and just as karma works, what goes around came around and for her it came back with a vengeance.\n\nI'm not denying that it bit her in the ass, but that doesn't change whether or not media coverage was sexist...? \n\n> "It looked very bad." It looked fucking horrible. Basically what that told the American people is that Bill Clinton could do whatever the hell he wants. It doesn't matter if his wife is actually being investigated by the FBI for criminal wrongdoing, he can interview with the Attorney General and just like that no charges are recommended. Odd?\n\nAppearance of impropriety? absolutely. Actual impropriety? who knows - but mere appearance should be disqualifying in government (otherwise faith is lost in the system). The remedy was taken though, that the decision was left to the FBI. But again, this is not relevant to the main point of discussion.\n\n> No,there is nothing odd about that. Everything was planned and we saw something we weren't supposed to see.\n\nIf we weren't supposed to see it, I doubt that we would have.\n\n> This is all "sexism" though.\n\nYou really don't understand that things happen due to multiple factors... do you?\n\n>Basically everything I have gotten from this meaningless conversation is that HRC wanted to run for POTUS and be the 1st female president. \n\nthat is because of a lack of basic comprehension skills.\n\n>Fucking fantastic, however once other news outlet begin covering her e-mail server scandal, Benghazi etc.. she now needs to find a scapegoat to look face. What better card to defend than using sexism. She suckered all of her female support base on this very concept and used this cowardly tactic to gain traction in the election.\n\nI identify myself as independent. I am not particularly a feminist (and in fact have gotten into many fights with feminists over the concept of "patriarchy"). However, I call them as I see them. I saw sexism in the media coverage and perception of Clinton this election. This is not an excuse, nor does it explain all aspects of the election or her eventual loss. This is a simple observation on one of the influencing factors. You can certainly choose to ignore the invisible biases that you have and wallow in your puddle of ignorance, though. This is indeed America.
That comment is neither accurate nor cool.\n\nHe said hes working at a premie clinic a couple of times a week. I think that does give him far more knowledge than the average person, perhaps more than even doctors in other specialities.\n\nAre you a doctor?\n\nAll i can tell by your dumbass comment is that you're an edgy hater...
So the argument now is that he shouldn't release his tax returns because it would make him look bad?
Thats a bit disingenuous re: the planned parenthood bit isn't it? The defunding is not about std testing; its overtly stated that its about abortion.\n\nNot sure I agree with you concerning stop and frisk either. First, whether trump can actually implement it doesn't seem to be material; rather its whether it's a policy that someone wants/votes for. Secondly, despite the intentions (actual or merely stated) to not be racist, the implementation of the policy has been found to result in racism due to inherent and unconscious bias. Thirdly, the Trumpian stop and frisk was targeted specifically for inner cities by Trumps own words; guess what ethnicity is predominant there? It was honestly not so subtle coded language that was shockingly close to "we will stop and frisk black people". It wasn't even subtle.
> The attacks against planned parenthood are about abortion. However, the defunding affects the entire organization.\n\nBy your own admission, the goal to defund planned parenthood is about abortion. The fact that the defunding affects more than just the abortion side of things doesn't make the policy any less sexist... and arguing that services like STD testing will become collateral damage doesn't make the policy any less damaging.\n\n> Targeting inner cities with stop and frisk is a tough subject to even talk about. Inner cities are responsible for most crime. Black people commit a disproportionate amount of violent crime. Is it racist to target high crime areas? At a certain point I think crying racist is pointless. I don't think the idea is targeting people based on their skin color, but the unfortunate truth is black people end up targets because of their communities propensity for crime.\n\nIt is exactly your kind of thinking that lead to the severe prejudicial effects in the NYC implementation of Stop and Frisk that was declared unconstitutional. Fact of the matter is, our society has an internal bias against minorities, particularly black people. We unconsciously ascribe higher rates of crime *because* of skin color, even when community crime rates are controlled for.\n\nAnd you have to be working pretty hard to try to ignore the undertones of who Trump was trying to talk to and what purpose he had in advocating for stop and frisk. This was no reasoned policy argument - this was the Introduce a Fear, Promise Law and Order technique that has led to much suffering in the world.\n\nFrom the Report of the New York Attorney General: (https://ag.ny.gov/pdfs/OAG_REPORT_ON_SQF_PRACTICES_NOV_2013.pdf)\n"In 1999, the OAG issued an extensive report concerning the NYPD’s stop-and-frisk practice. The report demonstrated that, even when controlling for crime rates and the demographics of high-crime neighborhoods where police are more heavily deployed, blacks and Hispanics are stopped at a disproportionate rate. "\n
This cuts both ways though. The SC may go 8-0 in favor of the ban even if they disagree with it so long as the Pres has the power and the exec action is not unconstitutional.\n\nUnless Trump and everyone around him are insane (jury still out), he will have competent lawyers draft the EO to pass muster.
Hyperbole is a thing.
To be fair, recusal is not an admission of guilt, and it's important even if there is mere *perception* of bias (in order to maintain faith in the integrity of the system).
He did lie as per my analysis above. The evidence is simply his words. Don't let your political affiliation cloud your judgement.\n\nAlso, he admitted that he did talk about the election, albeit "superficially". But his defense is not that he did not talk about the campaign. It's that he didn't talk to the ambassador *in his role as a surrogate*.\n\nWhile I don't think surrogate is a magical on/off role - it's not that severable.\n\nThat being said, this reeks more of gaffe than intentional lie, because it would be a pretty stupid lie. Session's meetings with the Russian ambassador were hardly secret.\n\n
... that's a video of King thanking a bunch of leaders, one of them sessions, *for attending*....\n\nTIL; show up to the opening of a library and you are free from criticism forever...
You can't add percentages like that OP\n\n35% with additional 17% is not 52% off...
> How about we just legalize it and not tax it?\n\nthat sounds great, but keep in mind, offering taxation revenue is a key selling point to getting legalization pushed through.\n\nIdeal world, yes, weed should be like any other consumer good. However, in the political reality, a weed tax will be a driving force in getting legislation through.
But afaik its not against the rules for owners of media companies to donate to politicians?
I don't know about intent, but Session's words in their plain language meaning are false.\n\nIt is possible given the context that Sessions *meant* he did not have any contact with the Russians *in his role as a surrogate*. However, he does not state the italics, nor is this the obvious interpretation given the phrasing of the question and answer. The context gives a possible explanation and some ambiguity, but Sessions was not clear at best and lied at worst.
Fucking pussies afraid of the media. Back to your safe spaces, Trump-fucks.
Yeah, your post *totally* reeked of sarcasm... It is *completely* clear to *anyone* reading that you were being sarcastic.\n\nMy sources highlighted some of it already. The BBC anchor covered Clinton as shrill. Are you suggesting that Clinton wasn't portrayed as cold and unfeeling? \n\nAs for smoking gun, i read all the emails that people claimed was something; the content never matched the claims. Are you seriously using r/conspiracy as your source? Show me the smoking gun if you have one. \n\nFact of the matter is indeed she lost on her account. Part of that involved being a woman, among the myriad of other factors. I saw this play a prominent role in the election, in how people perceived her.\n\nI'm not playing a sexist cars; the election is indeed long over. I am instead reflecting on influencing forces in this election.
I just read that case. It was properly decided on the basis of law.\n\nThis is a question of qualified immunity, a near ironclad defense that rarely if ever succeeds in court. And in this case, based on the submissions, it's fairly clear that the burden on the plaintiffs was not met. The lower courts said so, and the majority agreed.\n\nAt the end of the day, judges can't decide on what their beliefs are, but rather what the law is. That makes stating the outcomes of decisions a completely useless metric to judge suitability.\n\nI'm fairly left wing, but am not outraged by this well-respected judge being selected, at least based on what I have seen so far.
But they do. Trump's not the first, he won't be the last.\n\nNewspapers often endorse candidates even.
 we're talking about VOICE here.\n\nIve explained my concerns about the ICE stats.
What stuff, compromise?\n\nModerate politics is simply the art of compromise that seems to be forgotten on this sub.
What? Americans don't need a visa to visit Canada... Just show your passport...\n\nWorking/immigration is a different story though
Orr we can try to be moderate and compromise and work together...\n\nYeah that's probably not happening
It's not a party thing; he's not really a politician. He's a legit jurist, well respected in the profession, which actually says a lot to me.\n\nAlso, I've just read a couple of his decisions since the announcement, and he seems very rational, well spoken, and fair.\n
overall crime? when you focus on a subset of perpetrators of crime with no justification, it misses the forest for the trees.\n\nImagine if I always talk about student X is acting out, and constantly propose programs to address him. You would think he's a problem child right?\n\nBut the reality is that Student X acts out *less than the other students*\n\nDid I lie saying when I constantly talked about Student X acting out? no. Is it wrong to try and address Student X's behavior? no.\n\nBut by not providing the bigger picture, and putting so much focus on Student X, you have the impression that he's a problem kid. That kind of bias sticks, it hurts, it distorts, and is certainly not helpful in an educational program. I've distorted by omission.\n\nThe same applies to whatever it is VOICE is seeking to achieve (which, really, what does it seek to achieve?)\n
Don't equivocate pre med and med students please.\n\nP.S., there is no diagnosing going on anywhere in the thread. We all know the diagnosis; premature birth.\n\nWhat everyone is talking about is the prognosis.
That's a goddamned "you don't want to be raped, don't dress slutty" argument...

Depends on what kind of conservative, tbh. There are factions which believe in mandating certain morals and norms for all Americans; typically called social conservatives.\n\nThe other form of conservatism believes in individual freedoms. This is a more libertarian perspective, and a more liberal perspective. This view would be that the government has no place in bedrooms.\n\nKeep in mind that 'liberal' and 'conservative' can mean so many different things that many issues, especially around sex/reproduction, has people under each label divided. And there are nuances in each issue that divide within each issue.
? even a legal interpretation would suggest he lied. He would likely avoid the crime of perjury for want of intent perhaps, but he did make a statement that was false under pretty much any interpretation.\n\nIn the plain text meaning - going by dictionary definitions, his words are false. But what about with context?\n\n*question:* \n"But if it’s true, it’s obviously extremely serious, and if there is any evidence that anyone affiliated with the Trump campaign communicated with the Russian government in the course of this campaign, what will you do?" - note that there are no qualifiers - no "to discuss the elections", no "in their role with the campaign" -\n\nparsed out: If [group] [did thing][during time], what will you do?\n\nSo:\n\n IF [anyone affiliated with the Trump campaign] [communicated with the russians][during the course of this campaign], what will you do?\n\n*answer:*\n"Senator Franken, I’m not aware of any of those activities. I have been called a surrogate at a time or two in that campaign and I did not have communications with the Russians, and I’m unable to comment on it."\n\nAka:\n\n1. I am not aware of any of those activities.\n2. [I have been called a surrogate before] AND [I had no communications with the Russians].\n3. I can't comment on what I'd do.\n\n2 is key here. Is [I had no communications with the Russians] modified by [I have been called a surrogate before], or the question, to suggest he is only talking about while acting as a surrogate?' I fail to see how.\n\nLet's take a look at an analogical Q/A:\n\nQ: If any farmers picked apples, what would you do?\nA: I am not aware of any of those activities. I have been called a farmer before, and I did not pick apples. No comment.\n\nHas the respondent picked apples? the answer would suggest no...\n\nI don't think "I have been called a surrogate before" does that, at least not clearly in any way. \n\n\nTL;DR: He did make a false statement under oath. Unlikely to be prosecutable without more (needs intent), but it is what it is.
I don't know about whats up with tyt, but banning media because you disagree with it cannot be the way to go.

How? The program focuses on *victims of immigration crime* (source: name of program). That means this program will focus entirely on the worst of the immigrant population (those who have committed crimes resulting in victims). \n\nThe groups you mention will not have anything to do with such a program... it purely highlights crimes where there is a victim and it is caused by an immigrant...\n\nThis is not a broad sample of immigrants/refugees to see their crime rate. This is a targeted program.
As an institution they allowed the event, but cancelled it because students rioted.\n\nPeople rioted because someone had something to say that they didn't like.\n\nThat is simply disgraceful and far different from an institution just saying " you can't hold an event here". Selectively prohibiting specific speakers for content is also a highway to an echo chamber.\n\nWhy do people want to interfere to what one person says to others, within the confines of free speech?
Seriously traumatic events affect people differently. Not everyone can process them in a way that lets them call in or respond.\n\nMany who are experiencing such circumstances find themselves not caring at all if they get fired or not - a common symptom for mild depression, let alone something even more serious.\n\nyes you will have repercussions/consequences sometimes (and Rose did face them), does that mean you lot should sanctimoniously shit on the guy? \n\n\nTake a chill pill, and quit judging the guy until you find out all the details. 
that's one of my biggest problems (besides when he lost me at stop and frisk - fourth amendment...). Trump is no conservative IMO - he just says whatever he thinks people would like, with little regard to the actual logistics.\n\nHe promises tons of new spending AND tons of tax cuts. I'm not an accountant, but does that not seem like just being doubly in the red?\n\nAnd his campaign "how he will pay for it" was just having "tremendous" growth. Betting on that is optimistic at best, and wildly irresponsible at worse. The economy is not purely dependent on American actions - any world event tipping the scales would mean double negative PLUS downturn. I'm not prepared to make a fiscal policy betting on growth...\n\n
Why wouldn't we want more? I think half truths are more dangerous than silence. This is a targeted, specific program that seeks to release specific information and stats while omitting the larger picture.\n\n
The problem with Tucker is that even at his best, he just tries to score cheap shots through interruptions, surprise questions that he prepared ahead of time to try and catch a guest unaware, and plain loudness as his 'rhetoric'.\n\nWhile these may help him win a particular argument, or make a specific guest look foolish, this does nothing towards furthering any type of dialogue, educating an electorate, or revealing anything.\n\nHe is entertainment for people who dislike his guests.\n\nRather than help, he hurts conservatism.
The President may still issue any EO he wants. However, if it doesn't take into consideration the court decision, it will be easily stayed in courts using the 9th circuit decision as precedent.\n\nSo technically he can do any EO, but he is still realistically subjected to the court decision.\n\nThat being said, if he cuts out the parts of the EO the courts took issue with, the travel ban would stick.
I may be against Trump, but I strongly disagree with this criticism.\n\nNot everyone who supports Trump is screaming for "made in America". There are many reasons people supported him. Pretending his supporters are hypocritical because a couple people bought knock-off Trump hats is intellectually dishonest. At best it's anecdotal evidence of dumb people (which anyone can find in any group of supporters). At worst it's sensationalist hackery.\n\nLet's not do the r/The_Donald please.
Not a trump supporter, but I'm confused here. Where is the conflict of interest?\n\nIf I own stock in a media org, can I no longer donate to a politician? I'm pretty sure that's not a rule.\n\nSimilarly, one may donate to a politician and still benefit from his/her decisions. Politicians are not barred from making decisions that may affect donors...\n\nPay to play? Whose paying to get what play? Are you talking about donors paying to get their views in politics, literally garunteed by the citizens united decision?
Couldn't they have just fixed the vetting process by now (their stated purpose for the ban) without all this mucking about?
I think you'll find few claming that a university has to offer them a space is illegal. I certainly haven't.\n\nThat does not mean certain actions by said university is not *against the principles* of free speech.\n\nCancelling an *already scheduled* event because some people on campus did not like the content is very much an action that hurts free speech.\n\nAnd certainly I too may disagree with Milo's rhetoric device, but singling out and naming is not uncommon, and doesn't to me cross the line. Milo, among many with his viewpoints are named and shamed just as frequently. Further I don't think selecting for content in that respect is in line with the spirit of free speech.\n\n
> The idea that Russia influenced the election is obvious bullshit with no supporting evidence.\n\nThis is the consensus of our own intelligence community.\n\n> Hillary Clinton and the DNC and other democrats were caught committing high crimes\n\n...what?
Isn't that what they were saying about the Quebec attack?  I'm not saying you're wrong, just pointing out what I think is a reasonable possibility. 
Imagine a house fire where all the investigators agree it was caused by arson.\n\nIn comes Tucker: if the fact that this fire was caused by man is a settled investigation, you must be able to answer how hot the fire was, right? If you can't tell me how hot the fire was, you can't prove arson.\n\nTuck: How do you know an electrical fire wouldn't have started on it's own if there wasn't an arsonist? \n\nTuck: If you know it was arson, you must know what the house would be like without the arson. Tell me the configuration of the bedroom. If you can't, you can't be sure it was arson.\n\nTuck: What percentage was caused by the arsonist and what percentage was the flammable materials? If you can't give me exact numbers, the investigation is not settled.\n\nYou will see, these are inane and asinine questions deliberately seeking to prove a point. Tucker is most certainly not open minded. He is a man on a mission.
I mean to be fair, Trump did use that tactic with his travel ban EO....\n\ndidn't work too well in either case.
It's how you present the information, and what information. As long as they stick to anecdotes, as politicians on both sides always do, it will not backfire.\n\nI do not support this one bit if their intent is to demonize immigration.
>But if someone wants to be victimized and purposely puts himself or herself in a position where it's likely to happen for that reason, it's hard to feel sorry for them.\n\nSo what you're saying is its hard to feel sorry for the rape victim that walked down a road alone at 1:00 am dressed slutty and drunk after clubbing...\n\n>My problem is that I'm 100 percent sure that Milo couldn't be happier that this happened. That doesn't put him on the right side of things.\n\nWho knows? I do know though that the above thread was trying to pin the actions of the rioters on Milo - a he was asking for it argument. I may not like him, but I'm equally distributed by the response to him.\n
First, I interpreted it as more of a mission statement. \n\nSecond, the name of the program is "voice"... \n\nThird, do you have any comments on the second part of my last comment?\n\n>Further, there is the simple problem of "look at how bad immigrants are - we had to make an organization just for their victims" - the optics are hardly fair...
Can we not use shareblue as a source and use actual articles? This sub is getting as bad as the_donald
That wouldn't be a fine. Fines are levied by the government. A fine for content by any regulatory body would almost certainly violate the first amendment.  A lawsuit for slander, on the other hand, would be a private tort action, and the award would be damages.\n
Wait what?\n\nI'm mightily confused why this article is a big deal. Arianna Huffington donates to Clinton/the dems (which i have no prob with either).\n\nHow does an owner of a media company donating to a candidate equal state media? Seriously, someone please explain this one?
Eh, the hobby lobby case is more a matter of the application of the religious freedom restoration act. It wasn't an outrageous decision on matters of law, though perhaps it was not as good on matters of policy.\n\nThat being said, the role of the court to shape policy is limited; that's the job of the legislature.\n\nCertainly all judges will have their principles seep into their decisions somewhat; there's no avoiding it. However Gorsuch does seem to be the type to limit that sort of interference which is really all we could ask for.\n\nHe does not have a history of favoring corporate over individual from whar ive read; its the laws that unfortunately do that to some extent.
one of the only remaining?\n\nABC, CBS, NBC, Fox, Reuters and Bloomberg were all let in?\n\nAnd it wasn't a press conference - it was a gaggle - something a little different.\n\ncertainly it was bad IMO that certain well respected agencies were not allowed in, but let's call it as we see it...\n\nmore importantly, your statement doesn't really say what the problem is that brietbart owners are trump donors...\n\n
> She wasn't portrayed in the MSM eyes as callous, cold or "unfeeling." You can thank Anderson Cooper and the boys over at CNN for that. Or the times John Podesta mingled with editors from major news publications about content to be published regarding queenie herself.\n\nClinton was portrayed as cold and robotic. Just look at SNL parodying that very portrayal...\n\nAs well, every major politician has ties/contacts in the media... reporters frequently clear stories with their subjects...\n\n>Right the content never matched the claims, because the Washington Post said so. If the MSM doesn't admit that something is factual it must not be factual then. And yes I am seriously using r/conspiracy as a listed new source since r/politics has taken a nose dive into the depths of leftist hell.\n\nI base my statement that the claims did not match my contents by reading the emails... You're more than welcome to link to any of those e-mails you think damning, and explain why.\n\n> YES PART OF THE REASON HILLARY LOST IS BECAUSE SHE WAS A WOMAN. Totally has some credence to it right? Doubtful, she shammed all her believers into truly believing she was victimized because she was a woman. Carly Fiorina and Jill Stein must have felt the same way I'm assuming, but how come they never spoke out against it? GET. REAL.\n\nYou mean if someone doesn't speak out against something it's not happening? Were Jill Stein or Carly Fiorina ever prominent candidates? Further, I fail to see how showing some women didn't experience sexism in coverage means another woman did not experience sexism in coverage of her...\n\n> Prominent role? Again doubtful, just another talking point for the Dems to make them feel as if their own party didn't sell out. I'm assuming the other myriad of factors you speak of are fake news, James Comey, Russia, Putin himself, Donald Trump, the rigged electoral college and voting fraud all compiled into this big disastrous botch one would call the campaign of HRC.\n\nA lot of those certainly played a role..? Except it's not that the electoral college is rigged, it's just unfavorable for Dems at this point in time. Is it so shocking to you that these things have an effect on elections?\n\n> This was all on Hillary, I certainly did not hear the left side complain at all back in July when the FBI and James Comey had recommended no prosecution be set forth for HRC due to her "extreme carelessness" on handling classified information in a private email server. But he sure is the boogey man now.\n\nso? I won't complain if someone doesn't do something wrong, I will complain if they do something right. Regardless, it's pretty clear Comey's last minute letter had a non-negligible effect on the elections (the extent of which historians/staticians can puzzle out).\n\n> But wait how could anyone forget that infamous "coincidental" tarmac meeting between Loretta Lynch and Bill Clinton. I'm sure that was ALL about grandkids. Weird, how just after a few days with that meeting (which no one was supposed to see by the way) the Justice Department would accept whatever recommendations the FBI makes. You know as well as I do she dodged a bullet. If she was so innocent, why would she consistently blow off the press and never hold a conference. If this was going to cloud the campaign (which it did) then why not be upfront and honest if you have nothing to hide.\n\nI feel like at this point you have strayed pretty far from whether or not there was sexist coverage. Ranting about other influences on the election won't change that. I do agree that regardless of what they talked about (I doubt grandkids), it looked very bad.\n\n> But she had everything to hide. One set of rules applies to society another applies to the Clintons. You don't think that's true than google Kristian Saucier. Kristian Took 6 photos of a classified nuclear reactor in a USN submarine and was convicted and sent to prison. Double standard? Of course. But that's none of my business.\n\nThat Clinton did stuff to fuck up her election doesn't mean there weren't other factors at play too... I have never claimed Clinton was not without valid concerns and criticisms, merely that sexism played a major role in the coverage/perception of her.
Your Claim: \n\n>She wasn't portrayed in the MSM eyes as callous, cold or "unfeeling."\n\nMy Example: SNL skit where she was portrayed as callous, cold, and unfeeling.\n\nIs SNL MSM? yes.\n\nDoes it portray Clinton as callous, cold, and unfeeling? yes\n\nDoes that make you wrong? yes\n\nDid I at any point claim that SNL was my reference to prove that sexism was an influencing factor? no.\n\nWas the reference to disprove a specific claim you made where you are completely wrong? yes\n\nDoes your argument that SNL makes fun of other people change the fact that my example disproves your claim? no\n\nDo you understand the difference between a reference to disprove a specific claim, and a reference to prove an overall argument? no\n\nAre you therefore wallowing in ignorance? yes\n\nIs this ignorance a puddle? no. it's more a swamp at this point. It's time to drain that swamp.\n
are you being serious? Here's a massive list of newspapers endorsing Clinton...\n\nbusinessinsider.com/hillary-clinton-endorsements-newspaper-editorial-board-president-2016-2016-9\n\nFrom Article: "This presidential election may have the most lopsided batch of newspaper endorsements the US has ever seen.\n\nWhile Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton has garnered the support of a long list of editorial boards, her Republican rival Donald Trump has only received 19."\n
>I can certainly expect the media and lefty think tanks to.\n\nWhich those who are on the other side will deride as biased, fake, and ignore? I don't think the government providing a half truth and relying on media and lefty think tanks are the way to go...\n\n>Finally, Trump said that ICE would be targeting the criminal aliens no? So, unless he is lying, ICE stats would grossly overrepresent criminals no?\n\n>We'll find out! That's why the stats will be useful.\n\nBut if it is overrepresented as I fear, those stats will be misused and abused...\n
Guus to the Rescue!
response to your edit:\n\nbetter be careful about your sources - you might want to you know... read them.\n\nAs per your snopes link:\n\n>However, the above-displayed award has some unusual aspects to it. For instance, we found no record of anyone else’s having received an “NAACP Governmental Award of Excellence,” nor were we able to locate any reports (from 2009 or otherwise) regarding the NAACP’s honoring Sessions with such an award.\n\nFurther comments by the NAACP again, as per your snopes link:\n\n>“The NAACP is composed of more than 2,000 local and state units around the country.  Upon learning of the allegation that one of those units bestowed an award on Senator Jefferson Sessions in 2009, the National Office of the NAACP immediately undertook an investigation.  While we already have strong reasons to doubt that any such award was given to Senator Sessions, we will continue our investigation until we are confident that we know all of the facts.  What remains true and unchanged is the NAACP’s strong opposition to the nomination of Senator Sessions to become the next Attorney General of the United States.  The NAACP’s position against Senator Sessions is based on his decades of conduct as a prosecutor and, later, U.S. Senator from the State of Alabama.  In matters of civil and human rights, civil liberties, fair policing, voting rights, sentencing fairness, women’s rights, hate crimes and more, Senator Sessions has repeatedly demonstrated that he is clearly unsuited to perform the duties of an Attorney General in these crucial times.”\n
Trump on VOICE: "We are providing a voice to those who have been ignored by our media, and silenced by special interests."\n\nThat seems to be far more than merely providing information...\n\nIt seems based on Trump's characterization that VOICE will be releasing information. Not stats, but information- anecdotes likely.
I think you cannot ignore *how* hitler sold genocide - and how normal humans like you and I bought what he was selling.\n\nThe first stage was dehumanization and demonization; characterizing the minority group as evil and criminal. Is that not what we see? "Rapists and murderers"? I could see VOICE causing a similar effect- highlighting crime caused by immigrants to create a disproportionate representation of immigrants as criminals.\n\nI do not see why this is helpful from a victim perspective. Knowing the immigration status of the perpetrator surely can't make what happened to them better or worse, could it?
then link those! I don't know why shareblue is the one everyone is favoring. Maybe the_donald is right, and there is some rigging from the organization...\n\nI would not be happy if this sub becomes just a mouthpiece/echo chamber for any particular political organization. It gets toxic, boring, and plain stupid (example: the_donald)\n\nbut that's what's happening all over. The front page of this sub is constantly sensationalist headlines followed by various meaningless "omg so corrupt/hypocritical/evil"
>Nothing he said is inconsistent with the DHS memo\n\nBut it does expand it no? "Giving a voice" is far from giving information...\n\nFurther, there is the simple problem of "look at how bad immigrants are - we had to make an organization just for their victims" - the optics are hardly fair...
rioting is not free speech...\n\nand I also draw the line where one "free speech" suppresses another.\n\nCriticism is fine. Criticism is where an idea is challenged on it's merits. This does not appear to be criticism. It appears to be suppression, where the goal is to prevent an idea from being heard. That's what the protest was for.\n\nI am no Milo supporter, but I honestly find the reaction to Milo as distasteful as the man himself. He is a monster created by us.
perhaps not in his inner circle, but the government has many constitutional lawyers whose sole purpose is to defend government actions/laws from constitutional challenge.\n\nIt's one of the main roles of the attorney general...
Hyperbole is a thing.
maybe those are just his eyes at this point...
Well wasn't the point of pointing out specific crimes of a specific group (im Hitler's case, jews) an effort to demonize them? And its effective no?\n\nEven if immigrants and refugees commit crimes at a lower rate than citizens, constantly highlighting their crimes will demonize them, no?\n\nAnd why make a victim group for victims of crime caused by a certain group only? From a victims perspective, an assault is an assault regardless of the immigration status of the perp no?\n\nWhat makes a victim of a crime caused by an immigrant any more worthy of attention vs. a victim of a crime by a citizen?
I'm no fan of fox, but that violates the Constitution so much, it's not even funny... (1st amendment)
he based this on a textual interpretation of the law - something that, while I disagree with, is a respectable enough interpretation of legislation.\n\nSince the announcement, I've read some of his decisions, and am not as distressed as I thought I'd be with a trump SCOTUS pick - in his actual decisions, he follows the letter of the law, not what his personal principles are.
That was part of Hitler's claim... Along with the jews taking jobs that could have been done by honest hardworking Germans... And that imorrality was simply their backwards savage culture... Sound familiar?
> looking at the fact that a Presidential candidate had the father of a spree killer on stage with her because she thought it would help her electorally\n\nThis did not happen...  This was a false story.\n\n> looking at the fact that the leadership of a pro-apartheid organization with terrorist elements, BLM, were being treated as serious thinkers and legitimate activists\n\nA pro-apartheid organization with terrorist elements? ...what? Look, there is nothing wrong with questioning the efficacy of the BLM movement, but these are tin-foil hat accusations you're leveling here.\n\n> What part of 'the President sided against the police' do you not understand?\n\nAll of it, I guess.  What are you talking about?
I would suggest to you that any side of the political spectrum would agree with those principles.\n\nWhat the fundamental disagreement is throughout our politics is the scope and solutions of the problems we face today. For example, some Republicans believe that small government and less regulation encourages the economy, benefiting humans - and view corporations as simply a vehicle for humans.\n\nSome republicans don't believe in climate change and hence feel that reducing carbon emissions don't help protect the environment.\n\nSome republicans believe that social assistance leads to dependence, and long term lack of self fulfillment through said occurrence.\n\nThe Climate thing aside, there is some evidence for all of the other propositions. There is some evidence against it too. Regardless though, we have a tendency on this sub to view those positions as "anti-human" or "anti-needy people", which does a disservice to political discourse.
But the rhetoric hasn't been to vilify rapists and murderers...\n\nIt's been to vilify illegal immigrants and refugees *as* murderers and rapists...
Because if he's not saying something illegal, hes just a guy saying things to willing listeners within the bounds of free speech.\n\nKeep in mind this was something that Berkeley was going to allow; they pulled it cause stupid people rioted.\n\nBerkeley doesn't have to allow an event, but they shouldn't cancel it just because some students dont like what a speaker has to say.\n\nHigher education is supposed to be a marketplace of ideas too...
I don't think you can expect people to "assemble" the full picture. \n\nNor is the picture VOICE is painting (as you rightly mention in another reply) about stats. It seems to be more about anecdote.\n\nFinally, Trump said that ICE would be targeting the criminal aliens no? So, unless he is lying, ICE stats would grossly overrepresent criminals no?\n
Aaand this sub has gone to the dogs. It's becoming the_donald of the left...\n\nSensationalist click bait titles\n\nMeaningless echo chamber comments (gop/trump bad, amirite)\n\nDoesn't even hide it- links to shareblue, a democratic activist website, instead of actual news organizations. 
I'm genuinely sorry you feel that way.
Then, with all due respect, it sounds like people are going to die, in part, because of your ego as well.\n\nThe difference between Bernie fans and Bernie supporters is that his supporters kept listening to what he was actually saying after the primary.  When he endorsed Clinton, he didn't turn his back on you; you turned your back on him.
Is there a codified test that can distinguish between gay and straight?  Have we identified the gene for depression.  Do we have a concrete understanding of why we sleep?  Hey, while we're at it, aren't the theories of gravity and evolution just theories?\n\nYou're putting up overtly unscientific barriers in order to avoid having to consider an idea that you simply don't want to believe.  The idea that we have to understand something in its entirely before we can acknowledge its scientific validity is a common rhetorical tool for standing in opposition to scientific progress.\n\nIf you actually want to find out more about the science of gender, there is plenty of ongoing research you can learn more about.
Evidence for what?  I'm just saying that a man attacking armed soldier with a machete sounds like suicide by cop.
I'm here as a Sanders supporter who is invested in the success of this movement.  But this sort of petty nonsense is exactly why people don't take us seriously.  \n\nPretending not to understand why Sanders can be out on the front lines right now and Clinton cannot — that just strengthens the stereotype that Sanders supporters are politically naive.
A troll isn't just "anyone who doesn't agree with me".  
I don't think Trump has enough true political conviction to put him anywhere on the spectrum.  My personal politics don't align at all with Mike Pence, but he seems like he actually believes in what he stands for.
There's nothing about being critical of the President-elect that is at odds with Republicanism.  This isn't a Donald Trump fan page.
But I thought America was going to be respected again...
Hey, if you have irrefutable scientific evidence for anything, go publish a paper on it and get your Nobel Price for changing the fundamental nature of the entire field of science!  Until then, the science is, by definition, refutable.  That's what makes it science.\n\nBut I'm guessing what you're really asking for is scientific evidence for the idea that gender and sex can be biologically independent.  Wikipedia actually has a pretty good summary of some of the recent studies on the biological causes of transsexuality: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Causes_of_transsexuality\n\nAnd if you want to find out more, there's a great book I'd recommend, called "The Chemistry Between Us", which talks about gender and sexuality (among other things) from a empirical scientific perspective through the lens of endocrinology and neuroscience.  It's not too long, and it's an absolutely fascinating read!
To be clear, the correlation is with education, not necessarily intelligence.
Fair point.
Yeah, I was recently banned from /r/The_Donald for this comment: https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/5gzeia/the_new_algorithm_was_designed_to_keep_president/dawcf7n/?context=10
Same.  I'd strongly recommend r/Republican.  I tend to find more thoughtful discussion of conservative principles there than r/conservative.
> it's very obvious because you all use exactly the same phrases.\n\nWait, are you saying I'm a paid Clinton shill?  If so, I've done a pretty bad job.  Probably why they haven't paid me yet...\n\n> Guccifer 2.0 is not Russia.  Wikileaks source was inside the DNC. Not Russia.\n\nThis is contrary to the explicit determinations of the US intelligence community.  Either they're lying, or you are mistaken.  \n\nAlso, if the source was from inside the DNC, they wouldn't have needed to hack anything.  Unless your saying that someone in the DNC leaked these emails and then made it look like they were hacked by Russian groups to cover it up, and did so convincingly enough to fool the NSA... if so, I think you're highly overestimating their technical competence over there.\n\n> as if the democrats wouldn't put out propaganda like this.\n\nI have no illusions that the democrats are any less willing to lie than the republicans.  But independent bipartisan agencies don't typically coordinate in massive misinformations campaigns. (And yes, that includes the scientific consensus behind climate change.)\n\n> The idea that 17 independent agencies all reached the same conclusion is bullshit.its not a conspiracy, it's just a straight up lie.\n\nAre you calling James Clapper a liar?  Clapper was a Lieutenant General in the air force, fought in Vietnam, and has served in Intelligence roles under Republican and Democratic administrations.  It's not like he's some partisan hack...
I don't think she's saying it's untrue.  I think she's saying it's a true statement that is widely used as smokescreen to evade more meaningful discussion about discrimination.\n\nI'm not saying I agree with that, but I think that's what she's trying to express.
Seriously, this tactic is embarrassingly obvious...
What do you think a "strawman" is?
I've been guilty of this myself.  This comment really made me think.\n\nThank you.
Our democracy is looking startlingly fragile lately...
Yeah, this sounds more like suicide by cop...
A low level cabinet position is still a pretty high level, all things considered.  This looks like pretty transparent quid pro quo.
Still curious: was there anything prior to the 2016 election?
If you don't mind me asking, did you end up voting for Clinton in the primary?
Who could have possibly seen this coming...
No one is trying to take away your terrorism card.  All I'm saying it is that elements of this attack seems to fit the profile of suicide by cop.
From the ODNI website: "The Intelligence Community did not make an assessment of the impact that Russian activities had on the outcome of the 2016 election."\n\nIt's doesn't say it had no effect, it just isn't the job of the Intelligence Community to measure that effect.  It's clear that this event had some impact, because Trump used mischaracterization of the leaked material as a major campaign strategy in the final weeks before the election.  \n\nDid it actually change the results?  That's much harder to say, but given how narrow Trump's victory was and how many undecided voters broke for Trump in the final weeks, it seems like a very real possibility.
> It may be fascinating, but it isn't based on hard science.\n\nThis particular book is all about human biology, particularly through the lens of endocrinology and neuroscience.\n\n> Meaning, a test could be run that would identify trangenderism in a patient before he/she self identifies as such.\n\nExactly, this book is talking physical indicators of transgenderism.\n\n> Gender isn't a mental state, it is a biological one. If medical science is unable to biologically identify between two purported genders, than there is currently no distinction.\n\nThat is a lot of what this book addresses – the idea that gender and sexuality aren't just a social or mental constructs, but rather physiological realities.
"OK, first of all, these readings as you know are confidential, classified. So, I’m not allowed to talk about what went on in a meeting.\n\nAnd — but we had many witnesses in that meeting, many of them with us. And I will say, again, I think it’s a disgrace that information would be let out.\n\nI saw the information; I read the information outside of that meeting. It’s all fake news. It’s phony stuff. It didn’t happen. And it was gotten by opponents of ours, as you know, because you reported it and so did many of the other people. It was a group of opponents that got together — sick people — and they put that crap together.\n\nSo, I will tell you that not within the meeting, but outside of the meeting, somebody released it. It should have never been — number one, shouldn’t have even entered paper. But it should have never have been released. But I read what was released and I think it’s a disgrace. I think it’s an absolute disgrace."
> I will never stop disparaging HRC until the typical Democratic voter stops defending her and her terrible record of lying and cheating.\n\nThat's certainly your prerogative, but you should drop the fantasy that this is what Sanders secretly wants from his supporters.  He's been exceptionally clear about his support for Clinton, and he's also been exceptionally clear about his very real criticisms of the DNC.  He doesn't need you to speak for him.  He needs you to actually listen to what he's been saying.
Agreed!
If his weapon of choice was a machete, sounds like that probably wasn't his goal.  That or he's just a really shitty terrorist.
Republicans had a problem with the kind of executive orders Obama signed, not the amount.  Obama used his orders to legislate aka step on the toes of Congress.
> Russian citizens are independent people and not a hivelike collective\n\nYes, when I say "Russia", I'm referring to the Russian government.  This is an exceptionally common idiom in political conversation.  \n\n> The idea that they 'hacked the DNC' and then gave information to WikiLeaks to release for the purpose of getting Donald Trump elected president seems more like a wild conspiracy theory of loose correlations than something built on actual facts and logic\n\nAnd yet, this is the explicit consensus of the bipartisan US intelligence community.  \n\n> governments generally don't just expose the intelligence they gather on eachother.\n\nUnless that government is specifically trying to use that information to influence a foreign election...\n\n> It seems our current government has some vested interest in animosity against Russia and wants that to be the narrative they present the public with.\n\nI don't know if you noticed, but the entire western world has animosity toward Russia right now because they have been doin' some real shady stuff for a few years.\n\n> Furthemore, if this were a directed attack at the DNC and Hillary Clinton specifically, it does not explain why the same attempts were made on the RNC.\n\nI can't imagine why a foreign government would want dirt on the people they are trying to put in power... /s\n\n> Until they present some kind of actual evidence that it was someone within the Russian government responsible for the 'hack' (amateur phishing attempt), I'm not buying into it.\n\n[Here's the report](https://www.dni.gov/index.php/newsroom/press-releases/224-press-releases-2017/1466-odni-statement-on-declassified-intelligence-community-assessment-of-russian-activities-and-intentions-in-recent-u-s-elections) from the Office of the Direct of National Intelligence.\n\n> When is the last time you remember the CIA or NSA being loose-lipped on any matter of national security?\n\nAnd yet you ask why they aren't presenting the public with more concrete evidence?  You answered your own question here.\n\n\nYou're obviously an intelligent and politically involved person, but you're selectively believing what you want to believe.  It's not the just the Democrats who are concerned about what happened here.  This is a really big deal.\n\n*Edit* By the way, I genuinely appreciate the high-effort response.  I enjoy political conversations with people who are willing to take the time to thoroughly back up their views, even if I disagree with them.
No, I don't believe you do.
Carlson's questions were not only completely fair and relevant, they are *genuinely important topics of discussion*.  If you aren't prepared to even acknowledge these issues, you have absolutely no business taking an interview on transgender rights — and I say that as an unequivocal supporter of transgender rights and an advocate for the acknowledgment that transgenderism is a biological reality.
Haha, fair point, but I mean prior to the formal election cycle, i.e. before 2016.  What has Guciffer 2.0 been involved with outside of the 2016 election?
Yes I agree.  I believe (hope) I'm simply describing a very vocal minority.
Hey, I'm a Democrat, and I assure you: hypocrisy exists on both sides of the aisle.
This is a transparently false dichotomy.\n\nI'm a registered Democrat (so I can vote in the primary) who was openly critical of the DNC during the primary for how they treated Senator Sanders.  I was also a Clinton supporter in the general because I'm a moderate, and Clinton's policy proposals aligned with my views for the most part.  That doesn't mean I think the DNC should get a pass.\n\nThe fact that Russia successfully influenced our election (whether or not you believe the final result was changed) in favor of a man who is so clearly unfit for the office — that should be deeply disturbing, regardless of your political affiliation.  This is a really big deal, and there are plenty of people on both sides of the aisle who are willing to recognize that.\n\nThe only people who insist that you can only be disturbed by one issue or the other are the people who are trying to sweep one of those issues underneath the rug.  This is a very purposefully manufactured false dichotomy, and both sides are guilty of it.
> Race war and anarchy has been narrowly averted.\n\nDo you genuinely believe this?
He was talking about being outraged at he level of child poverty in this country.  Have you ever heard Sanders make these sort of petty jabs at Clinton?  No, because that's not what he's about.\n\nIt's a shame that so many Sanders "fans" out there never really seemed to get the core of his message. It was never just about blind revolution and self-righteous indignation. It's about doing the right thing and putting your country before yourself, even when it's not flashy, even when you have to swallow your pride.
This isn't propaganda, this is a report from the office of James Clapper, the Director of National Intelligence, which outlines the consensus of our 17 independent bipartisan intelligence agencies.  Clapper was a Lieutenant General in the air force, fought in Vietnam, and has served in Intelligence roles under Republican and Democratic administrations. It's not like he's some partisan hack...\n\nJust because you don't like what it says, that doesn't make it propaganda.
Was this a refugee?
> Are they under educated because they are voting for Trump, or are they voting for Trump because they are under educated?\n\nFair point.\n\n> Hope for something better is at least better than giving up and accepting 4 more years of oppression, insults and bigotry from the left.\n\nI think this has an awful lot to do with the election results.
Also, what high crimes do you think the DNC was caught committing?  I'm no fan of the DNC, but I have no idea what you're referring to here.
Both /r/The_Donald and /r/SandersForPresident appear to be filtered out of /r/popular.
What guys?
According to Trump's account, this was not included in their verbal brief, but it *was* included in their written brief.\n\nI don't know what actually went down in that meeting, but I stand by my original statement regarding the report that Trump wasn't briefed on that material — Trump said otherwise in his press conference.
And then muted when I asked why I was banned.
Still curious if there is evidence that Guciffer 2.0 was active prior to the election.  That could potentially be a game-changer.
Exactly.  Regardless of your feelings about the efficacy or morality of the President's refugee and immigration ban, everyone across the political spectrum should be encouraged by the 9th circuit court ruling.\n\nThe DOJ was arguing that the President has "access to classified information about the threat posed by terrorist organizations" that the court does not have, and so they should not be able to override his judgement. Just think about how dangerous that argument is for a second, regardless of your feelings about this particular president, and the precedent that would have set if it had been accepted by the court.  Every time the executive branch wanted to circumvent judicial review, they could simply call it a matter of national security, citing, essentially, "I know something you don't know."  That would fly in the face of separation of powers.  \n\nIt's also complete bullshit.

That is our greatest danger, becoming used to it and thinking that it is normal. It is not normal. It is an outrage.

Well put.  Thank you for this.
[Here's the report](https://www.dni.gov/index.php/newsroom/press-releases/224-press-releases-2017/1466-odni-statement-on-declassified-intelligence-community-assessment-of-russian-activities-and-intentions-in-recent-u-s-elections) from the Office of the Direct of National Intelligence.
Yeah, as a moderate, I used to joke about how Mike Pence would be worse because he actually believes in the far-right talking points he runs on, as opposed to Donald Trump; but in all seriousness, I'd much rather have a responsible adult with whom I disagree running the country than an unhinged demagogue.
Did you read the declassified report?  Obviously they are limited in what they can reveal, but there is an awful lot of information there.\n\nEither the U.S. intelligence community is being honest about their findings, or 17 independent non-partisan agencies are engaged in a coordinated massive conspiracy all to benefit the outgoing President and the political party that is no longer in power...\n\nOccam's razor, ya know...\n\nBut either way, this is a *really* big deal!
> Read history. Islam has been at war with Humanity since it started in a cave in the desert.\n\nSo this is, simply put, an *exceptionally* misinformed understanding of world history.  \n\nThis is a really nice, concise and digestible series of videos on world history that I would strongly recommend: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLBDA2E52FB1EF80C9\n\nIt's obviously not comprehensive, but it will give you a nice broad context for understanding specific civilizations and time periods in more depth.
It's all over the news.
I genuinely don't understand this sentiment.  I'm not trying to be antagonist; I voted for Sanders in the primary.  I've just never understood the level of animosity toward Clinton from Sanders supporters, particularly when that animosity has been so clearly rejected by Sanders himself.
I personally felt the article gave a pretty fair and interesting perspective in the beginning – what I found off-putting was this assertion:\n\n> You're either a boy or a girl, period. Efforts to deny biology aside, the vast majority of the world still recognizes male and female when they see it. Cross-dressing is weird, and you can expect people to react accordingly.\n\nThe idea that "you're either a boy or a girl, period" is simply not biologically accurate, and people take issue when Conservatism is continually associated with outdated science.
Donald Trump said otherwise in his press conference.
I abhor straw-man arguments as much as you, but this is not a misrepresentation at all.  Donald Trump has repeatedly purported a connection between vaccines and autisms which has been thoroughly debunked.\n\nAnd I would argue that when the President of the United States shows such a blatant disinterest in empirical scientific research, that is a huge priority.  That has very troubling implications for how he will choose to address issues like economic policy and national security for instance.
Donald Trump has made multiple demonstrably false claims about the connection between vaccines and autism, and he's been criticized for it by people of all political leanings.  Why isn't this a reasonable question to ask of his supporters?
We are official in the era of troll politics...
In addition to referring to the document as an "intelligence briefing" during his press conference, he implied pretty strongly that this information was provided to him as part of his briefing, and he did, in fact, read the summary after the briefing.  His exact quote:\n\n> "OK, first of all, these readings as you know are confidential, classified. So, I’m not allowed to talk about what went on in a meeting.\nAnd — but we had many witnesses in that meeting, many of them with us. And I will say, again, I think it’s a disgrace that information would be let out.\n> I saw the information; I read the information outside of that meeting. It’s all fake news. It’s phony stuff. It didn’t happen."\n\nThat's the fact.
The mods also sent me this: http://i.imgur.com/wF1DgJq.png\n\nBizarre little cult they've got goin' on over there...
Agreed.  Regardless of your feelings about the efficacy or morality of the President's refugee and immigration ban, everyone across the political spectrum should be encouraged by the 9th circuit court ruling.\n\nTo clarify, this ruling was NOT a final determination on the legality of the executive order, but rather a refusal to stay the lower court ruling.  More importantly though, this became a ruling on whether or not the judicial branch has the authority to review executive decisions on national security.  Why? Because the DOJ was arguing that the President has "access to classified information about the threat posed by terrorist organizations" that the court does not have, and so they should not be able to override his judgement.\n\nThink about how dangerous that argument is for a second, regardless of your feelings about this particular president.  Think about the implications of that view, and the precedent that would have set if it had been accepted by the court.  Every time the executive branch wanted to circumvent judicial review, they could simply call it a matter of national security, citing, essentially, "I know something you don't know."  That would fly in the face of separation of powers.  It's also complete bullshit (pardon my French, but let's not mince words here.)  Matters of national security are always subject to judicial review, and courts regularly receive classified information under seal and maintain its confidentiality.  This case was a transparent and sloppy power grab by the Trump administration, and it failed justly.\n\nEven if you are 100% in support of the ban, I hope you can see that the 9th circuit court ruling was a very good thing.  It's an important sign that at least part of our system of checks and balances is still working properly.
I just got banned and muted from /r/Feminism with no reason given about a half hour ago as well.  I'm wondering if maybe it was a mistake.
That's a pretty bold statement to make from someone who I'm guessing lives under the protection of the most powerful army the earth has ever seen.  Don't get me wrong, I'm no war-monger by any means; this just seems overly simplistic.
> Hahaha! It is propaganda. It's not like it's science.\n\nWhat exactly do you think our intelligence agencies do?  They're not consulting a ouija board about this.  These are some of the best scientists and experts in the country who do these types of investigation.\n\n> Assange confirmed it wasn't Russia.\n\nI'm sure you already know that Assange has a special relationship with Russia.  It's not the first time he's erroneously jumped to their defense.  Remember the Panama Papers?\n\n> guccifer 2.0's activities preceded the election\n\nGiven that Google doesn't have any hits for "guccifer 2.0" prior to 2016, that seems highly unlikely.  What source do you have for this?\n\n> the propaganda doesn't even say what you think it does\n\nAgain, this is a report from the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, and it says exactly what James Clapper has said himself: The intelligence community has a high degree of confidence that the Russian government worked to swing the election for Donald Trump.\n\n> we are going in circles because you won't respond to the facts\n\nI've responded to everything you've said, and I've done so with facts.\n\n> Shill\n\nDon't be a caricature, dude...
I love Bernie Sanders and voted for him in the primary, but good gravy, his supporters can be the worst sometimes...  \n\nRealistically, how does this sort of unnecessarily divisive rhetoric help anyone at all?  This is why people roll their eyes at us.
To be fair, the Republicans didn't necessarily sell out.  They already had a pretty strong incentive to sabotage education:\n\nhttp://fivethirtyeight.com/features/education-not-income-predicted-who-would-vote-for-trump/
This is what I assumed as well for a long time. I ended up looking into the science of transgenderism more after a friend of mine transitioned, and discovered the science behind it is way more complex and interesting than I assumed.\n\nThere's a great book I'd recommend, if you're interested in learning more, called "The Chemistry Between Us", which talks about gender and sexuality (among other things) from a empirical scientific perspective, and one of things it covers is the specific mechanics that are believed to be at play for people whose internal gender differs from their external genitalia.\n\nIt's really fascinating!
More people need to read the actual decision before condemning it. Regardless of your feelings about the efficacy of the President's refugee and immigration ban, everyone across the political spectrum should be encouraged by the 9th circuit court ruling.\n\nTo clarify, this ruling was NOT a final determination on the legality of the executive order, but rather a refusal to stay the lower court ruling.

I'm glad you appreciate it!  I think these kinds of discussions are so important in the current political climate.\n\nI have found non-partisan fact checking websites to be an absolutely essential tool for reading news in the last few years.  It's amazing how many conspiracy theories, intentional misrepresentations, and just plain old fictions are passed off as news now!
Good god....\n\nYou know, sometimes, it's hard to tell if I'm in a Sanders sub or a Trump sub.  As a Sanders supporter, I find that pretty sad.  I suspect Bernie would too.
No, I'm a supporter, and this definitely doesn't represent me.\n\nThat said, this does represent a very prominent and discouraging segment of Bernie supporters who are more interested in blind revolution and self-righteous indignation than actually listening to what the man is trying to say.
One of those what?  Is this really a controversial view in this sub?
> However, Trump is not the POTUS yet, so I am unable to criticize his performance in office yet. I would also argue that Trump is not at the "helm" of the GOP. He received very little support from the GOP in the last year.\n\nFair point.\n\n> I think it's fair to say that Obama is a childish, naive, thin-skinned narcissist based on the way he has acted as POTUS.\n\nYou lost me there.  I can't help but think that accusing Obama of being a "childish, naive, thin-skinned narcissist" sounds especially ridiculous and far-fetched given his successor. I'm not saying there aren't valid criticisms of Obama's presidency – but I don't think this is one of them. 
They literally didn't....
Apparently they're being changed with that, among other things.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/AP/status/817079875240689664
I was so ready to be rick rolled here.
Maybe "dream Trump" is your dream candidate, but real Trump in real life, as judged by his real actions and statements, it not a social libertarian and fiscal conservative dream by any stretch of the imagination...
There are definitely substantive criticisms you can make of Obama's policies – but this is just shallow political rhetoric.  For conservatives to continue with this narrative of Obama's arrogance and elitism sounds absurdly disingenuous with Donald Trump at the helm of the Republican party...
> He was there at her event.\n\nThis is worlds away from your initial claim.  He was in the audience of an event which was open to the public.  He definitely was not invited on stage with her as you suggested.\n\n> How many cops and white people will they have to kill or torture before you take this aspect of their activities seriously?\n\nIf the BLM organizers start ever encourage the harming of police officers or while people, I will take that very seriously!  That's never happened though.\n\n> I'm talking about the times he sided against the police.\n\nWell here's an actual quote from the President:\n\n"The overwhelming majority of police officers do an incredibly hard and dangerous job fairly and professionally.  When anyone, no matter how good their intentions may be, paints all police as biased or bigoted, we undermine those officers we depend on for our safety."\n\nSeems reasonable to me.  When do you feel that he has been anti-police?
why?

Jon Huntsman would be an extremely qualified SoS.  I hope that's the way things go.
I agree.  Saying that "gender is only a social construct" is just as unscientific as saying that "you're either a boy or a girl, period."
I think most conservatives would feel pretty strongly that r/The_Donald doesn't represent conservatism at all.  This kind of insular reductionist rhetoric doesn't help anyone.
Seriously, this urge on the left to censor those we disagree with hurts us so much more than our opposition.
I personally felt the article gave a pretty fair and interesting perspective in the beginning – what I found off-putting was this assertion:\n\n> You're either a boy or a girl, period.

Probably a lot.  Not really what I'm speaking to though.  Attacking armed officers with a melee weapon is a classic suicide-by-cop technique.  That's all I'm saying.  This does not sound like the work of a man who wanted to "kill as many people as possible."
I think the election of Donald Trump is a national embarrassment, but I completely agree... \n\nThis is just bigotry and hypocrisy, plain and simple.
I didn't come into the subreddit to complain about the users.  I've been with this sub since the primary, in which I voted for Sanders.  I also have some serious concerns about a portion of the Sanders "fan club" that is bringing the movement as a whole down.  \n\nIf you don't feel like being self-critical, that's up to you.  But that doesn't make any of this trolling.
> Over two millennia ago, a new hope was born into the world, a Savior who would offer the promise of salvation to all mankind. Just as the three wise men did on that night, this Christmas heralds a time to celebrate the good news of a new King. \n\nSeriously, this wasn't much of a stretch...\n\n
That's a valid view, but you have to understand that most people don't share it.  I don't think that it's an unfair compromise reduce the the cap back to 50K, considering how unpopular the refugee program is among Americans.
There are only five factors and most of them don't apply:\n\n * race\n * religion\n * nationality\n * political opinion\n * membership in a particular social group\n\n> US is unlike European countries in that sense if that's what you are saying.\n\nI'm not sure what you mean here.  This is straight from the US immigration website.
FTA:\n\n > And while Beggs' family has said he wanted to compete against boys, UIL deputy director Jamey Harrison, who refused to address Beggs directly, said they had not received a request to change divisions from any athlete at this competition.\n\nSo someone is probably lying.
I don't know if I would call it fake news but it was pretty dishonestly reported when it first came out.  The Times still hasn't even corrected/supplemented the claim yet.
I agree with you that this statement should have come out from the beginning but i don't think for a minute that this would have stopped the media from making assumptions and telling half-truths.\n\nIt was pretty clear from the beginning that this wasn't a Muslim ban but that didn't stop the press from reporting it as such.  It was also clear that the countries targeted originated from Obama-era policy, but that didn't stop outlets like NPR from implying that any country that did business with the president was spared.
This isn't the briefing, it was an invite only press gaggle in Sean Spicer's office.  CNN still gets to go to the briefings.\n\n
There's several parts to it.\n\nThe refugee ban is 120 days during which the asylum process is reviewed.\n\nThe travel ban is 90 days from the 7 flagged countries.
This is a position he has held for years.  In fact, this was a fairly bipartisan and noncontroversial issue until Trump touched it.
It's a shame.  It looks like he lost support for being too pro-immigration.
He called out the Supreme Court in his SOTU Speech...
[http://fortune.com/2016/12/06/donald-trump-apple-google-celgene-alphabet-goldman-sachs/](http://fortune.com/2016/12/06/donald-trump-apple-google-celgene-alphabet-goldman-sachs/)\n\nThat's one source but they're all over the place.  He could have lied about it but he didn't really have a lot of money in stocks anyway so it's not exactly a huge effort to get rid of them.
Ideally yes, the state could do it since they would be on a level playing field as any business.\n\nI think that this never hold realistically though.  There would always be something that tips the balance of power to the state, such as an unbalanced power dynamic when negotiating.
Except, as stated in the link you provided, that the attorney bringing the case forwards argues that Section 3 of the order (the Visa Suspension)  is unconstitutional as well, not just the Refugee section.  Section 3 makes no mention about religion at all.
> Can you make an argument for refusing to let somebody back in the country who was already fucking vetted? I don't think so.\n\nYou can argue that you don't have confidence in the vetting process that was in place under the previous administrations.
> It's looking like the latter, especially considering Flynn only resigned when the Washington Post revealed that the White House knew the risks for weeks and put Flynn on the NSC anyway. They were perfectly happy to ignore the problem until WaPo revealed a higher level of awareness.\n\nI don't think that's true.  They were talking about firing him well before the WaPo story.  Also he wasn't fired for talking to the Russians, they knew that already.  He was fired for lying about what they discussed in the call.
That article lists more than a single occasion.  You can chalk the State Department's snub to an oversight but not the multiple briefings.\n\nAnd today's event wasn't a banning either, nor was it an official briefing.  There is precedent for this sort of thing that extends before Trump or Obama.
Thanks for keeping an open mind.\n\nBut I have to ask.\n\nGiven the facts that:\n\n* He ran on a much stronger version of this ban\n* Most people are distrustful of the current refugee vetting process\n* The refugee program is extremely unpopular in the US\n\nis this not a fair compromise?  He isn't completely scrapping the program, just issuing a temporary suspension to improve the process after which it is returned to pre-Obama era levels.\n\nIf this kind of action elicits such hysteria, what hope to we have of finding common ground on other issues?\n\n
That's talking about the refugee process, not the ban.  The 120 day ban is nationality based (the 7 countries that the DHS flagged as "countries of concern" over the past two years).\n\nAfter the ban, preference is then given to refugees of "persecuted religious minorities" of which Christians are one.  There are other groups included as well.  The EO mentions nothing specifically about Christians though.
Well, as of now, none of the leaks have shown any of those.\n\nI won't rule out the possibility of future ones doing so though.
How long 'till he makes his lower court appointments?  There's four seats in the 9th circuit that need to be filled.
He met several times with Trump to discuss the SC nomination so i assume he had some input.\n\nAccording to Nap\n\n>"I'm ecstatic over this," Napolitano, a former New Jersey State Superior Court Judge, said, "[Gorsuch] is the most worthy jurist in the country to fill the shoes of Antonin Scalia."\n\n[source](http://insider.foxnews.com/2017/01/31/judge-andrew-napolitano-neil-gorsuch-brings-scalia-dose-skepticism-government-supreme)
\n\n> A) firing senior staffers at various agencies because of critical comments during the campaign. A fair number of them supporters of other republican candidates...\n\nYou have to give more concrete examples.  he's fired lots of people, which happens whenever these is a new administration.  That is well within their power and done by other administrations.\n\n> B) Asking the FBI to rebut critical news stories.\n\nThe FBI approached them, not the other way around.  They asked the FBI to go public with their story, but they refused.\n\n> D) Appointing Bannon to the NSC and the various rumors that have been leaked about the whys and whats of that.\n\nThat wasn't a leak.  That was an EO.  And rumors mean nothing.\n\n> E) Nice leak today about the executive orders resuming construction on the Dakota access and Keystone pipelines. Guess who happens to be an investor in both projects? Both companies are currently suing and being sued by the government. Executive action under those circumstances is, I believe the kids are calling it "shady as fuck".\n\nLink?  Not seeing any news today about it.  Also, Trump sold all stocks in public corporations prior to taking office.\n\n> F) the biggest of big deals is the leaked rumor Trump was offered a stake in a russian oil company in exchange for sanctions being lifted. If that is true, even if the offer was made and not disclosed to the state and justice departments, this is going to be a nice, short presidency.\n\nLink to the specific leak?\n\nYou're out of your mind right now.  You are basing everything off of unsubstantiated speculation regarded the leaks and rumors.  As of right now, the leaks have been embarrassing, but haven't shown any real violation of ethics or laws.  When they do, I'll be the first to criticize.
No it isn't, stop being hyperbolic.  She works for the president and refused to do her job so she had to be fired.\n\nIf she thought it was unlawful, the correct thing to do is inform the president and then resign.  Instead she chose to be incredibly unprofessional and told the Justice Department to not enforce the law.
In her statement, she made her decision because she didn't agree with the law, not because she thought it was unconstitutional.\n\nThe order was passed and the DoJ signed off on it.  She either does her job or she resigns and lets someone else do it.
Right now, the Republicans in Congress need him too much to let him fail.  Many of them have been waiting a decade to pass parts of their agenda.

Everyone didn't just get to barge into those.
He knows what's in it right?  Why can't he just leak it to the press?
That does concern me as well, but I am going to wait until there is policy laid out before judging.  I am hoping that, like his cabinet selection, his actions are better than his words during the campaign.
That refers to the asylum process, which is suppose to take religion into account.\n\nThe EO doesn't specify Christians, instead it refers to persecuted religious minorities, which are a group Christians belong to.  Other persecuted religious minorities are also prioritized under this policy.
[There was more than one occasion actually.](https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/erik-wemple/post/fox-newss-benghazi-coverage-van-susteren-says-obama-administration-excludes-fox/2012/11/06/d5f7b336-280f-11e2-96b6-8e6a7524553f_blog.html?utm_term=.af5662b6c701)
Assuming that number is true (and I doubt it's that high), there would be no way to tell who someone voted for so how would you change the totals?
He can shit-talk the media all he wants.  Unless he decides to take some government action against the press, it's not infringing on their freedoms.
You commented on why Saudi Arabia wasn't on the list and I responded.  These countries were not picked out of a hat, they were picked based on policy that has existed for years.\n\nIf you want to know why Saudi Arabia is on the list you aren't going to find it in news from this week, you'll need to look farther back.
> Dude, they absolutely show things that are awful but because youre desprate for a bilobography youre not paying attention\n\nDid you mean bibliography?\n\nHow the hell am I suppose to know what he is talking about?  He made references to rumors/leaks that didn't even exist.  He said there was a leak about the DAPL today but there is literally not a single story that about the DAPL that came out today.  In order to respond to him I need to know if he is either remembering things incorrectly, making stuff up, or if there really is a story that I missed.\n\n> Astounsing how you can discredit all these anonymous sources, totally skip over C, " Obviously theyre is validity if theyre downing a major advisor like that.\n\nI didn't comment at all about the validity of the sources.  I said the leaks didn't reveal unlawful behavior, which is the case with the Flynn leak.  The leak was embarrassing for the administration and put them in a position where Flynn had to be fired.\n\n> then be so brazen to say "havent shown any violation.\n\nIt's a matter of fact.  They literally haven't shown any violations.  When or if they do, then we can roast him; but as of right now, you are hallucinating.  What's even worse is that you are placing the Snowden leak revelations at the same level as the Trump administration leaks when the two aren't even on the same planet.
Does the state owned ISP get to avoid all the permits and easements necessary from the state to build its infrastructure?\n\nI've worked for an ISP startup.  The state was probably the biggest barrier to the work that we did.
My intention was pretty clear but if you missed it go back and read my comment again.\n\nThe Democrats filibustered many lower court nominees throughout the Bush administration, but their obstruction grew greater when they took control of the Senate in the 110th Congress, leaving a large amount of unfilled seats when Obama took office.  Then, in 2013, Reid invoked the nuclear option, allowing Obama to pack the courts with liberals and transform the federal judiciary in his image.  You are dead wrong if you think that actions like that were going to go unreciprocated.\n\nThe Republicans escalated, by blocking Obama's nominees to the lower courts as well as the Supreme Court, something the Democrats swore for decades they would do if given the chance.  Now Donald Trump comes in with even greater power, all because of a precedent which Harry Reid set.\n\nThe Democrats can threaten to block Gorsuch, but they are powerless to stop it.  Filibustering may make the hardcore liberals and the donors happy but it will make them appear hypocritical and childish to the moderates whom they desperately need.\n\n> Bet you're still complaining about Borq. The only problem is that Borq was not favored by the majority of right, either.\n\nIt's Bork.  And no I was't talking about Bork, but you know full well that you are telling half the story.  The smearing of Robert Bork by the Democrats was absolutely disgusting and started us the politicized scorched-earth path that we are on today with regard to the Federal Judiciary.
> Officials told the publication that they have seen no evidence of collusion in regards to hacking or the election.\n\nShouldn't that be a little more prominently presented in this article?
Honestly I find it refreshing that he is calling them out for what they are.\n\nThat being said, it would be nice if there was some middle ground, an adversarial press that is somewhere between the one that fawned over the previous administration's every action and the one that is openly at war with the current administration to the point where they fabricate stories out of thin air.
Nationality based, just like this one.
FTA:\n\n>And while Beggs' family has said he wanted to compete against boys, UIL deputy director Jamey Harrison, who refused to address Beggs directly, said they had not received a request to change divisions from any athlete at this competition.
> DoJ OiC signed off that it was valid legal language and nothing more. \n\nThis is flat out false.  The OLC considers both lawfulness and language.\n\n> They did not sign off on the constitutionality of it\n\nThe constitution is law.  Signing off for legality implies signing off on constitutionality.\n\n> nor on its merits,\n\nThat's not the job of the OLC.  And it isn't for her to decide which laws to defend based on "merit".\n\nYou people completely unreasonable.  Even the harshest critics of Trump and his travel ban are excoriating Yates for the action she took last night.  This was nothing more than a cheap political stunt in hopes of scoring points with the DNC and it's perfectly representative of the politicization that's come to exist within the federal bureaucracy.\n\nHow do you think people would react if an AG decided to stop enforcing civil rights laws? or environmental regulations?  An AG does not get to to take an a la carte approach to the law.
Conservatives were angered by the scope of Obama's executive orders, not the amount.  He used them to pass de-facto legislation, stepping on the toes of Congress.\n\nYou can argue that Trump is doing the same, but I don't see it.
> If it doesn't make a difference, why does Trump feel the need to revoke it? It would seem hes trying to make a political statement\n\nNow he doesn't have to defend it against all the lawsuits.
Leniency for "persecuted religious minorities" has always been part of the asylum process.
This was the Senate though.  Does the house have a similar rule?
She's a foot shorter and never played pro-basketball.
> "A well-balanced breakfast, being necessary to the nutrition of a healthy person, the right of people to cook and eat eggs shall not be infringed."\n\nObviously the people have the right to eat eggs but only for breakfast and only with the proper breakfast permit.  No permits shall be issued for eggs cooked or eaten during lunch or dinner.  The pan used to cook aforementioned eggs cannot have a black handle or ergonomic grip.  In addition, high capacity pans which measure more than 10" across are strictly forbidden since no one needs a pan that size anyway.
Two points:\n\n1. Complaints about Obama's use of executive action weren't directed at his early executive orders.\n\n2. Impactful doesn't imply encroaching on the Legislative Branch's powers.
> the argument being made is that the EO included exemptions for granting access into the US based on religion\n\nTo clarify, that is not an exemption to the ban.  That relates to what goes on after the ban.\n\nI also don't think it applies here.  The process of granting asylum is suppose to take religion into account and it is specifically mentioned in US asylum laws.\n\nIn addition, this part of the EO has neither been implemented nor planned yet, so there is no way to tell if what they are going to do is unconstitutional or not, hence the "to the extent permitted by law" that you find in many EOs.
That comes after the ban.  And it isn't specific to Christians, it is persecuted religious minorities of which Christians are part of.\n\n
Yeah but NBC is pretty decent.\nCNN is garbage.\n\n
> The Secretary of State and Homeland Security can grant access to individuals on a case by case basis, at their discretion, and the EO specifically included text about religious minority as a reason to grant access. Sure sounds like an exemption to me.\n\nI'll concede this point.\n\nBut I still think calling this unconstitutional tortures the notion of freedom of religion, otherwise the asylum laws themselves should be considered unconstitutional.
I don't see how that changes anything.\n\nIt's temporary with clear end points and even after the 120 day period, it caps refugees at pre-Obama levels (50K per year rather than 70K).\n\nWhat is more troubling IMO is the issue of green card holders.  Barring them from entry makes no sense, since they are legally required to reside in the United States, which is why I am hoping that they repair that issue.
Obama took flak because his executive orders stepped on the toes of Congress, not for the amount of executive orders he passed.
> but neglected to mention why Christians refugees would be given priority \n\nChristians aren't singled out.  The EO references persecuted religious minorities.  Christians belong to this group.  The asylum process is suppose to take this into account, no idea why they weren't doing this before.\n\n> why the original plan involved detaining green card holders.\n\nCan't really answer you here.  Someone screwed up along the pipeline either in writing it or implementing it.  Either way, including green card holders in the ban makes no sense, since they are literally required to live in the US by law.
We'll know for sure in the next financial disclosure which I believe is in May.
You pretty much nailed it.  Like most of the leaks so far, this is embarrassing not illegal.\n\n
They included ABC and NBC.  Do they support the administration too?
That's an issue you have to take up with the Obama Administration, not Trump.\n\nThe list of countries was compiled by DHS in 2015/2016 as part of an Obama era policy limiting immigration/travel from "countries of concern".  This is simply an extension of that policy.\n\nIf you look at the text of the order, the countries are not named at all.
He took an existing policy and turned the dial from 5 to 6.  He didn't add any new countries or take any away.  This action doesn't represent the enormous shift in policy that people are making it out to be.\n\n> without giving it any real thought. I guess we shouldn't be surprised.\n\nThis is probably true but for a different reason.
> She has very little experience compared to other candidates.\n\nCompared to other candidates in the cabinet or compared to other SecEd candidates?\n\nMost former secretaries of education were in the same situation, no teaching experience but lots of policy experience.  Some had 0 experience in either (see: Clinton's SecEd).
I can't believe people wanted to vote for this guy.
I'm aware of Bier's OpEd.  The article I linked is a thorough response to it.
> If the wiretap did happen and something was discovered and the President gave it to someone with adequate clearance and legally gave it to other agencies (after making it easier to spread info, once again legally) then nothing was technically illegal but it is bullshit behavior.\n\nAfter the piece that came out in the NY Times a few days ago, I'm, inclined to believe that that is what happened.  If there was something was truly fishy, we would have heard of it by now.  Instead we're getting a series of embarrassing leaks.  The intelligence agencies are suppose to take enormous care in preventing anything learned from surveillance of American citizens from being disseminated.  Instead Obama encouraged the spread of this information resulting in inevitably making its way to the press.
Nothing, so let's not pretend one is better than the other.
[That wasn't the only time though.](https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/erik-wemple/post/fox-newss-benghazi-coverage-van-susteren-says-obama-administration-excludes-fox/2012/11/06/d5f7b336-280f-11e2-96b6-8e6a7524553f_blog.html?utm_term=.af5662b6c701)\n\n
I bet probably just forgot to change the name in the template.
>  And how will we vet the refugees after 120 days? How is banning them now going to do anything except stop people in need for the next four months?\n\nThat's part of the executive action.  The program is suspended for 120 days, during which the vetting process is reviewed and improved.\n\nYou don't have to agree with it, but it does have a clear endpoint and goal.
So this pretty much confirms what he said at the press conference last month?\n\nI'm kind of surprised he wasn't lying.
This is from a libertarian perspective.  Reigning in the EPA is not something that a libertarian would be opposed to, neither is opposing FCC overreach.  The only one out of the bunch that is objectionable is Sessions.\n\n> DeVos is laughably underqualified\n\nStop repeating this meme.  She has spent over a decade influencing the highest levels of Education policy.  There have been other SecEds with far less experience.  Bill Clinton's SecEd had literally never been involved in any kind of education at all.
Yeah, that also adds to the absurdity.  To be fair though, Obama continued many of the practices, so they did make him look bad too.
> It's still an exemption, correct? Regardless of when it takes place, at the end of it, it's still an exemption.\n\nNo, it's not an exemption.  There are no exemptions from the ban.  There is only prioritization of certain refugee classes after the ban.\n\n> You're right, religious persecution is part of asylum laws, and so it is redundant to even have this minority religion exemption because the means to immigrate because of religious reasons already exists.\n\nIt's not currently working that way however.  The current process is discriminatory against religious minorities, whom are in the worst situation among those seeking asylum.  This line was meant to correct both those issues.\n\nedit: I forgot to mention one thing.  EOs are suppose to be redundant, they cannot add new laws or remove existing ones.\n\n> IMHO the exemption was a gift to the left for grounds to attack the constitutionality of the EO.\n\nI haven't seen any compelling challenges to the constitutionality of this order yet.  Are you aware of any that you can link?\n\nI don't think the constitutionality is the issue here, especially not with the part you are specifying.
They aren't Americans or on American soil.\n\nThe EO doesn't specify Christians, but persecuted religious minorities of which Christians belong to.  The asylum process is suppose to take this into account.
Those are two different issues.\n\nGoing by what is known right now, the DoJ's warning wasn't about the calls he made, it was that he might be susceptible to blackmail because he has ties to Russia going back years.\n\nHe was fired because he lied about the content of the call and the amount of calls.  You can choose to speculate on how much the rest of the administration knew but none of that is confirmed.

She's spent years influencing the highest levels of education policy.  You may not like that experience but it is experience nonetheless.\n\nWe have SecEds with far less experience than she has.  Hell, Bill Clinton's pick literally had no experience whatsoever.

10% of Syrians are Christians.
The RNC wasn't hacked.  They attempted to but failed.
I highly doubt the Democrats are considering the cost.
A. They aren't citizens.\n\nB. The asylum process is suppose to take religion into account.
Can you cite that?  The only thing I heard is about that was from an unnamed source.
I want a watchdog press as much as the next person, but there's simply no way to trust the media with their coverage of this administration.  They've either cried wolf, misled, or outright lied so many time that it is almost impossible to tell what is valid criticism and what isn't.\n\n> Also, the fact that scientists are being discredited on environmental topics is a disgrace.\n\nCan you explain what you are referring to exactly here?
This was probably his most libertarian pick in my opinion.
On what metrics are you making the comparisons?\n\n[The similarities between Gorsuch and Scalia are insane.](http://www.scotusblog.com/2017/01/potential-nominee-profile-neil-gorsuch/)
If that was her opinion, then she should have resigned.\n\nEnforcing that order was her job, you don't get to not do your job and expect to keep it.
I'm indifferent towards the ban but I don't think it is unconstitutional.
It's ironic because the Snowden leaks revealed horrible abuses while the current leaks under Trump have done no such thing.
Don't pretend that this is a war the Republicans started.  The Democrats did it to Bush's appointments as soon as they took control of the Senate.  They threatened to do it with the Supreme Court as well but they never got a chance to.  Ironically, much of this obstruction was supported by Barack Obama at the time.  The Republicans just returned the favor.
> Judge Wynn said that since persons who lawfully carry firearms are “categorically dangerous,” they “sacrifice certain constitutional protections afforded to individuals who elect not to carry firearms.” In other words, the price of exercising the constitutional right to bear arms will be the forfeiture of other constitutional freedoms — which include, according to Judge Wynn, certain free speech and search-and-seizure protections.\n\nDamn, Obama sure knew how to pick his judges...
The right to life means no one can kill you without infringing on your rights, it doesn't mean  someone has to actively ensure that you stay alive.
I didn't vote for him, but I'm satisfied with what we got.\n\nHe's picked far better cabinet appointments that I expected (for the most part) and has chosen a better judge for the Supreme Court than any of Obama's nominees.
FTA:\n\n>  And while Beggs' family has said he wanted to compete against boys, UIL deputy director Jamey Harrison, who refused to address Beggs directly, said they had not received a request to change divisions from any athlete at this competition.\n\nThat being said, I really don't think it's fair to be putting boy in the position where he would have to wrestle a girl.  In many co-ed wrestling divisions, boys who are scheduled to compete against girls will get booed and will often forfeit rather than go through with the match.
> " The argument is the conflict of interest and that he isnt making decisions in his best peoples at heart.\n\nOh yeah, those leaked phone calls with world leaders sure showed a conflict of interest.  The National Guard being used to round up illegal aliens, that one sure did too.\n\nThis isn't even moving the goal posts, this is changing the whole damn game.  The argument is that the leaks showed "horrible abuses of government".  They didn't show that, period.  Trying to pretend that Snowden's leaks were the same or somehow more "evil" is both insane and offensive.
I doubt he's expending any political capital here.  The rule was unpopular to begin with and now he doesn't have to waste resources defending it against a dozen or so lawsuits.
It's understandable for you to not be aware of it.  What isn't OK is what what is suppose to be a respectable news outlet takes advantage of that.
Right thing is stepping down.  Recusal is the absolute least he could do.
DNC leaks started 5 days after Sessions' meeting with the Russian ambassador at the RNC.\n\nedit: Incorrectly stated "2nd meeting" originally.
Just remember.  It's not a lie if you believe it.\n\nBoth?

Shouldn't you be investigating pizzagate?\n\nGo away.

Just another snowflake from T_D.
Now you're being close-minded.  I never said it wasn't OK to be a sycophant.  If that's what you are, embrace it.  You do you, sycophant.
Not yet.  This is the next round of lies.  Only after they get exposed do we get resignation.
Let's just start with the ones who colluded with Russia to influence the 2016 Presidential Election.
>professional protesters\n\nFake news.
What?  They already did.
They'd tell you, but they can't recall.
Trump supported the Iraq war.
This is nuts.  It's like Carmen Sandiego's henchmen.   I guess Wilbur Ross leads somewhere.\n
So who do you trust for news?
Out of the Russian propaganda playbook:\n\n>Surkov is one of President Putin's advisers, and has helped him maintain his power for 15 years, but he has done it in a very new way. \n\n>He came originally from the avant-garde art world, and those who have studied his career, say that what Surkov has done, is to import ideas from conceptual art into the very heart of politics. \n\n>His aim is to undermine peoples' perceptions of the world, so they never know what is really happening. \n\n>Surkov turned Russian politics into a bewildering, constantly changing piece of theater. He sponsored all kinds of groups, from neo-Nazi skinheads to liberal human rights groups. He even backed parties that were opposed to President Putin. \n\n>But the key thing was, that Surkov then let it be known that this was what he was doing, which meant that no one was sure what was real or fake. As one journalist put it: "It is a strategy of power that keeps any opposition constantly confused." \n\n[Source](http://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2016/10/12/bbcs_adam_curtis_how_propaganda_turned_russian_politics_into_a_circus.html)\n\nThe referenced Adam Curtis video is also worth a watch.

First two might work.  Apathy is a bad bet right now, people are pissed.  Don't see that changing by 2018 if this administration continues on its course.
Is there anything to leak though?  Flynn was fucked because they spoke on the phone and it was wiretapped, so the intel community knew exactly what they spoke about.  Sessions conducted these two meetings in person, so I don't know how we can expect any more details to come out of them.\n\nThat said, maybe there was phone communication with Sessions as well that gets leaked in the coming days.\n\nNot that it should fucking matter; what Sessions just said in his press conference combined with what he said under oath to Franken is enough for any normal AG in any normal administration to be forced to resign.
Why does this bot exist?
Hard evidence is what the investigation is for.  There's more than enough circumstantial evidence to justify that investigation.
And here it is.\n\n[Happily talk re: my contact w Mr. Putin & his associates, took place in '03 in full view of press & public under oath. Would you &your team?](https://twitter.com/SenSchumer/status/837730437564936192)
The prevailing reasoning seems to be because it took blue collar jobs out of the country.  Which might be true, but rejecting globalism now isn't going to bring those jobs back because automation is now the culprit, not globalization.
Common card rewards above 5 wins are 100% the reason I don't regularly play arena.  Every now and then I'll give it another try, and maybe get a few runs it.  As soon as I get a common card reward above 5 wins I remember why I stopped and avoid arena for another 3+ months.
Good call.
Sure, but it takes a different note when it changes from "Russia interfered with our elections," to "Russia conspired with a US Political party to swing the election in their favor."
17 minute old troll account. /r/politics mods, can we really not get a threshold of some sort for posting eligibility to clean up the trash like this?
[Here is a good one.](http://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/3/3/14792942/sessions-flynn-kislyak-timeline)
He explicitly said he had no communications with Russia.  Not that he didn't have any communications with Russia as a Trump surrogate.  \n\nIf you're asked point blank, under oath, if you had communications with somebody, why not just say, "I did in this role but not in that role," unless you're trying to hide it?
Pretty sure he vehemently denied the Russia connections that he's now calling to investigate, as well.
Agree completely.  If people want to dispute a specific point an article makes that's fine, but to just come into a thread re: some news article from a credible source, and dismiss it as fake news, should be a reportable/deletable/bannable offense IMO.
He can't because he's lying.  [At one point in October of last year the FBI commented that they couldn't find links or ties between Trump and Russia **so far**.] (https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/01/us/politics/fbi-russia-election-donald-trump.html?_r=0)  And ozric is misrepresenting that everywhere he can to say that the FBI cleared the Trump campaign.\n\n
"I did not have communications with the Russians." -Jeff Sessions\n\nCut and dried.
Weird, this is a *different* 12-hour old troll account replying.  /r/politics really needs to clean up the troll/bot accounts.  It's an epidemic.
>Law enforcement officials say that none of the investigations **so far** have found any conclusive or direct link between Mr. Trump and the Russian government.\n\nThat does not mean they have "cleared" them.  So I'll say it once again.  \n\nLOL, fake news.  Liar.\n
Party over country.  That's it.
Exactly, get some more on the record denials and then blow those up as well.

It's an awful attempt at deflection.  Deflect to some other scandal or something unrelated to Putin/Russia.  Don't try to equivocate.  Now Schumer just needs to acknowledge this meeting and say now why did you deny that Sessions & Flynn were meeting with the Russians when we know they were?\n\nBut nobody ever accused Trump of being smart.
You're right.  Corrected.  Thanks.
Go back to your safe space, snowflake.
Pretty sure when we got some other recent FBI info disclosure it was explained that these types of data dumps from FOIA requests are done on a first-in-first-out basis, so the timing doesn't necessarily correspond to anything else happening.  I don't really know if what I'm saying is accurate though so it'd be nice if someone smarter than me could confirm that.
Does this mean if I get to 20mil circuits while playing with a mod on, then start a new game mod-free, I'll get the Steam achievement at that point in time?
Sentence is a little confusing, probably because of twitter-length phrasing.  He's saying his contact with Putin & associates, which took place in 2003 in full view of the press and public, is something he'd happily discuss today, under oath.  Would Trump & Sessions do the same?

Human trafficking is a very serious problem.

lol, 1 minute account.  Impressive.
OK. I believe you're a T_D sycophant, sycophant.
Interesting take.  Basically, even the most feasibly innocent interpretation of the Trump/Russia connection is still fraught with problems for Trump.\n\n>Here's the big final point. Let's assume some version of my narrative above is accurate. On its face its mainly about bad priorities and bad values. But anyone trying to make this chain of events happen in real life - not just Trump but his various business associates, hangers-on and supporters - would have a very difficult time not committing a large number of bad acts in the process. Maybe very bad acts. It may not be inherent in the storyline. But it's just the way that world works, especially when you have a principal who has a vast ability to justify what satisfies his self-interest, his desires, his need to dominate and be right. As we've already seen, even the fairly innocent stuff is hard not to lie about. Eventually that will get someone in trouble. There's too much dirty money, too many things that may be narrowly legal but need to be lied about, too many scams and bad actors.\n\nAnd this is with going out of your way to interpret things as benignly as possible.
Yeah, this isn't necessarily evidence of anything, it's just plain weird.  Even if we accept that he is the focal point of contact between the Trump campaign and Putin re: DNCLeaks and softening Russian relations, it still doesn't make any sense to not attend the DNC.  The Russians couldn't have been sure that DNCLeaks would be enough to put Trump over the top, so why not just hedge for a Trump loss and attend DNC convention?\n\nStrange.
I think a lot of people are starting to realize our current battle isn't left wing vs right wing.  It's traitors who have sold out our country to Putin and Russia vs patriots.\n\nAfter we get the traitor out of power we can figure out the left vs right details.
Are you saying you don't care that the President is a traitor to our country, because he's a Republican?
Great bit from the article:\n>Try to imagine the reaction of Republicans if the proverbial shoe were on the other foot–if Hillary Clinton, Barack Obama, or some similar Democrat had been tainted with strong evidence of collaborating with the Russians to win the election. And if, following that, they refused to divulge their financial ties or their campaign’s contacts with the Russian state.  Imagine if their denials turned out time and time again to be outright lies. And then just try to imagine the Democrats in Congress deliberately refusing to investigate such accusations.\n\n>The Republicans would call it Treason. And they’d be right.
You're right, this is a hilarious stretch. Pilot benefits no more than any other gas company in the state under this bill.
Yeah, McMullin is what the conservative party should look like.  People you can disagree with, but at least respect their positions and understand where they are coming from.\n\nNot the monstrosity we have today.

I agree with you, trust and verify.  But I think it's silly to hold a mistake the NYT made over a decade ago against them so strongly now.  Saying the NYT is conducting a war against the people is absurd rhetoric.\n\nThey're a source of media, trying to do their best.  Read them.  Verify what they're saying.  But know they're a media organization trying their best to provide people with insightful and accurate news, not an organization conducting a "war on the people."
I have no idea what new evidence they've found.  All I know is the claim made by you that "The Trump campaign has already been cleared by the FBI" is a blatant misrepresentation of the facts.
"I did not have communications with the Russians."  -Jeff Sessions\n\nI'd say the way that puts you under threat of perjury charges is the weird way to respond to the question.\n\nThe full context is in the video on twitter linked above.  It's clear as day.
I am fairly sure this qualifies as a personal attack.  Reported, just to be sure.

Literally everyone.
To be fair, neither was Trump until the Rosneft money.
Previously posted by this guy:\n>You're wrong, and laughably so. The American people soundly rejected Hillary and the failed policies of the Democrat party. Trump did not 'lose by millions of votes'. That's false and a fine example of fake news.\n\nCan we have a reportable category for 1 - blatant lies/propaganda, and 2 - calling real news "fake news?"

>Goodwill responded, “I can understand that. We’re not there yet.”\n\n"Yet."  I mean... why aren't these people in jail?
Besides that, Putin is too smart to just trust that a guy like Trump is going to benefit off their dealings to become president, and then keep his side of the deal when there's no longer any reason for him to do so.  Putin would only enter into an arrangement like this if he had a guarantee of Trump's future cooperation.
Wasn't it Kushner with Flynn at the December meeting?  Vacation is correct above, I mean the first meeting, at the RNC, in July.
That's what's so nefarious about the NHL's repeat offender system.  Malkin can throw borderline hits all the time, and he'll never get suspended for them.  And because he has never been suspended for his hits, he won't be suspended for future borderline hits.\n\nOTOH pop a guy like Manning with a suspension for a borderline hit, and now he's a repeat offender with a target on his back.  Next time he does anything questionable they refer back to this suspension and give him another suspension.
Stop lying.
Then why lie about them?

Please provide the economic impact report on their thinking.\n\n>  the fact that they are also building a water park, is another profile-raising type of thing for the city\n\nYes, because people are going to suddenly flock to Nashville because of a water park exclusive to one hotel that is 20 minutes away from Broadway. This is such a stretch I'm having trouble taking you seriously. \n\nI'm not saying this is a bad deal necessarily. But nobody has really made a good case why they deserve tax incentives for a fucking water park that the taxpayers will likely never get the opportunity to see. All we have are fuzzy "numbers," without any context.\n\nThis city would do well to be incredibly discerning in terms of doling out tax incentives. 
People read 12th and Broad?
Confirmed: Newsome is made of 100% gristle.
The larger points are:\n\n1) Clinton didn't get Saudi cash\n\nand\n\n2) It isn't unusual for the Saudis to donate to charities
True. I just don't want folks to think this is some sort of insane deal or pricing error that they should pounce on.
So you're content to let this fly, despite having zero assurances that their numbers are even close to correct? And what "professional study" are we talking about, if you haven't even seen it?\n\nI mean, cool. I guess I have higher standards for how our tax dollars (and incentives) should be spent. And fuck me for wanting evidence to support such incentives, amirite?
The topic: "Why Ohio State's **Passing Game** Struggled to Take Flight in 2016"\n\nJT was not impressive passing against us by any metric. I didn't say anything about any other aspect of it.\n
No doubt. I think we were all kinda shocked at how he appeared to have regressed this last season, but you're right that there are some extenuating circumstances.\n\nI expect him to be greatly improved this upcoming year, which... not yay.\n\n
Well, at least our shitshow loss against you guys has become more\n\n#QUALITY
You should probably ask your doctor instead of anonymous folks on reddit.
I disagree with just about everything you have written on the subject, but I'm glad we've had a constructive dialogue on this.
Agreed. And I get the nervousness. It's just... *every year* we get these scare bills that disappear. Sometimes I wonder if they're designed to distract from more nefarious bills that do get traction.
> if there was additional information about it being a net gain for the economy, would you still oppose it based on community access?\n\nPossibly, but I'd be more inclined to be OK with it. It really depends.\n\nI'm growing more and more concerned that Nashville is becoming a playground for the wealthy, so it gets my hackles up a bit from that perspective. But if they have a good case showing that the city would financially benefit from it, I'd probably be OK with it.\n\nThe analogy to Nissan isn't very apt. The full HQ wasn't there before, so that's an influx of not just new *visitors,* but residents. That's a far easier sell to me than some water slides that only one hotel's guests can access -- so long as any incentives are accompanied by conditions to protect the city. There have been far too many cases of cities/states giving incentives only to get screwed in the end when a company pulls out or renegs on part of a deal.\n\nHonestly, the default should be to prove the case that the incentive will benefit the city given how many times taxpayers have gotten screwed. Here's just one of many good stories showing how incentives don't always produce the desired outcome: http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/watchdog/ct-illinois-corporate-tax-breaks-met-20151002-story.html\n\n> Illinois' flagship job program has awarded millions of dollars to companies that never hired an additional employee.\n> \n> It's doled out millions more in tax breaks for corporations that eliminated jobs and became smaller.\n> \n> And it's allowed companies to reap lucrative rewards and then relocate to other states without penalty or repayment.\n\nThere's good reason to be skeptical of such deals.

R-- wait... They're cool.\n\nChrist almighty.
I really hope he sticks with us. I can't even imagine what that kid will do for us.
It's worse when you look at the partisan divide. Something like 80% of Republicans approve of him.\n\nDisapproval is really meaningless until those numbers start dropping. Then we'll be likely to see change in 2018.
I mean... sure... but you could say that about literally anyone in the universe. I've seen nothing from her to indicate she's interested in jacking up taxes at all. If anything, she's lacked a bit in big-picture ambition that would even require a tax increase.\n\nIf you have evidence to the contrary, I'd love to see it. Otherwise, it's just baseless speculation that doesn't really add much to the conversation.
Yes, that was also good. However, this legislature remains "batshit crazy." On the issue of internet, see municipal broadband expansion efforts.
> I see that nowhere in the article. \n\nPerhaps you need to read the first article in this two-part series, then. Here's the first one (in which he also grabbed her hair and placed it over her breasts, indicating the type of picture he'd like to see of her): http://www.newschannel5.com/news/newschannel-5-investigates/cops-indecent-requests-caught-on-secret-recordings\n\n> Wut? She was afraid to report it, except for that's what she did.\n\nAgain, from the first article:\n\n> Did she ever say "stop it"?\n> \n> "No," she acknowledged.\n> \n> Why not?\n> \n> "Maybe because of who he is, maybe because of the things I know about Frank, maybe because I was scared, maybe because I didn't know what to do -- he's an officer of the law."\n\nMoving on.\n\n> Would your opinion change if it was her who initiated the sexual nature of the relationship by sending him unrequested nudes?\n\nI mean, perhaps. But I don't see anywhere that there's evidence other than his word and even the officer's boss didn't believe him. Still, even if she did send nudes, that doesn't equal some binding contract where she admits to be treated however he wants forever and ever.\n\nAnd, again, the standards of conduct of a fucking police officer *in full uniform and on duty* are far higher than a convenience store clerk. Which is another good point. This motherfucker shouldn't be doing *any* of this shit *while on duty.*
Proximity to family on the West Coast. Nothing negative at all.\n\nBest of luck to him, he's a true talent.
Also might want to see if TDS is available in your area. I had them in Mt. Juliet and it was the best cable/internet I've ever had.
> not content as much as I don't think offering tax incentives makes this a bad idea\n\nI agree. I just want a good explanation.\n\n> i don't know why the presumption is that this is such a shitty deal\n\nBecause it largely excludes taxpayers from enjoying the park and... we haven't had a good explanation.\n\nIt's like... you're inclined to believe it, because they said it was good. I'm the opposite when it comes to corporate welfare. Show me the benefit and then I'll consider supporting it.
Perhaps because we're better at both the playing of and the recruiting aspects of football?\n\nAnd because 3rd in the East division is better than 1st in the West?
Probably depends on the purity and how you cut it. I mean, do you bake up some crack cookies, or do you sell it as powder for the more white-collar dopers? And on the heroin side, you'd best really cut it with something innocuous -- heroin is much stronger than it used to be and you want it to go farther. You know, *really* hook them.\n\nWait, was that what you meant?
I think a Purdue win should make us a lock, quite frankly. We're sitting at 27 on Kenpom, so assuming we beat Rutgers, that'd put us in fringe Top 25 territory, which in a sane universe would put us in somewhat comfortably.\n\nBut yes, Rutgers, Purdue and either 1 more win or a good B1G tourney performance would make me feel far more comfortable.
Fuck that. This line tells you everything you need to know:\n\n> Long ordered Geisenhoffer to stay out of Restrepo's market unless she called for help. \n\nIf the guy can't be fucking trusted to patrol an area within his area of responsibility, then he shouldn't be a cop.\n\nHis actions are absolutely an abuse of police powers. The woman was afraid to report anything because he was a cop. He was able to do as much as he did *because* he was a cop.\n\nHis actions are 100% "conduct unbecoming of an officer." Fireable in any department, regardless of whether it's an explicit or implicit abuse of police powers. The chief found him guilty of *three* policy violations. \n\nThe guy is an embarrassment and how can we trust that he'll treat female victims properly, since he's acted this way? And if I'm a defense attorney, I'm absolutely using these stories any time he's on the fucking stand to kill his case. I'd destroy his credibility in seconds.\n\nSorry, the guy should never be allowed to wear a badge again.\n
> Most people see Trump's campaign through the lens of the media who hates him.\n\nBullshit. We see it through his words, actions and insane Twitter account.\n\nQuit making excuses for him. He doesn't need your help since that appears to be 95% of what he does in his free time.
We will indeed. Tyrone Wheatley Jr. is a monster and Bunting will be good, too.\n\nBummed to lose him, but he should be where he's happy.
Perhaps you should find a different doctor, then.\n\nWe don't know the extent of your injury, the circumstances around your recovery, etc. 
I question not only the return, but also the value of offering incentives for something that your citizens generally cannot get access to (without springing for a hotel room). And wouldn't the return be guaranteed to be larger if they opened it up to everyone?\n\nWhy are they limiting the return on it?\n\n> so there must be a net benefit to the city to be willing to accept that.\n\nThe fact that we have to speculate is probably the first warning sign that this is a shaky deal.
GG Rutgers, you guys are going to be a real threat the next 2 years. Will be interesting to see.
Can't tell if sarcastic... but just in case, the Clinton Foundation took money (in 2008), not Hillary Clinton. Candidates can't accept foreign donations for campaigns and she doesn't draw a salary from the Foundation. A Foundation, which I might add, advocates for women's rights that are antithetical to what Saudi Arabia is today. And the Saudis give to more than just the Clintons. See: [McCain Foundation](https://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2016-03-31/mccain-linked-nonprofit-received-1-million-from-saudi-arabia), and [aid for Katrina.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_response_to_Hurricane_Katrina)\n\nIf sarcastic, at least maybe I explained it for someone who didn't know. If not sarcastic, you really need to read up on this shit instead of relying on crap sources.
124 yards, 1 INT and 0 TDs against us isn't exactly an incredible passing performance. That's fewer yards than our team allowed on average for the year (142.5 ypg).\n\nObviously they beat us, but stay on-topic here, bruh.
Clearly it was a suicide.
Let's not hyperventilate, just yet. Every year, a cache of insane bills are filed. Any legislator can file any insane bill. And there are always insane ones. \n\nMost never even get out of committee.\n\nHB 1406 and 33 haven't even been *heard* in committee yet. 1046 has no co-sponsors. 33 has one co-sponsor.\n\nLet's worry about these if they get traction in committee, first, or start attracting a ton of co-sponsors.\n\nThis is a pretty cheap news "story" with a bullshit clickbait headline (shocking, I know, coming from Salon).\n\nYes, they're shitty bills. But they're ludicrously short of the state declaring "open war" on anyone.
This is basically /r/theydidthemath territory. I think someone needs to take a much closer look at that $4.6 million they're projecting.
Based on what?
We'd actually probably have lower taxes if more people defended the IRS and it was allowed to fully do its job...
I mean, political engagement is good at all levels, no doubt. But saying this is "declaring war" is some breathless hyperbole at this point. As of right now, these bills have zero apparent momentum.\n\nIf everything is an emergency, nothing is an emergency.\n\n
Fuck that dissenting judge, btw.
Hell yeah!\n\n^(although I'm 100% fine with just winning because Purdue shit the bed)

It's understandable. Who knows what Trump even means half the time.

That's a worthy goal. Unfortunate he's working against a batshit crazy legislature hell bent on kowtowing to cable companies, but hopefully he gets some traction with these efforts.
I think it's safe to assume that since he blames everyone else for everything that he's blaming the military here. Perhaps if he weren't continually making excuses he'd deserve the benefit of the doubt, but he is a habitual excuse-maker.
Unless you live in one of their initial rollout apartment complexes, it's probably best not to get your hopes up of seeing residential Google Fiber until probably 2019.

Agreed. As much as I don't want to play against him next season, I'd suggest any kid who is a lottery or near-lottery lock to just make the jump. Everyone in college athletics is one ACL tear away from being a kid wondering what the hell to do with a sports science undergraduate degree.

Neither is giving the TBI full run of police shooting investigations, particularly since all of their investigations are 100% confidential and not subject to FOIA rules, meaning zero chance for the public to determine whether it was a fair, thorough investigation.\n\nI'll take body cameras over TBI involvement any day of the week.
plz
Exactly. The guy has zero reputation for accountability.
> Unless you're saying that your preference is that he should never be allowed to be employed anywhere ever again.\n\nNot as a police officer, at least. Police officers should be held to a far higher standard than most other jobs since they can take not just your rights, but life away.
> Debate is good.\n\n(*in British voice*)\n\nNo it's not.
That's a bit misleading. This thing was never more than [about $45 on Amazon.](https://camelcamelcamel.com/Sandisk-Ultra-flash-drive-SDCZ48-128G-A46/product/B00OVX3H52)\n\nYou are most certainly not saving $95. It's a decent-looking price compared to other retailers currently, but not even the lowest price Amazon has had it at.\n\nMisleading MSRPs should be illegal.
One more win *should* make us a lock, but I'd rather at least two to feel comfortable.

Glad to be of help! I stayed there for a long weekend and it was amazing.
Is that known, though?
Fortunately, most of these bills just kind of disappear in committee and individuals rarely have to risk much in the process.
We need to find out where and how these people were radicalized. When will white people start policing their own? Where is the condemnation from all white people?\n\nWe must defend ourselves against the threat of radical white terrorism.
You're probably right. I mean, there's no doubt that there will be efforts to walk back LGBT rights and whatnot, but I get tired of all the crazy shrieking about every batshit crazy bill that is filed.\n\nIt's truly a shame when "journalists" who should know better hype bullshit like this that is pretty unlikely to get past committee. If I'm wrong about that, I'm wrong, but my point still stands that it's absurdly early to be panicking about stuff like this.
Err, doesn't this only apply for the turn you cast it? (in other words, skip your combat step? Unless you cast it during your 2nd main, then it's "Do nothing".) Seems like it should be "Until your next turn..."

I'm concerned that this a pattern that keeps repeating itself within the Trump administration. Secret, undisclosed meetings with Russian diplomats (mainly Sergey Kislyak, apparently considered a spy by US intelligence).\n\nThere's enough there for an investigation. The Trump administration needs to realize that pretending it doesn't have any suspicious Russian ties is going to more and more of a problem.

> Odd, because at no point did I ever say that. Only that "revote right away because you don't like the results" isn't democratic.\n\nExcept you never said that.

Well,  in general the SMT games aren't really connected to each other story-wise (except for some explicit sequels) and the same holds true for the Persona spinoffs.\n\nThere are some minor references between them, but, at least storywise, you won't really miss anything by playing 5 first.\n\nThe Persona games are well liked for a few reasons:\n\nInteresting characters,  along with a "dating sim"-esque side of things  (I don't like calling it that, but you'll hear it, it's more just choosing who you want to hang out with and learn more of their story)\n\nDifficult turn-based JRPGs. Persona games (and to a greater extent the other SMT games) are difficult. You can die on random battles if you're careless or unlucky. You need to use the full extent of your skills in all battles or risk dying. Unlike a lot of JRPGs where you can just spam attack until you get to a boss.

Right... but what about the rest of what you said?\n\nThe point under contention is ""Keep voting until you get the results you want" isn't democracy."\n\nAt what point does it become democratic to repeal something? You seem to imply (and are having difficulty defending) that laws and decisions should never change.
Lin-Manuel Miranda is best known for writing/acting in Hamilton.
Listen, you're confused,  I get it. But we're not talking about the election, we're talking about the president's unpopularity and his *extreme* lack of support.\n\nHere's some polls:\nhttp://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/other/trump_favorableunfavorable-5493.html\n\nGo ahead, read them, ask questions (and yeah, before you ask, a 42% approval rating is *really bad for an incoming president*)
Except neither him nor I made the original claim that you wanted a source for.\n\nAre you actually looking for a source or just trolling?
I like [[Cerodon Yearling]]/[[Bull Cerodon]].\n\nThe reddest keyword ability and the whitest keyword ability.
My hope is that "Trumpist" is a label that sticks to people long after being one becomes socially unacceptable.\n\nBasically, I want those who support Trump's ideology to be punished for their support long after Trump himself is put down.
To quote MLK, I'm not interested in the "negative peace which is the absence of tension". I prefer "a positive peace which is the presence of justice". Simply put, protests need to be disruptive, loud, and uncomfortable. If they're not, no ones going to pay attention and nothings going to change.\n\nDon't let the status quo tell you what to do.
So... you're boss will fire you for something that's not your fault if someone did it on purpose, but not on accident?\n\nYou're not making any sense.
It's not an insult. It's a concern.
Jesus Christ you are a child.\n\nYou honestly don't see the problem with this, do you?\n\nI'm just going to block you and move on. I said rational, decent people couldn't defend him and I guess I was right.

Hmm, turn 3 hasty Phyrexian Dreadnought is the best I can think of at first glance.
Are you sure? Here's a quote from a "Eternal for the MTG Player" guide.\n> The opponent will have a chance to respond with spells after you declare attacking units. After blockers are declared, there is another chance for both players to respond with spells again starting with the player whose turn it is. After this point, combat damage will happen and it will proceed back to the current player for the remainder of their turn, like MTG’s post-combat main phase
You said that the "fundamental rules of federal elections are a matter of federal laws", which is explicitly not the case, as I pointed out.\n\nThe Constitution is very clear on this. The states could vote to allocate their electoral college votes by coin flip if they wanted to.\n\nI'm not sure why you don't understand this? Do you agree that we should follow the Constitution?
Just so the mods know, posts about CPAC are not off-topic.\n\n>Private political actions and stories such as demonstrations, lobbying, candidacies and funding and **political movements, groups** and donors.\n\nCPAC is very much a political group, mods.
> Though, it does kind of annoy me that fast spells don't actually serve as interrupts. Equipping a creature should be vulnerable to my instant-speed disruption, in my opinion. But other than that one small gripe, I just think this game is slick.\n\nI wanna comment on this real quick. This, to me, is probably the biggest area Eternal improves on MtG. How many playable Auras are there in MtG?\n\nPretty much none^**, *because* you can kill the creature before the enchant hits and get an easy 2-for-1. The way Eternal does it,  removal is still useful, but Auras (Weapons) are actually playable.\n\n\n**Bogles comes to mind, but the whole reason it works is because you can't kill the Bogle in response. Also some decks work by cheating out enchantments (once again, usually bypassing any opportunity to respond).
I mean, not really. It's a great movie and a great adaptation, but they had to leave out some pretty key points.\n\n[Spoilers about JDatE](#s "Namely Monster Dave is completely left out")
Uhh, I meant "Sorry?" as in "Pardon me, could you elaborate?"
Yeah, you've shown yourself, Trumpist.\n\nYou can go now.
If you read my whole post, I was merely pointing out that you are just being misleading in order to further Trump's narrative.
Not 100% sure this works.\n\nCould reword it more like Animate Dead, maybe, but I hope the simplicity here works.
That sounds like a bug/misreading.\n\nAre you sure he cast his spell after the declare blockers step? (And not after the declare attackers step)\n\nAre you sure you had a priority window when he cast his spell? (Or did you pass after the declare blockers step, he cast his spell, which gave you a priority window?)
[[Shivan Dragon]] might be in the running.\n\nIt's an iconic fantasy creature and has been printed like, a dozen times. \n\n[[Serra Angel]] might have a shot now that I think of it for similar reasons.
Not only is the PS4 region free, but SRWV is actually getting an English release! (via the Asia release version, so you'll still have to import)
Remember everybody, only protest in normal, government-approved ways. A good protest is a quiet protest! We wouldn't want to upset the status quo!
It's... satire. I'm not sure what's confusing about this.
"Hey sorry boss, I was late because of some protesters!"\n\n"Yeah, well I can't afford you to be late! Now I have to fire you, hire someone else, train them, and let them know if they slip up in the slightest they're fired. I can afford that."
What about the (non-alternative) fact that he lost by 3 million votes?  How could he *not* be the most unpopular incoming president?
In order for an aura to be attached to a target, it must be a legal target per its "Enchant [whatever]" ability.\n\nNote something like Daybreak Coronet:\n>\tIf all other Auras attached to the enchanted creature stop enchanting it, Daybreak Coronet will be attached to an illegal permanent and will be put into its owner’s graveyard.\n\n\nThe "this effect doesn't remove CARDNAME" clause exists on cards that give protection to the aura's color, but I'm not sure it works on something like this since it's an issue with the "Enchant [whatever]" ability and not something defined in the actual rules (Protection).
Eh, if this is overpowered, what is Scythe Tiger?\n\nThey both effectively cost you a land drop, but the tiger has +1/+0 and shroud.
I don't know, there's plenty of RR creatures that are 2/2\n\nhttp://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?action=advanced&color=+[R]&type=+[%22Creature%22]&cmc=+=[2]&mana=+=[RR]&power=+=[2]&tough=+=[2]\n\nPretty much all of them have substantial upsides as well, better than this, I think. \n\nRed gets a lot of efficient, aggressive creatures. Goblin Guide, Zurgo Bellstriker, plenty of 2/1s, some 2/2 with downsides (usually "can't attack unless X"). All of which just cost R.\n\nI don't think red getting a 3/2 for RR is that big of a deal.\n\nEDIT: Forgot about Borderland Marauder, which is basically a 3/2 for 1R at common.
Sorry?
Could Game 2 be Gunstar Heroes?\n\nIt's a Genesis game, but the last stage is a boardgame where you roll dice.\n\nhttp://3.bp.blogspot.com/-v3_lWTY5JaY/To0HMQPrXRI/AAAAAAAAJjg/tqitdBLtb4g/s1600/Gunstar_Heroes_%2528Gen%2529_35.png
You have a 3/3 and your opponent attacks with two prized unicorns.
Wait, what? Seriously? This seems like such a bizarre oversight.\n\nWhy wouldn't you want to play a fast spell after Declare Blocks? That's when you're supposed to play pump spells. And then in response, your'e opponent might want to play removal. This is incredibly common in MtG, where the onus is on the Active Player to "tip their hand".
He also [runs a business](https://www.reddit.com/r/Dallas/comments/5su7ri/dallas_county_passes_resolution_welcoming/ddipe1b/)!\n\nWonder how he finds the time to be a douche on reddit.
Well, that's something I guess.
What's the time limit on that though?\n\nObviously repeals are a part of democracy, we don't just let bad things stay the way they are forever. (prohibition, slavery, etc.)\n\nI know Brexit hasn't technically happened, but some effects of the vote are clearly negative and unpopular. I have a hard time understanding how the majority wanting something isn't democratic.

Are there... *Oscar truthers* now?\n\nJesus Christ, I need a break.
So... that's a "no" on the source then?\n\nOr is it... "nyet", comrade?
So... is the conspiracy that this is false? Or something?\n\nOr this just Trump propaganda on /r/conspiracy some more?
If someone gets in a traffic accident, blocking traffic, and causes you to be late (basically the same thing as protesting blocking traffic), is it his fault? Or is it your employer for not understanding that sometimes shit happens and you are late?
The problem is that in 2018 specifically, we have 23  (+2 independents) Democrats up for re-election and only 8 Republicans. (And of those 8, most are pretty safe).
Now this makes sense (from a MtG perspective).\n\nIf you kill a creature that is blocking your creature, your creature is still blocked.
> 9th circuit who has over a 75% overturn rate \n\nJust so people have the non-alternate facts on this.\nhttp://www.snopes.com/ninth-circuit-court-most-overturned/\n\nBasically, every court has at least 55% of their cases brought before the SC overturned. And that more than 99% of cases *total* aren't overturned by the SC (either upheld or just not brought up).\n\nAnd the 9th doesn't even have the highest overturn rate.
> How's about "longer than immediately after its happened."\n\nI mean, it's been about 8 months since the vote, so I'd say we're definitely there.\n\n>Or when actual public opinions shift, rather than just political commentators and politicians demanding it? The majority still want it.\n\nPoliticians wanting a re-vote actually sounds like a decent system to me, since them calling for a re-vote would then be used during their re-election campaign (for better or worse).\n\nAlso, you might want to look up what majority means again. None of those polls crack 50%.\n\n>If you want a set time frame, how about you tell me how short it can be until you're just revoting until you get the results you want?\n\nHey, man, you're the with the irresponsible position of "nothing can change ever". Don't put forth a position if you're incapable (or unwilling) to defend it.
Do you have the g1/2 PP and charge enhanced g5 PD?
1)  first I have seen of this exploit, it is easier to raise massive awareness / get fdev to investigate by posting here.    \n\n2) how is this exploit out of lore? This is just some oceans 11 type stuff.  He found a gap in the security of the station and can use that to exact his final revenge.  "A rogue outlaw has recently discovered a hole in the security of coriolis stations.  Please be advised that until we are able to patch the hole in the security of the station you will be assuming your own risk by docking."  That isn't to say it shouldn't be fixed, but I don't think this is super outside the relm of something that could actually happen to a station. \n\n3) this exploit is much less worse than the 17 draconis skimmer.  But it is with ceos sothis.  In that it is a broken mechanic but not outside of something that could be lore okay while fdev fix the issue.  
Would love to be able to walk the observation deck of the beluga and have npc passengers walking around too.  Maybe have a pool or some sort of resort feel at the observatiom deck.  Would further solidify the beluga as my favorite ship.   \n\nEdit:  I would honestly rather pay a commander with a beluga to take me to another ship of mine. Then have the ship flown to me.  Would be awesome to be on the observation deck.  Make the trip much cheaper cost for me, but a nice mission reward for the beluga pilot.  Downside, slower and if his ship is interdiction and killed I go back to origin spaceport.  Pro, get to sit on a bad ass observation deck and see the universe. 
Guy I ran cross country with did a 4:08.  But he won state track 2 times for team in high school and won the 800 like all four years. To my knowledge he still holds the Florida high school record for the mile. \n\nEdit: no longer holds state record.  But the record stayed in city.  
Wait, seriously? That's really sad if true.  I come hear to laugh at stupidity and getting hurt, not people dying. :( don't even really want people seriously hurt... \n\n
Yeah, I have plenty of money from passangers, so don't really need massacre right nwo.  Just want rank, but the massacre missions are flowing right now
Which grade? G1 got me 18% increase on the powerplant
Really? How long does civil unrest last? I can't play for an hour or so!
Yeah my boosters alone add like 30 tons
So for davs hope I can just take my dumbfire asp there? Blow stuff up then collect the sweet rewards?
I am in ceos sothis.  Sothis has massacre missions. So it is a slower rank grind but gobs of money.  
There's the problem.  G1 gives like 18%, g2 can roll mid 20s.  You should use those and then use module priority, and turn off stuff you don't need.  G5 runs super hot.\n\nEdit: just take 30 sulphur to farseer, and keep rolling till you hit 17 or 18% on the g1. 
If this helps, I have more fun fighting in the courier.  I do the super boost PA build, and it is a lot of fun.  
What's up with all the gold?
No, it's because he also used executive memos, which carry more or less the same power but aren't reported.  So when you combined order and memo. Then Obama definitely won.  \n\nE: http://i.imgur.com/fgN9H8v.png  
I run a cutter with 8a prismatic g5 and 5 boosters at g3.  I am rocking like 55-6000 mj
As others have said, it increases massively.  I finished both cutter and corvette grinds and it took like 3-4 missions for 1%.  Feels like I would stack all 20 missions and get 2% change. Advice I give for grinds, is if you are set on grinding shoot for like 5% per session then go do your "main" activity.  I did data missions for like an hour, then went to farm has rez or the likes.
I lost 80 lbs in 6 months, I was 240 at 5 9.  Have been about 170 for 2 years but got down to 160.  You will looks fine after 50 pounds. I have no loose or hanging skin
No, insurance wants me to take out a ship that is responsible for killing others.  If someone has a bounty, then the 5 million payout to the killing commanders is a discount for how much they had to pay out to cover those the killing pilot killed.  \n\nEdit for clarity.  Pilot 1 has killed 10 noobs of all ship types including explorers.  Pilot 2 kills pilot 1 to collect bounty.  Insurance would rather pay a fee of 5 million to pilot 2 than cover the cost of all ships killed by pilot 1 (which is probably well over 5 million. Aspx is like 1 mil rebuy plus all the value of lost exploration data.  Noon conda, is what 7 mil?) So killing 5 explorers would make it a better option to pay out for the killing of pilot 1.  
Like I just told the other guy, have a fully modded cutter, but now that I know how to FA off and actually fly, I am going to focus the corvette grind 100% then engineer the hell out of it.  My anaconda already has a 45 ish% fsd, so the most important upgrade is already ready. 
I'm 44% warrant officer, trying to grind out corvette.  Is 300 million enough to grind the rest of the ranks for corvette? Planning on doing 200k and less donations. \n\nQuestion 2.  Where is the best donations hub? I checked tun tonight, but everything is down due to elections.  
3-2-1 of file storage.  Make 3 copies in two different places at least one offline. \n\nMy system is desktop, cloud, thumbdrive, and printed off copies I place in sheet protectors.  
When ever I have played with people doing have to win matches, if they aren't absolutely dominating by 10 minutes they f6.  They don't want to risk a close game and lose after 30-40 minutes.  So then they become f6 toxic
Skimmer missions for the 17 draconian exploit gave combat rank.  So I'm guessing they got a billion, then spammed donation missions.  
That's kind of it though, tonight seemed like a pretty cold night. Because they relied on dunks from the bigs or "chucking it up".  If fsu can pull out that win it is a great sign.  Louisville is a very good team, even without your point guard. Not saying they will make the final four, but not gonna say quite what you did either.  This fsu seems very consistent too. Not a "live by the 3 or die by the 3" team.  
Make sure to get fixed on the slf.  Helps when chaff comes out, that way your slf can still help shred shields.  
Didn't feel like reading everything, but a great qb can take no names and make them great wr. Read: Brady and everyone he throws to.  Drew Brees has never thrown to a pro bowler and puts up godlike numbers.  \n\nI'm saying if you are a great qb you are great, but I'm also saying if you have the best line in the league you will probably put up very good efficiency stats.  Winston had a huge rookie year, and only player to start with 2 4k yard seasons.  That was bolstered by the run game. \n\nIn conclusion, he is a good qb that benefited from the best oline in the league.  It wouldn't surprise me if he had a slump once that line is no longer the best line in the league.  
How does this work? Go in with ship and shoot everything. Then drop in srv and pick up mats? 
Obamas lowest deficit was higher than bushes highest deficit. And bush increased deficit from 2001-2004, then they decreased quite a bit till 2008 as a response to the economy to about 400-500B, then it ballooned to the massive deficit in 2009 (which Obama voted for so he is also partly responsible for that deficit).  But since the economy has improved according to Obama the deficit hasn't been as low as bush's highest.  I don't really like using deficit as the end all be all comparison, but you aren't quite correct about bush v obama.  \n\n[Edit](http://www.politifact.com/punditfact/statements/2015/aug/27/occupy-democrats/liberal-group-blames-bush-raising-deficits-credits/)
Wait. You can get efficient mod on beam 4?  Gimbal led I assume? 
what if her husband is running late and she is telling her husband where she is sitting?  You just automatically assume she is a bad person?  I use Google hangouts to text my wife because it is quicker than texting on my phone. 
"Ah yes let's continue to pretend like the Democratic party of today is the same as the Democratic party of Jim Crow."\n\n"Ah yes let's continue to pretend like the white Americans of today are the same as the southern white Americans of slavery"\n\nThis is a discussion about reparations.  If we are talking about sins of our fathers then that counts. \n\n
Obama also used executive memo. Which carry more or less the same weight.  When you factor in that too he was not the lowest.   \n\nE: http://i.imgur.com/fgN9H8v.png
Along with what the other guy said, I personally will delay the rank up missions for a while because I like it when I finally rank up and I am 75% the way done with the next rank.  For me it made the grind much more bareable.  Except getting duke and rear admiral.  Getting both of those took forever.  Like 300 data missions for each...took for ever.  15 full board cycles, but waiting for the board flips probably took 5 straight hours of nonstop grind.  
Spoilers for rest of the show...click with care. Like everything remaining in the show after this. [Robins mom wasn't going to attend her wedding to barney.  So when Ted was telling Tracy the story of how Robins mom actually showed up, Tracy said what she said in the image.  Well, as we find out later, Tracy has terminal illness, so when Tracy says "what mother wouldn't show up to her daughters wedding?" Ted cries because Tracy won't make it to their own daughters wedding, because they both know she is dying.  That is why it was such a big deal that Tracy hear every story Ted has.](/spoiler) 
I run 2 huge beam, efficient 4.  Definitely recommend.  G5 charge enhanced, I can shoot like 15 seconds straight. Then it takes like 4 seconds to recharge.  If the target flies past me, by the time I swing around (g3 dirty drive) my wep are fully charged again. 
Also, I have had wing fights, me and slf vs 3.  And my slf has been able to take out the two smaller ships while I deal with the main ship.  Usually like me v anaconda, slf vs 2 sidewinders. 
That's a good catch, I love that idea.  I figured if you are a little late no big deal.  Maybe a 24 hour lock from ship transport.  If you are more than 24 hours than maybe a week or two lock with that whole superpower.  Or maybe it is a 24 hour ban, but a fairly large bounty is put on your head.  \n\nI just want me mechanics to bring together different play styles.\n\nMaybe if you accept a federation transport, you automatically get an imperial bounty.  As a way to try to destroy ships belonging to the rich. 
Your claim was bushes deficit got bigger every year and Obama got smaller every year.  I countered that, you can add all the other stuff you want but don't say bush deficit grew every single year when it didn't.... no need to lie to make your point.  Bush deficits didn't go up every year and Obama has had high deficits every single year in office than Bush ever did.   At some point Obama is responsible for deficit spending too. 
Nope, it's still investment state, which it was in this morning for me. 
I have a moderately engineered corvette if you want to practice some pvp \n\nAnd a cutter engineered to hell and back.
I am a beautiful person. I am a beautiful person.  \n\nEdit. My phone is /r/wholesomememes
That's what my plan pretty much is.  Not really even for money, but to keep the space madness away, just can't find a good donation hub.  17 draconian is like 1 donation per board flip right now
How did you get 20ly?! I barely have 23 with my cutter, on coriolis beta with the mods I am shooting for the best I can get is like 14-16ly \n\nEdit: coriolis, not inara.  I use the updated coriolis so I can plug in my mods
/r/whatcouldgowrong /r/wellthatsucks are great material for this sub
Yeah, why is the most expensive item in the least secure pocket? Like a toy gets the super nice pocket, the iPhone gets the "permanently almost falling out" pocket. 
Curious, what would you consider hillary? 
I use two huge efficient beam (gimballed).  3 mc, and 2 small rail guns.  I run the ifighter with PA.  For 90% of my kills I don't need to shoot mcs or railguns.  Just straight beams.  \n\nI have G1 PP with a 17% roll.  G 4 reinforced prismatic, 6 g3 boosters, g3 DD, g5 charge enhanced PD. And shield cell banks.   I can shoot 22 seconds straight with the beams.  Once I pass the other ship, by the time I turn around I have full charge again on my beams.  Especially for pve, that set up is OP.  \n\nWith priorities set, I don't run in to real power issues.  Just turn off my cargo scoop, fuel scoop, and planetary vehicle.   \n\nEdit: if you have enough mats, the secondary effects on the two huge beams get stupid strong.
Considering Bush's name was thrown out in year 8 of Obama's presidency, I will give trump supports a pass for day 1.  
Oh this is a gamechanger... I have my cutter fully modded, but now that I am more comfortable flying, I am going hard on the corvette grind. 
My ancestors came at the turn of the 1900s 100% planning on integrating.  If people come here and refuse to learn the language and want to set up their own "lite" version of their home country, then I'm against it.  But if they want to learn our ways and teach us their ways then we should allow as many in as possible.  Culture is great, leaving your country to refound your country in a new place isn't as great. 
"THE hardest part for a rookie QB is the pre-snap stuff and keeping your head together and no one has done it better as a rookie."\n\nI get you are excited about your qb, but Jameis is UNBELIEVABLE about his football iq at the age he is, so let's not get carried away.  In Jameis' first year he showed that level.  So no, I am not comparing a second year player.  From day 1 Jameis was asked to do as much as I have ever seen from a rookie qb.  \n\nAgain, I am just saying that I think a lot of issues that might be apparent in qbs are hidden by that oline.  If you threw any number of qbs (that are mediocre to good) behind that line their stats would probably be inflated in the direction of efficiency. Most rookie qbs either don't start for a team (because they were taken late and that team has a qb) or if they have to start day one the team is a little bit of a dumpster fire (read: mariota, Winston).   If the qb has a lot of time in the pocket, they don't need to force as many throws like jameis, they can wait for better options.  And if you have a top 3-5 running back those efficiency stats will also go up because the opponent have to stack the box to protect against the run.  Dak had a great year, there is no denying it.  But let's not get carried away, he had the best oline in the league and a top 3-5 running back.  
This is why I bought the beta.  It allowed me to fully outfit the conda Cutter and corvette with a rated.  Also, I agree with another poster, upgrade the cutter and it will grow on you.  The corvette handles better, but there is something so inexplicably pleasing about the cutter once you upgrade. Warning though, you said spending 200 mill credits. I spent more than that on my shield.  I am about a billion into the ship.  So to truly rule the skies I recommend between 600 mil - 1 bill. 
Yeah, I saw that after my last message.  I had like 4 board flips with maybe 1 mission.  Then bam, 16 missions on one flip.  Then nothing for 10 or so
Check out my reply.  I run 2 huge beams, 3 multis, two railguns and don't have real power issues. 
Didn't vote trump*\n\nSomeone tied to the administration who ran for office who won more popular votes, I think is a very fair thing to bring up.  You(reddit) say hillary won popular vote so she should have won, then trump draws parallel to the person who people think should have won then we get upset? No one said McCain should have won, or actually won.  But people claim that for Hillary. So trump is using the person who reddit claims actually won, and reddit is now saying, but she didn't win.  Even though 2 weeks ago reddit was still complaining saying hillary should be president.  Source: /r/politics the last like month since the election.  I'm just saying reddit can't eat it's cake and have it to.
Hey man, I have a fully engineered cutter.  For the cutter the reinforced generator makes a huge difference.  I went g5 reinforced generator, I believe 3 g5 resistance augmented boosters, and 3 g5 heavy duty booster. Along with the 8a SCB and I believe 6a shield cell booster I never die.  (2 heat sinks with the extra ammo mod). Also note, I had to do a lot with module priority, and the power plant mod was like step one for me.  
Sorry, American.  But our family has letters and writings from my family when they left ireland.  And I don't know how any of them will be in 100 years, but if they come to America or Canada truly wanting to be a part of THAT country then there shouldn't be any other consideration.  However,  if they are merely leaving behind their country and want to get back to their lives but in a new country then there will probably be complications from that. 
I have really bad sinus issues and have had ear issues my whole life.  When I was very young I had really bad ear infections.  I would almost never realize I had an ear infection due to ear pain, but after it got worse it would manifest as stomach pain.  Being a parent must be terrifying. 
Yup, just found the sub. Along with the others
Cool, I'll be at sol at 1900utc.  You will know it's me because it will be the cutter with 7k shields.  Xoxo xoxo o7 \n\nEdit: been in and around sol, for an hour now.  Where are you? My shield tank cutter wants to say "what was that, was that a mosquito" to your weapons. 
It's still investment state for me, just not populating with donation missions
I went to a rough school.  For many of my friends, sports was the ONLY reason they came to school and even half assed their work.  They didn't have the money to pay for community sports.  So honestly the options were give them a goal with school sports or for several of my friends go to the gangs from the area.  Fyi, several friends got into d1-2 schools for sports and graduated, so school sports literally changed their lives. 
I did reinforced on my prismatic, then 3 boosters heavy duty, and 3 resistance augmented.  I get like 50% resistance across the board with 3.5k mj.  What grade are your boosters? 
Haha, I am used to seeing "he ded" my bad! Just trying to keep things wholesome lol
Luckily I did most of the grind already for my cutter
Which mod, I want beam but you can't do efficient, I thought
Not a big smoker, but it looks related.  But far less cheek engagement, because you need quite a bit of resistance to keep the air consistent. 
I get probably 1-2 donations per flip, then after 10 or so flips I get 20.  Still better than nothing.  Also, ceos/sothis gave me steady rank missions
I honestly learn a lot from the bitching.  For instance in this thread they said to use bowl to mix fries and oil so you don't burn the oil and have that flavor leech in.  Bitching isn't always bad.
I liked farseer because you can get g3 dirty drives, g1 power plant, and g5 fsd.  I rolled  g1 pp until I got 18% increase.  With that amount I was able to run huge beams, rest MC, 6 shield boosters, and a 7a prismatic
Hey man, I have the three big ships and have made a lot of money from trading, passangers, fightings, massacre.  I will be more than happy to wing up with you and teach you some things
I think what they meant was with faction reputation.  As you do missions for one faction you gain status. Neutral, cordial, allied etc.  As you gain rep with a faction the mission payouts get really good.  Example is massacre missions.  Before you are cordial or allied, they will be worth like 400k with killing 4 ships.  Once you are maxed with that faction (note: not rank with superpower) then you can get 5mil missions for that faction.  So 6m fully stacked at low rep vs 60-70 mil when maxed.  Super power rank doesn't really change things.  When I did my cutter grind I finished with the same old data courier missions that I did at low ranks.  If I were you, I would find a good station and grind with a specific station / factions.  The prime example is ceos / sothis for fed or wu giananani (or what ever the spelling is) and hip 107... (whatever the numbers)
Leading up to that America sent money to OneVoice, a group with the goal of peace talks.  But it turns out most of the money went to building voter databases and teaching how to get the vote out, including hiring a political firm with ties to Obama. According to the bipartisan permanent subcommittee on investigation. \n\nSo it appears America (obama administration) tried to interfere in the Israeli election and oust PM Netanyahu.  \n\nSo he came here to speak directly to Congress since he felt he was being railroaded by obama. 
This is the only thing I say on this sub.  If you are saving anything electronically follow the 3-2-1 method.  Save the items at least 3 times, in 2 different places, at least one of those offline. 
This is the best product placement of all time. https://youtu.be/lbBn-Z_V7VE
Wouldn't the pre-67 border make Israel super vulnerable to attack?  If so then that is an incredibly outrageous request.  Last time Israel gave land back was Gaza Strip.  And we know how that turned out, so asking Israel to go back to when their borders are even less defensible would be silly.  That's be like saying ISIS is willing to make peace with the US, all they want are 2 nuclear weapons.  
He wasn't the lowest when you factor in presidential memos.  Which aren't numbered or reported about as well. \n\nE: http://i.imgur.com/fgN9H8v.png
[ text ] ( / spoiler ) but remove spaces.  [Text](/spoiler)
Also doing ceos / sothis.  As I collect data missions they stop spawning.  It tanks me like 10-20 cycles of board flipping.  Massacre missions are easier for me to get right now.  Sothis is giving me 2-5 million dollar massacre missions
I think the highest you can hire at is expert.  This might be unpopular, but I hire at the highest available.  They take profits, so they only make money if you do, and if you main ship dies the crew die and you lose all progress.  I had 3 crew die that I trained from newbee.  Not really worth it for me and the amount of time I play. At expert rank and above my I fighter hardly dies.  At lower levels they die a lot.  I also never give my crew my main ship, they only pilot slfs.
He meant golf, or he is Glen beck, definitely one of those two
Just dropping in to say I agree with your choice.  Fully upgraded conda can donate most components to a corvette if you choose, but the conda can do everything really really well.  Corvette is great at fighting. But if you can get a conda and an fdl, then you are set for a while to especially learn combat for the corvette
Coriolis.edcd.io is the newer version that allows for inputting modified modules.  
Like I said, this is for pve.  My ship melts haz res.  But if you venture into pvp other builds are better.  I also super recommend specifically the ifoghter once your copilot hits elite.  I have had all 3 ships with my elite.  Ifoghter was garbage until they hit elite.  But after elite they just stick to the backside of the tsrget.  Only have them die when I take on wings of 3
Really? I was there this morning. Getting almost nothing
I got a sous vide machine for christmas, so I am doing.  \n\nBeef wellington with smashed potatoes\n\nAnd double chocolate covered strswberries. 
Was in fsu band, love the war chant every time and all 43 songs that sound almost the same but kind of different! 
Taught woodwind stuff at the college level, now I'm going to teach you all how to do circular breathing.\n\n\nNext time everyone takes a shower collect water in your mouth. Then spit the water out while you breath in through your nose. That is essentially all it is.  The difficulty is building up strength in your cheeks that perfectly match the pressure of your lungs.  \n\nSo once you master the simple step of breathing in through your nose while you slowly spit out water try to follow it up with breathing out in a steady stream. This will now mimic the switch from cheek pressure (water) and lung pressure (air).  (Added note: for me the cheek portion takes roughly one second).\n\nAs you master the constant stream of air pressure you can start to do the cheek blow without water just simply using air. (Pro tip: when trying 100% with air (no longer using water) blow through a straw, the extra resistence helps a lot.)\n\nCongrats, if you play a woodwind you can do a basic circular breathing technique.  Now like everything, the true skill is mastering it. And keeping all notes consistent through all registers and dynamics. 
Rank grind should be like engineers but with mission types.  So you travel to a different system for each rank, and each system has one mission type.  Think of it as learning from a master at that craft. (Each level of the rank would be in a different system).\n\nLevel one you are introduced to the super power with data courier missions to prove your merit (super quick rank, the rest get gradually longer), then to see if you understand basic flight you get long range hauling or ABA missions. then move to passenger missions for that faction, maybe a rank of smuggling.  Then the second to last rank is massacre of the other super power (and should assign number of ships, not have to do missions, e.g. kill 700 imperial ships  (if ranking with fed)). And the last rank should be a choose your destiny, by returning to any previous rank system and grind with them again.  This would also have the benefit of guiding people in gameplay and skills.   \n\nEdit: this system kind of follows a logical progression of what you would be trusted to do as you join an army. Messenger to master warrior.
Just take note of the optimisation in Attila though... It looks beautiful, almost cinematic, but it has been known to run considerably worse on anything but top-end machines.
James Winston will make poor decisions or try to force the ball a lot.  But he is a much higher football iq than dak.  So don't even have to look that far for a better pre snap rookie qb.   Jameis Winston last year was better.  If you put Jameis behind titans or Dallas oLine he would have been lights out. 
I think you were overly rude to the OP and didn't actually poke holes.  I am level 30, with all gods mastered and 10 diamonds, and am Plat 2 (good not great player).  I don't think you could teach me everything about the game to get me to actually understand a lot of stuff I STILL don't know.\n\nShe was probably drawn to wow because she saw pawprints, you click pawprints, something simple happened and you said "you can have pets, here are pets". That is relatively straight forward, and there isn't a ton of incredibly straight forward in smite.  If you have never played a moba even the concept of abilities can be weird. \n\nIn smite you say, you have abilities, there are 320ish abilities in game and probably 100 items, there are 5 classes, there are Melee and ranged physical, warriors and tanks, and mages but you also have burst mages, and healers.  You should build like this for mages because x y z...  this is a very steep learning curve game, I played through like level 15 before I turned off auto buy and auto level and that was only because my friends told me what to buy. I didn't buy truly on my own till level like 25.  I think OP has a point and I also think it is fairly safe to assume they stopped playing because the initial learning curve is very steep. \n\nHell, I played a conquest in ranked yesterday with a baachus picking up rod of aesclepius(sp?) Second item, with no healers in the game at all.  Again, level 30. \n\nAnd I am saying all this as someone who has a girlfriend that loves CS GO, loves WoW, has 200+ hours in fallout4, and is level 20 in smite and still barely knows what is actually going on even with me explaining.  \n\nTL:DR I think it is fair for OP to assume his friends stopped playing because of this game being complicated.
The only advice I give on this sub.\n\n3-2-1 for all file backup.  Make at least 3 copies in at least 2 different locations, at least 1 of which is offline. \n\n\nDon't let a computer crash kill your case.     \n\nDesktop, cloud, thumbdrive, and printed off and placed in sheet protectors is my method.  
I don't get them as much but still bad.  Had a physical at 21 and when the doctor looked in my ears he whispered into them "can you hear me?".  I said yes and he was amazed because apparently I had had an ear infection going for a while. Haha, I can hear, just lose some of the notes in the alto singer ranges. 
Grew up in south, every year from 1st to 8th grade had to do massive projects on slavery and civil rights.  Then through high school it was still discussed in depth.  Even the super rednecks in my school weren't racist, they just like driving their vehicles through mud.  I'm sure some people were racists but 99% were not.  We also had in depth sex education from 4th grade on, and were taught about dinosaurs and never intelligent design. 
Did one run before I was even allied with the faction.  I felt dirty.  I didn't mind ceos / sothis.  Didn't mind the broken passengers, but 17 draconis was different. 
I agree completely, I came to this sub because I was avoiding the meme magic of r/the Donald, don't let it this sub become another r/the Donald.
There's also the fact that there really isn't anywhere else you *can* post a conservative meme and not have it downvoted into nonexistence. 
>stumbled upon this sub days ago \n\nGive it some more days and you will see that an occasional post like this is totally normal here 
I dont visit r/conservative for the memes, but it's sometimes healthy to take a light-hearted approach to serious subjects. Imo it opens people up for friendlier and more good-spirited discussion after everyone has had a laugh.\n\nEverything in moderation is OK in a sense =)
Oh, good god... spare us the whiny routine about how unaccommodating this sub is to you.  Your historical contribution to this sub is generally concern trolling, which shouldn't surprise anyone coming from a person who is self-described as "fairly left wing".\n\nLook, I'm sorry that the more zealous members of your side have turned r/politics into a flaming heap of dog shit, but you aren't entitled to anything here.  And you certainly aren't the quality control inspector for all things conservative.\n\nDon't like something you see?  Go ahead and use that little down-vote button you see there on the side.  But you know what the greatest irony is lately?  The people doing the most shit-posting are people like you constantly complaining about what we conservatives enjoy in a moment of levity.  Wow!  It's like we know how to laugh and everything, too!
You should write a ban appeal. The moderators aren't unreasonable. \n\nDon't complain about memes though. I happen to love this one. It's hilarious. 
This is at least the third time I've seen this meme on this sub. Still gets me every time B)
£15m+1
oh come on, please leave this stuff for the_donald...\n\nEdit: just got banned for this comment...\n\nEdit 2: I may be fairly left wing, but I'm also strongly libertarian, passionate about constitutional freedoms and protections, and fiscally conservative. Think Dave Rubin liberal - I can be at times described as a conservative too. If you dig deeper into my posts, you will see that I have also defended Milo and argued against shareblue on politics. In real life, I have worked on conservative campaigns in local elections.\n\nFeel free to read through my post history. I try to stay generally well reasoned and fair, which I hope I do to some degree. I do not believe that a single post of mine can be considered to be a "shit post".\n\nI was happy when I stumbled upon this sub days ago, because it seemed to have interesting discussions about conservatism. While I am not the quality control inspector, I like reading well-reasoned political dialogue. I voiced my displeasure at seeing this meme, as it seems very contrary to the mission statement of "provide[ing] a place on Reddit for conservatives, both fiscal and social, to read and discuss political and cultural issues from a distinctly conservative point of view."\n\nI'm sorry that my earlier seemingly innocuous comments triggered you that much, but I think you need to recognize that a the_donald meme-spreading centipede is not the only kind of conservative out there.\n\nEdit 3: the mod is OP... I'm in all likelihood not getting unbanned. This is my last line of communication... Guess this is it for me.
On a side note, is diffusal still core on Juggernaut, or has the build meta changed? Normally I go Phase > PMS > Aquila and then straight into Diffusal, then Manta. After that, all his relevant luxury items (Butterfly, MKB)\n\nJuggernaut's not particularly tanky, so I stack agility to compensate and give him some fighting potential.
My uni had the same thing. It was nothing to worry about, but i am a local and intend to practice within my state (NSW), so this is N/A to my situation.\n\nIm going to assume that you want to go overseas at some stage? If that's the case, you would need to follow up yourself and find out what additional hoops you need to jump through to be eligible to practice in that country. It differs depending on the country.\n\nI asked my University career councillor last year about practicing in other countries. I was told that once you graduate from an Aus University, because some foreign jurisdictions are so different to ours, if you intend to practice overseas, it may require you to sit a certification test in that country. You know, because the laws may be completely different.\n\nIf you intend to find a job and practice law in Australia, nothing to worry about. This is just a disclaimer that covers the University's arse from being sued.
AP should be a one-hit-kill on fighters... :(
There's a video of Maxine Waters giving a press conference where she blames Trump's foreign policy and leniency toward Putin which is allowing " Russia to continue to advance into Korea".\n\nI turned into a snotty mess laughing when I saw it.
Same, and I'm almost always paranoid of being ganked. I think it has something to do with the expanded size and redesigns of the radiant jungle. \n\nPre-7.00, you used to only need one ward to see enemies coming from the mid-lane or river spot, generally placed just to the left-side of the lane. Now because of the multiple paths a ganker could take, you'll need a hell of a lot more wards in order to properly see them coming.
You play Dota2 to win. You don't play to get the highest K/D ratio.\n\nPlay to win. That's all that matters.
Thanks so much!\n\nAfter a little looking around online, I'll probably be instead buying the Gigabyte Z170X-Gaming 3 Motherboard. Downside is I'll have to upgrade to new DDR4 memory :(
Prior knowledge of the lore is absolutely not necessary to understand the enjoy the game. It's quite difficult to not enjoy a title that has giants, giant spiders, and feisty trigger-happy dwarves with guns. With that said, the lore is both rich and true to the table-top version in TW:W.\n\nMechanically, it's definitely up there as one of the most solid Total War Titles, maybe only second to Shogun II. A few things are definitely lacking in the game, such as dumbed-down construction trees and really mediocre province/city management, but there is great entertainment value in the game.
It all starts with jumping to the worst possible conclusion for every hypothetical social interaction you can imagine in your head.\n\nThen, you freeze up during real social interactions out of fear of the aforementioned hypotheticals. Ends up with other people thinking you're weird or too socially awkward, leading to minimised social interaction with other people.\n\nAs well as shattering what little confidence you already had, you come up with EVEN MORE outrageously stupid hypotheticals that you continue to live in fear of. It's a vicious cycle, man.\n\nEdit: Addition
Meanwhile I've had 7 consecutive losses in the past 2 days. You win some, you lose some i guess
Could have made for some EPIC multi-layered sieges. Kind of like Attila tried to do, except less shitty. It wouldn't be as bad as last total war games because of the presence of magic and flying units.\nCA pls! :D
Not all of us are like this :)\nIt's just the 1% that shames the other 99%...
Honestly I would be so happy if they went back and did "remastered" versions of some of the classic TWs... Rome 1, Shogun 2, Medieval, Empire. Just bump up the graphics engine and flesh out some of the shallower aspects of those games aaaaaaannnd that would be perfect.
How would a graphical mod disable achievements??
Nervous, been on the bench but looks tired and heavy 
If positions were determined by knowledge of football seasons and fantasy teams, 90% of us would be jobless for life. While you can pretty easily pick up on the trend and learn about fantasy football teams, what's more important is that you show some of the more important qualities of a job-seeker.\n\nOn the topic of football teams, you could just respectfully say 'I have to admit that I do not religiously follow football', and in most instances, the interviewer will understand. That being said, some common knowledge on the topic can be easily picked up and considering your SEC background, will definitely come in handy. If you have the right mindset, you don't need much to go on to create some banter and conversation during the interview. By doing so, you make an impression, and it relieves a bit of the stress/tension of the environment.\n\nHowever, it sounds like you have an issue with communication (at least right off the bat). Communicative skills are SUPER important for any interview and alone can be the difference between receiving an offer and being shown the door. I realise that it's difficult given the bullying, but the basic litmus test for 'normal' can be as simple as body language, tone and receptiveness to questions, all of which are observed during the interview.
When the enemy team has a lot of heroes that rely on physical sources of damage output (e.g. Axe, Wraith King). This however, hinges on the fact that you need to have a good early game to take full advantage of the evasion she offers, before the enemy team can afford MKBs. She also does great against squishy targets that don't have disable capabilities, such as Sniper or Silencer, due to her high damage output.\n\nPA is a bad pick where the enemy team has a lot of magical damage or spell/AOE abilities. These things don't miss, and so PA becomes as vulnerable as each and every other hero. Examples include Crystal Maiden and Lich.
The result of a society becoming too PC... they're too afraid to say anything too soon, even with overwhelming evidence.
Can you confirm as a graduate??\njkjk
This is nothing compared to the Clinton scandal. A secretary of state has access to much more sensitive and potentially damaging confidential documents than a mere governor. Not to mention that Clinton stubbornly and egregiously went AGAINST the counsel of the administration in using a private server.\n\nThis is a false equivalency. Conservatives vilified it because of its severity.
Efficiency. The skeletons that spawn are hardly worth the time for thr amount of gold they give. If they do get spawned in time, the player just kills them for the sake of clearing the camp so that it respawns when the minute ticks over.
I think Arkham was pretty fantastic tbh. They introduced a very mysterious yet intimidating antagonist, and I'm happy they managed to bring back another perfect iteration of the Joker. They had a healthy range of side missions, great open-world Gotham to explore (although it was mostly empty), and the plot was engaging.
Well for people (myself included) who tried their luck with NMS and were sorely disappointed, Elite definitely blew our minds. ED manages to keep the impressive scale of the galaxy without feeling the need to dumb down the complexity of everything, thereby keeping everything both enjoyable with a satisfying purpose.\n\nThat's my impression of the base game. And then Frontier comes along and says in their Patch 2.2: BUT WAIT, THERE'S MORE!
Rome 2's multiplayer is decently more popular due to the variety of the factions and the general flow of battle. Also, it fields a much more interesting time period and a better single player experience (imo).
I want a Lizardmen DLC :( Their roster and diversity is (imo) one of the most interesting.
This sub has gone to complete shit. For a sub called "politics", it loses out even to r/the_donald in terms of neutrality, and half of that subreddit is just memes.
Last i checked, you actually have to be found guilty of a known crime beyond reasonable doubt to commence inpeachment proceedings.\n\nSorry, but this looks desperate af. The left is really grasping at straws now!
Looks like a very respectable build
It works perfectly fine in the hands of a competent player who has good map awareness, but imo it's not playing to the hero's strengths.
Sorry, here it is: https://pcpartpicker.com/user/Coriolis95/saved/\n\nTotal wattage: 487W, according to pcpartpicker\n\nEdit: Hold up, I don't think the link is working. Trying to fix now.\n\nEdit(2): Should be fixed now.
In my experience, skywrath mage does extremely well against LC. She duels a team member of yours, and wham, you throw down your ulti on top of her and watch her melt. That is, provided, that you don't get dueled. Make sure you have some duel fodder/baiter on your team hahaha
Prime example of a match I just played: https://www.dotabuff.com/matches/2752813927\n\nLC on the other team jungle farms for about 10 minutes until she gets her shadow blade, proceeds to initiate by herself on full hp targets and simply falls too far behind to make a difference anymore.\n\nAlso, notice how she didn't even put a SINGLE POINT into Overwhelming Odds (Q) for the entirety of the match, despite being level 20 by the end of a 48 minute game.\n\nThis was at about 1.6-1.8k bracket, so it's a blessing when the enemy team first picks an LC; and spells instant defeat when someone on your team does it...
I mean in a legal context, to actually try to lock her up would definitely be unnecessary since she's already lost and doesn't really have anything going for her now. Talking about it is different.
Thanks man that clears a lot up <3\n\nUnfortunately, my GPU only takes DVI-D input and my new monitor only takes D-SUB input - probably didn't notice this since my old monitor took both types haha. Gonna have to whip out the old HDMI cable and give that a shot.\n\nMany thanks!
Going to Law school for the prospects of money or because you have 'nothing left to lose' would be a weak motivation to actually see the course through. You need a greater motivation to not drop out after first or second year when you get a real taste for Law.\n\nIf money is your main concern, there are a lot of other degrees out there that are in demand, and would be much less taxing on your schedule, your funds, time, and most importantly, your sanity.

If the game has gotten to the point where the lich has enough money to afford a skadi, I'd say your team is just getting stomped overall. He literally only has two tools available to him: a damaging slow with a long cooldown, and chain frost. If you manage to kite or even tank out those two and survive, he's as good as dead.\n \nThankfully, a lot of heroes specialise in this sort of quick, lethal initiation. Storm spirit, Ember spirit, QOP, Monkey King, and... Slark. Tbh, slark is probably the best of the available 'counters', but you can make do with the others.
you da real mvp m8
Its pretty hard to play against your own counter. Honestly, if I'm playing with a carry and have to deal with someone who counterpicked me, I would almost fall back into a semi-support role. You'll be relying heavily on your team to dispatch with him, and just accept that while you can't do too much against a SK, there are four other targets which you are effective against.\n\nIf you have already mopped up 4, make sure you bring dust or sentries to deal with him while he's in sandstorm.
Get a support of yours to throw down an observer ward on the Pudge's high ground during the rune fight. Then, you can position yourself behind the creep wave so that you're safe from his hooks.
If this bothers you, thankfully there's a mod to fix it :D\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=204682595&searchtext=pike\n\nThis mod makes it so that pikes are always visible on pikemen, even when their phalanx formation has not been activated.
Knowledge about individuals is really only necessary if you intend to keep an eye focused on one particular playstyle (e.g. If you are really interested in how Miracle plays Slark, or something).\n\nHowever, pro games are much more about teamwork, team compositions/synergies and communication, rather than banzai one-man-carries which most people think dota is. Some of my buddies and I occasionally attempt to replicate some of the tactics they use during the international, but fail horribly. And so, we're left with a sense of awe at professional player's precision and coordination. We get hyped for Internationals and Majors because we get to see how certain heroes are used effectively when there are competent team members to support them.
imo it doesn't have, say, as many individual features as NMS or Eve does, but each feature that it DOES have is a mile deep.\n\nSo it's quite easy to pick up the basics, but difficult to master. To list some off the top of my head, the trading economy is incredibly complex and fluid, meaning that trading oftentimes isn't as simple as shuttle X from A to B a million times. In terms of variety, you have rare (or undiscovered) trade routes to exploit, weapons smuggling, slave smuggling, drug smuggling, etc. The economy in each sector is impacted (even if in an insignificant way) by player contributions.\n\nActually flying your ship is like 95% of the game so it's also a good thing to address. To put it simply, you have control over pretty much every aspect of your ship. Everything from manual landing on centrifugal landing pads (although you can "cheat" by buying automated docking systems) to energy and module management during exploring and dogfighting.\n\nDo you need a bit of extra speed to close the gap to your target or additional agility in a dogfight? Dump all your energy into engines.\n\nDo you need your weapons to recharge faster so that your thermal cannons can fire more frequently in dogfights? Divert energy to weapons.\n\nAre you under heavy fire? Divert energy to systems for stronger shields.\n\nFrom a guy who played about 40 hours of Eve, it took me about 25 hours until I actually began to understand what I wanted to do in the game and how to do it.
Red.
Draft is half of the solution, but how you play your team comp and heroes is the other half of the solution.\n\nSplit push only when its safe to in order to force a tp and create space for your defending heroes. Preferrably push with heroes that are naturally evasive or hard to catch (Tinker, NP, Ember, AM).\n\nTeamfighting is tricky against heroes like Magnus, ES and Enigma, but their effect on the game can be minimised. Don't clump up, and use your team's strengths to dictate the fight. I like Silencer - he works like a charm against great teamfighters - practically renders them helpless long enough for your team to take them out.
Never go cold turkey... on anything. Moderation is key, even for the 'bad' things. Just remember that balance is inportant in any healthy lifestyle.
It's beginning to look more and more like league :(( Volvo pls
Take a break from Dota before you burn out for good. Dota will always be here, and the core mechanics are not going to change even if you take a year-long hiatus. I find that if I'm on a streak of 5 or more losses, i get maaadd tilted, and the effect just compounds. Take a break, and come back to the game with a level head. You'll play (and enjoy the game) much better with a level head.
Bottle > Phase Boots > Urn > Armlet > BKB > Basher\n\nOptional: Hand of Midas, Aghs\n\nAS SOON as you get your level 6, you want to begin roaming. NS is not a great laner and you're not doing any favours to your team by being caught out in lane. You should be the one catching other people out in their lanes. You have a reliable silence and a reliable slow, so great for hunting down weaker or isolated targets, similar to the playstyle of BS.
Probably just down for maintenance, or a hotfix or something. Seems to be pretty regular nowadays though :(
Capturing still images in Total War isnt what melts your PC. It's when your rig has to keep up with everything happening on-screen in real time. \n\nBut still, sweet screenshots!
I might be wrong on this one, but DLCs just increase the variety on multiplayer, so it shouldn't cause any compatibility issues in lobbies. So if you don't have a DLC that your opponent/friend has, you can still play with/against them, but they'll have access to factions and units that you won't.\n\nIn terms of which one to buy, it really depends on which title you're talking about. CA's track record with DLCs have been mostly hit-and-miss, with fantastic ones like FotS for Shogun II, and with less than stellar ones such as the Chaos race pack for Warhammer. Waiting for a sale is your best bet.\n\nIf your pc can't handle the most recent titles (say, Rome II and onwards), I would highly recommend Shogun II. Looks fantastic, extremely fun and interesting time period, great gameplay and it has some fantastic DLCs.
Pick Viper, pick up a PMS quickly, max corrosive skin passive and watch Sniper kill himself trying to harass you out of lane.
Rome II was absolutely horrid at launch, but even a few years down the track I find myself needing a Rome II fix every now and then.
Just a question... is there any reason not to do this? Does it increase operating temps? Does it reduce the lifespan of the RAM?
I had an issue like this when I recently upgraded the CPU + Motherboard in my rig. When I pressed the power button, the fans would twitch for half a second, but the PC simply wouldn't boot.\n\nTurns out I had missed a motherboard standoff screw, which had fallen behind the motherboard - in direct contact with the back of the motherboard.
CS:GO is stuck in what it thinks is the 'golden age' of shooters. No hard feelings to CS:GO lovers, but there are so many issue with that game that make it even more punishing to play than Planetside...
Just mute all chat and focus on yourself. It helps to keep you focused on winning YOUR game, instead of focusing on what your team is doing.
At early game (at least for me), the rune determines if I go to another lane for a gank or not. Haste, Invis or DD is usually the ones I want. If a Bounty or Regen appears I'll just return to laning for the next 2 mins.
Support who don't buy wards or help you farm up is just a reality of solo-queuing in pub-games. You should always be prepared compensate a little for where they don't perform.
SIEGES! They are and have always been a huge part of the Total War series and, imo, is what made Attila a standout for me. Huge cities with multiple layered defense... that's what I hope CA gets around to soon. It honestly feels criminally underdeveloped for TWW, and i wouldn't kind paying money for it if they fully fleshed out this aspect of the game.\n\nCA has the assets - the backdrops look completely stunning, but that's all they are... backdrops.
DAMN, what a streak.\nBut still, moar dakka needed
I've encountered about 3 or 4 in my 50 hours of gameplay, and it's always cool to look at the dark side of the planet and see the lights of populated cities. If landing on earth-like planets comes further down the track, well... the world may not see me for several months.
HRC is a bit of a Wall Street puppet... take a look at her recent campaign trail, the Clinton Foundation, etc.
Exactly, a scale. A SoS's actions have further reaching consequences than a governor's. Consequently they are assigned a different level of responsibility. As an individual who is handling classified and confidential national documents, you would be expected to exercise reasonable care when sending, receiving and handling these documents to ensure to the best of your ability that the confidentiality of these documents was not compromised.\n\nBut for the sake of argument, let's use a 1-for-1 comparison.\n\n1. Hillary used a private, personal unsecured server on which she sent and received classified information. Pence simply used a private email account. According to Indiana Law, officials are required to save documents related to official business so that they're retrievable on public record. A Pence spokesperson has confirmed that Pence complied with this law, but to be fair, we'll wait for third-party NEUTRAL sources to confirm or reject this statement. Either way, in comparison it seems extraordinarily difficult to retrieve documents from a privately controlled server for the purposes of federal investigation (Hillary's case here), wouldnt you agree?\n\n2. Pence turned over his emails and his email address. We know for a fact that Hillary destroyed multiple boxes of emails, the motive for which is still in dispute. Accident? Unlikely. Potentially spoliation of evidence which if true, is incredibly disgusting on her part as a figure who has spent her entire public life in politics and the public eye.\n\nI fairly concede that the act is bad, but there's no comparing these two. One of Mount Vesuvius, and the other is popping a pimple.\n\nShould he be disciplined in my opinion? Absolutely. But again, this is a disingenous false equivalency to conpare this event to Hillary's email scandal.
In 5years if we're still talking about this... http://giphy.com/gifs/week-media-person-RL0xU1daTlMoE\n\nCustomary '/s'.\n\nAnyway, I think it would be better to let NMS die a quiet death. It had its time in the spotlight, in which many people learnt a $60 lesson, but I think it would be healthier for the gaming community to just say 'oh yeah, that happened' instead of 'OMG WHAT A FKN FAILURE THAT GAME WAS'
Axe is great for making AM's early game a nightmare. Just get in among the creep wave and stand there/last hit. If the AM comes in to try to get some last hits, use beserker's call and he's gonna take a huge amount of spin damage. It'll force him back to regen, or even back to fount.\n\nClinkz is great for hunting down AM in the mid-game when he begins to jungle. Use an orchid to silence him and just lay into him until he goes down. He's fairly weak until he can farm up a skullbasher/manta.\n\nBasically, just restrict his farm so that he doesn't become a threat to YOUR carries. Hunt him down if you have to.
Sharpen those pitchforks - the Rule of Law isn't going to restore itself!
It's kind of like a cake. You have been advertised a cake. Sean Murray tells you everyday that you're going to be getting a cake, so naturally you pay for, and expect a cake.\n\nThen release day drops and you're handed two cups of flour and an egg. But you might say, "Well, all those items are good and edible, and they can be enjoyable". Well you're right - the core elements are there, but that's all that's there; just the bare minimum to make a cake. You know, none of that exquisite shit we were promised and led on to believe would be included. Not even any unique flavours.\n\nIn essence, NMS is just a hastily baked mess of sound (and pretty well executed imo) core elements, but it's a far cry from what was promised and what was advertised.\n\nNot to mention that you try to contact the cake company and they give you a big middle finger by going radio silent.
Not overpowered per se - there are just things that need to be toned down or adjusted. For example, Jingu Mastery scaling and his 300 attack range.
When 50% of the subreddit is just Trump memes, I think that's a sign not to take the discussion there too seriously. That said, there are some voices there from both sides who are quite knowledgeable.\n\nThe problem with /r/politics is that they take themselves 100% seriously. I can enjoy some good-spirited debate, but outright implying that all Republicans are 'morons' or 'idiots' for supporting Trump makes it hard to hold any conversation at all.
It's plugged into the D-SUB monitor port - the same port that I used for my previous monitor.\n\nI've done some looking around and dxdiag is showing integrated graphics as the preselected graphics, instead of my 390 which shows up in device manager. So I'm pretty sure my GPU isn't quite dead yet.\n\nHow do I get my computer to switch from integrated to my dedicated gpu? Sorry for the stupid questions.
It will forever be a reminder of the atrocity of pricing an unfinished, unpolished indie game at full AAA price. I personally hope that it goes on to remind people about the dangers of pre-ordering on the basis of empty promises by developers.\n\nNot to mention the abysmal PR choices made by Hello Games.
With only 50 hours in the game... most of which has been done trying to just make bank, I doubt I'm anywhere near even leaving inhabited space lol
This guy has been getting crushed in political debates recently. Some of his grand ideas that he had leading up to the primaries are being exposed as unfeasible or simply unrealistic. Even Ted Cruz floored this guy.\n\nAmerica just needa to work with what its been given, not what they dont have yet.
Carry, but not a hard carry. If you intend to win, you need to have a presence from the get-go, all the way up to the conclusion of the game. \n\nThe thing is, if you pick a support, your carries aren't going to carry, and you will lose fights. If you pick a hard carry, your team will not create the space you need to be effectively farmed up. Heroes like Kunkka or Alchemist tend to work well from my experiences. They are hardly reliant on the team at all, have great survivability, and are not heavily farm dependent.\n\nOn the other hand, a hard carry like a Drow or PA is effectively useless if they have a braindead team who can't help them to secure kills, or cannot create the space they need to farm late-game items.
Have a cheeky peek at the profiles of players on the enemy team. If one of them has a habit of spamming a particular hero, consider nominating it for banning during the banning phase.
I'm from Aus (Sydney), and yes, Briggs is full of salty vets. I pretty much play on Connery exclusively now because of a much healthier population. Trust me, play on Connery.\n\nSteam is a great way to get in touch with active members of friendly outfits, and is overall a great way to expand your PS2 social network. Joining groups on Steam is great and such.
Probably phase 2 of the construction system. There were rumors of more deployable structures on the way.
200k+ subscribers for a Dota2 player is not an insignificant stat lmao
Thanks! Both of you were right - I made a silly mistake because I was excited about my new monitor...
Cool that DC made the list 
How can you predict the contrary?
Herro dis shitty wok I taka ordur prease 
I hate to sound negative, but in my experience, solo-queue supporting at low mmr (sub-2k) is a huge risk that simply isn't worth taking...\n\nI hate it myself. For some reason, whenever I support there's always a core on my team that has some spastic item build, costs us the game, and then proceeds to flame and feed until we ultimately lose.\n\nIn a recent game where I (regrettably) went support in soloQ ranked, our Sven, who was our only real chance at winning late game, got himself a late perseverance at minute 12 with 10 minutes of freefarm, with me in lane zoning the enemy solo offlaner. I gave him the benefit of the doubt and said 'hey, maybe he's going for an early linkin's, given that the enemy team has a lot of spellcasters'. NOPE - at minute 25 he put it into a battlefury. At minute 29 we lost the game.\n\n*Anyway*, enough venting.\n\nMy **solution/advice** to you? Mute all chat, and play a core. F*** supporting at low mmr. Unless you have a friend who is willing to party rank with you, don't even touch supports.\n\nNow which core should you pick? You need one that scales well into the late game, but also doesn't need to be super farmed in order to have an impact early-mid game (looking at someone like anti-mage here).\n\nMy suggestion is slark. His only real core item is a shadow blade. He's very self sustaining, can solo roam/gank, and has absolutely no problem 1v1 manfighting almost any other hero in the game. \n\nAlso, muting chat helps both you and your team. It'll stop you tilting when you get flamed (or when your team flames eachother) and help you focus on your own game.\n\n**TL;DR** - Mute chat and focus on your own game. Pick a well-scaling core (my suggestion is Slark) and avoid supports like the plague.
If it's happened overnight, check your hardware. Make sure none of your components are dying, and none of them are overheating excessively (especially the CPU). CPU overheating has been known to cause slowdowns: https://support.steampowered.com/kb_article.php?ref=2715-YIPD-6873\n\nHow is your PC's airflow? Does it have sufficient cooling? Overheating for extended periods of time can cause permanent damage to a PC.
Cheers!
Casting it on an enemy slows them, and makes them take 2x primary attribute dmg + 75 magical dmg. This is great for drow, as she has HUGE agility gain in the mid-game.\n\nAlso good for escaping, as the Drow can cast it on herself and then tp out. Can't say much about morphling... haven't played with him too much yet.
If you tp back to fount, that's a 1 minute+ cooldown for tps, which means that the enemy is free to roam or gank your other lanes without worrying about a powerful support like CM or Dazzle rotating in and turning the fight around. \n\nIt's not so much about the XP or gold. It's more about the support presence. Just being there as a support while your carry farms up in lane is a great deterrent to any ballsy enemy heroes who might want to, for example, tower dive your carry to take him out of the fight.\n\nIf you're laning with a carry, you need to keep up the pressure on the enemy heroes in your lane, or you will inevitably lose the lane, which will make mid-late game a nightmare..
Wards are the most simple counter. The other thing that can work really well is to just have another support in the lane which can help you turn the fight if they initiate.\n\nOh yeah, and watching your picks are helpful. Easily gankable heroes such as sniper who have no reliable escape or mobility should be an obvious no-go if the other team has those three heroes.
Why is that exactly? Are you afraid of backlash?
...on a beach in the Bahamas. With all the moneys he made from just preorders he'll never have to work another day in his life.
What was the rationale behind limiting trade? :(
savage.
Adding to this, just make sure you draw the relevant links between facts and rules, and then come to a solid (but non-exhaustive) conclusion. After all, you are judt giving advice. For example:\n\nFact A indicates X.\nFact B indicates Y.\nFact C indicates Z.\n\nThe combination X, Y, and Z forms the basis of the atom bomb (or something).
Thank you so much for pointing that out before I made the mistake!\n\nI do plan to overclock down the line, so after a bit of browsing I might go for the Gigabyte Z170X-Gaming 3 Motherboard.\n\nWill definitely pick up some new DDR4 Memory as well. Thanks again!
I'm half surprised you didn't hit a pebble and flip upside down, like 90% of the cases where I pull a flash and try to drive it...
They've abandoned their HQ: http://www.gadgethelpline.com/no-mans-sky-devs-seemingly-abandon-office-after-game-flops/\n\nSo there's really no way to follow them up, chase them down or locate them in any way. It's certainly not a comforting sign that they're still 'working on the game' when they have 100% appeared to have jumped ship.
Never is my bet.  If he does communicate, it will be through another member of his indie team,  probs the sound design guy. I mean, HG has abandoned their studio office and have mysteriously vanished... odds are he doesn't really care anymore.\n\nThere's just no possible positive outcome if he does break his silence personally.
So my PC just magically booted. Yay?
Never go cold turkey... on anything. Moderation is key, even for the 'bad' things. Just remember that balance is inportant in any healthy lifestyle.
Based on the Democrats' reaction, definitely 8 years. Nobody in their right mind would share their disintegrating "values".
Astute point, but what if I start by purchasing one robot that can make money for me and then use those profits to buy more robots and then with the profits from my robot army I could buy land and then have my robots farm it for me. Boom done, now that's one helluva life 
Haha, I love the validation from your hostility and hate. You're on the wrong side these days. If this exchange isn't clear enough evidence that you should reevaluate the hate in your life then nothing is. 
I fully agree with you. Majority of people on here are the type of people that don't understand the sophistication of the game itself and how ideology shapes the way different clubs conduct themselves. They also mostly aren't real members of their clubs they are remote supporters who picked a superstar team and have never even been to the stadium and don't understand the inner workings of the club. Sure 'it's about winning trophies no matter what' to many of the people in comments here but those same people will argue against Trump saying that just because he won doesn't mean he's 'right'. But I mean, he won though? Does it matter how? In a soccer context- apparently to many of you *it does not.* Real Madrid is clearly a douche club winning many games with brute strength and quick counter attacks, but beyond that, they are also doing bullshit like threatening to leave la liga for a super league because they want more money and power. Barca are not saints either, but Real Madrid are one of the worst globally renowned clubs right now in my eyes. \n\nEdit: thanks guys for making me feel right about many of you. 
Harry Potter-ish 
Fair assessment. This was my first presidential election I could vote in and I haven't followed much until now so learning that these politicians behave so childishly at times is extremely frustrating. I don't condone that nonsense from either side, I've only seen one in action though. 
Link format =  [text here] *no space here* (link here) \n\n[Example Link](http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/psychology/images/a/a9/Example.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20071109091305) 
I was literally in the Gallery for the address. Any ordinary idiot such as myself could read the room and get a clear sense that there would be some serious clapping for Mrs. Owens. A decision to not continue clapping for her was obviously a conscientious and intentional response rather than an 'oops I sat down first and don't know we were still goin!'. Unfortunately electronics were not allowed inside or I would have personally taken my own photos of how unnecessarily disrespectful some people sitting on the left side of the aisle were. For many issues idgaf whether or not the democrats yell and boo or cough or whatever playground thing they are doing, but to my knowledge EVERYONE in there that was physically able stood and clapped for Mrs. Owens except for like three people and it was one of the most emotional moments that I have experienced in my life. Disrespecting Mrs. Owens to spite Trump was wrong and it should be viewed as such - regardless of the politics in the background. 
He demonstrated that the reporter was flustered in his opinion. He's proven that he's made those same motions to display a sense of dishevelment for years including to show his own feelings when he didn't have his phone or something. that's a made up narrative that trump mocked the guy about his disability 
This is sick
for some reason i just find this to be so r/mildyinteresting
the second that pence gets punished for this is the exact moment that Hillary will also become guilty...
I'm thinking we don't stop until trump is hanging in the streets which is what the fucking pig deserves. His grandkids should have to see him suffer and die 
Me and my also college age brother are going to be as enthusiastic as reasonably possible up there. I might wear a MAGA hat but I'm not positive that capital etiquette allows for that. 
And it looks like there's only one sub in the pile of food, which is bizarre 
I was linked to a video of Trump accusing Hillary of struggling to even make it to her car. I presume the commenter wanted me to think that it was bad for Trump to say that. However, I have seen the video Trump was referencing, the one where Hillary struggles to even make it to her car, and I wanted to share that not because Hillary is relevant, but because Trump was not wrong to say that she struggled to even make it to her car. \n\nYou're totally right in general though, Hillary is irrelevant these days.
I somehow have seats in the house gallery for the address, I'm so stoked and can't wait for it 
Alright 
I'm saying that you can't possibly be seeing the game the same way as I do because you don't. You don't think the same things in the shower and you don't think the same things while driving. Am I more of an elitist for telling you what you that we definitely do not think in the same manner about all things? I might have been rude but I don't think less of you as a person. You're probably in a much higher place in the social order of like than I am. I'll tell you now that I'm not the smartest guy around but I just get lost in the game and I'll give emotional responses when I'm being targeted for saying my opinions. 
Moms man. We love em but they can be pretty clueless at times. 
BOP IT 
I'm sure that you'll be ok either way *thumbs up*
Magic. Definitely emotional at times(tough to tell the actual mood in the broadcast). About halfway through it I began to wonder what I could watch live in person that would even top it and I'm left with USA in a World Cup final and the Launch of the first manned mission to mars.\n\np.s. It was like a middle school cafeteria on the left side of the aisle with bizarre schoolyard rudeness. Not sure if both sides have historically done that or whatever but from my perspective the left looked immature and unwilling to cooperate with Trump no matter what he does. 
This is clearly sunglasses commercial and I'm going to buy sunglasses right now
Phones weren't allowed inside the gallery, but I have my fancy ticket and I could maybe find myself on some clips of a recorded version when the cameras pan back 
he was just trying to enjoy the slightly roomier airplane seats which he strangely fought so hard for and the flight attendant was ruining his big moment
I might try to be a senator someday instead of becoming an entrepreneur. It just seems like people start throwing money at you and you don't really even need to hide it. Ah wait a sec I forgot that Trump is changing that. Sheeiit. 
Wait what? They aren't 100% undefeated? Whaaaaat? They lost a champions league game against psg? Obviously they suck ass. Ok but really, Yeah they have been in a rut, but that's natural. There are highs and lows in the game and I respect r. Madrid and Barca because they've accomplished amazing things, but Real Madrid has no appeal to me. I don't like the style of their club, the attitudes of some of their players, or the general vibe from the club at all. Real Madrid is pushing their own agenda on the game for their own personal benefit. I feel that Barcelona has always tried to produce beauty in their game for all to appreciate. You should read Dennis bergkamp's book actually, there are many interesting points that pertain to my opinion of the game. \n
I don't feel I'm an idiot. I think of myself as an optimist. CNN in particular is rooting for trump to fail. I don't like that. My opinion as an American matters as much as anyone else. Quit belittling people for their personal beliefs that don't hurt anyone else. 
Odds a story comes out about how this offended some kids parents who claimed that Melania is scary to their kids because she's married to Trump?
Do you think less of the reporter because he's disabled? He's a highly capable person and Trump is allowed to demonstrate that he seemed flustered. That's ok with me and that's ok with half the country at least. I don't care if the president mocks people. Obama mocked Donald Trump multiple times. 
Might need more proof, until then I'm calling r/karmaconspiracy 
I'm not an elitist and I don't even know how I could prove that to some douche on Reddit. \n\nAlso, soccer is subjective so there will be different opinions. We can both be right without being wrong. I appreciate different things than you. 
I got tickets to this from my representative by a total fluke. I am so excited to be happy and clap proudly for our President in the same room as many that want to see him fail and who also claim that he has no normal supporters. 
Like half an hour-ish long \n
I actually read on huffpo that this was a meeting that leaders of black colleges had no choice but to do because trump is a power crazed narcissist 
I was there, it was magic 
There's that human spirit that makes it exciting to be a part of this thing! 
The liberals were super, super staunch with their refusal to smile or give anything to Trump. It looked like Bernie wasn't even paying attention at times. It will take some meeting halfway if there will be any unity because it's not just Trump pushing them away on his own. \n\nEdit: and I say this because I was there in person. 
Haha, didn't even notice that! He is a great guy 
Been there off and on. Just focus on yourself. It's a tricky cycle where the more you think about it, the worse it is. You might also be hanging around douchebags. In any event, you could try to use your quietness as an advantage in a way that makes those around you value what you do have to contribute. \n\nI'll leave you with a loose quote that has been attributed to Abraham Lincoln: "better to remain silent and be thought a fool than to speak up and remove all doubt." \n\nLet others be the fools until you're more comfortable. 
I'll be watching live in person. Any shouting requests? 
Ahem..hello am I to late? Here I go anyway: αha 
You're right I did a knee jerk comment and I'm leaving it there just cause 
Can't wait for the state of the union address tonight. God bless president Trump 
Her and Ivanka were talking and it was all so authentic. 
Crazy story, surprisingly worth the read. Good stuff 
Just a joke. It does seem as though this particular situation could have been handled on more of an individual to individual basis. If I buy a couch and the person who sold it to me calls up and says, "hey weird question but can I come by and pick up the stash of ecstasy I left hidden in the couch?" I would more likely just tell them that it's already been thrown away as it was unknown to my family and then when Im done breaking that disappointing 'news' I'd go and dispose of it myself. Human to human, we didn't need to waste the time and money going after some idiot that forgets that they left weed in their sold couch. Life is probably tough enough for them as it is.
Glad I could reach someone who is reasonable. Don't know what's with all the hate from many others. They can agree or disagree but to resort to hate and insults is kind of petty. Oh well
Reading the comments on that article almost gave me aids 
congrats bro i'm happy for you that sounds like a great manager career
Good to know. It's not overly clear what they consider to be appropriate attire for a working office which is the only real language I could find. I can do Non-ragged!
When you run for president of the United States, it's fair game for opponents to criticize your inability to walk your body to a car and sit yourself down safely without assistance of a small army. That's not dishonorable, that's realistic. Trump supposedly mocking a disabled reporter has been debunked as well, check it out. 
She's irrelevant now. It would probably viewed as unnecessarily cruel for Trump to continue going after Hillary at this point.
lol I was 16 that year and 14 when Obama became the president. My age bracket, in my anecdotal experience, has lots of love for Trump. 
Fuuuuuuuuuuck. Tammy. 
You start on day one 
I actually have tickets to the house gallery tonight. I will be applauding loudly and proudly! 
No electronics/photography allowed in the gallery :( so it's a no go for the 10" tablet showing dangerous hate symbol 
We should have had a bigger meltdown!!! 
 I do totally mind the law. I hate the law. I think weed should be legalized. I was just sharing what I personally would do in this particular situation rather than bringing excess burden onto myself and the other person involved. Hell, if I had found weed in the couch I would have given it back to the person, but I stretched it to a point where the goods found in the couch would be dangerous enough for my sensibilities to decide they should be disposed of. I'm not aware of any unjust laws besides marijuana bullshit but I'm a pretty average person. 
An error occurred and I can't see the video 
I'm just mocking the people that call for Trumps head. 
preposterous at best, freakin retarded moron needs to be fired and publicly shamed for being an asshat at worst. 
Hahaha, SHAAAAAME. But Nah, I'm not a braindead zombie backwards minded liberal. I've been shamed at a rally in northern Virginia, I've been shamed when telling some people who I supported in the election. I've been shamed at the inauguration. I've seen first hand how hilariously ineffective that shaming nonsense is. Big reason I'm still here and proud to support Trump actually. Such a shame lol. 
I understand burden of proof, but a) this isn't a court of law and b) the original claim seemed like it was merely a rhetorical prediction. What leads you to believe that it wouldn't be a shit show with press targeting Trump for everything they can think of and even some things that Trump hasn't actually done. That's a reasonable assertion and unfortunately we cannot supply proof from the future. Luckily we can do this thing called 'speculating.' It adds a little bit of suspense and intrigue to our lives. 
lol wtf
Haha. You're sad man. Take your upvotes and enjoy them for being a general douchebag. This is the best you can do. You don't have important or complex enough thoughts to actually engage in the conversation so you resort to this? You're the least relevant contributor in the conversation- a non-contributor actually. 
*cant wait for Trump to address a joint session of congress in place of the state of the Union this year. 
She needs to be hung in the streets 
I'm being serious. Sorry if you don't appreciate the nuances of the game and opposing views on it don't make sense to you. You should read Dennis bergkamp's book "Stillness and speed." That will give you a better idea of how soccer is viewed by the most passionate players and coaches. 
The sad reality is that people want to show up for the destination party and don't know what the road from the start is really like. I'm with you, the road to success is important and there's often multiple ways a club can take with some being more admirable than others. 
He is a fascist and a Nazi if he wants to keep talking down on immigrants and what kind of moron considers 'of' a part of the acronym! /s
Haha, not much we can do at this point but appreciate the innocence. Maybe encourage staying away altogether before getting hooked? 
>I don't like him as a person\n\nOk, that's a bad start of forming a compelling argument\n\n>I don't even think\n\nTrue \n\n>here is a real DJT speech \n\n[You're right, it was real as fuck](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=9zYthqiLs_I)
Damn, this is the counter culture side now...
This is why my poor ass is buying a robot as soon as I can. 
I was there. It was awesome. The left side of the aisle looked like miserable school children for the most part. 
pure dried whore eggs in a rusty old can? That's sounds absolutely tasty 
Wow. Snipes caught lying...I'm sooo surprised. Wooow. 
Bigly if true 
I gotcha and I took it at face value, but the notion poor people are living in this gloomy world where they are more or less permanently trapped is just wrong. Yes, lots of people work hard their entire lives and never refine a skill, discover a passion, or figure out how to demonstrate their maximum potential/value. Their lack of self discovery and creative drive is what's hurting them and not a lack of excess capital. I don't have any ideas about how to fix that other than promoting a positive outlook even in times of financial distress. That's just my thought about the matter. We need more optimism in the world and if I was always told that no matter what I did there's a chance that I might never break out and create a comfortable life for myself, then I might not be where I am today. All because I very well may have thrown in the towel already and been happy to scrape by and never get to think about owning a robot of my own. Someone could work hard their entire life and never figure out a way to get their fair share. I could also die in a car crash later today. That's just life and nothing to be bitter and negative about! 
He rudest people in person were the man with the red question mark pin and the fat lady to his right. They were obnoxious assholes for the entire speech. I made long eye contact and shook my head in disapproval. It f e l t g o o d m a n 
I'm conservative and smoke hella weed. Generalizations go both ways brotha man.\n\nI think the appropriate to term to describe the couch buyer is "douchebag narc" 
'We have just received word that the tape on Trumps tie could have been put there by the KGB while Trump was having Russian prostitutes pee all over him on the same bed Obama would be staying on the week after!'
I just think that sharing an opinion of Hillary and talking negatively about her is one thing and actually dedicating resources, with presidential powers, to working on trying to lock Hillary up. Crowds chant "lock her up" but I think we'd actually find out that a vast majority of people don't really care about this email stuff 
I'd love to see a video taken inside the cab to capture the look on the drivers face 
Tradition is fine but I never realized how petty it all could seem. It felt like a high school cafeteria with two sides that are rivals.
He knocked it out of the park. The room was very emotional in person and it seemed like it was tough to capture the actual mood in the broadcast, which was still good. The place was packed and generally extremely supportive of Trump and particularly raucous in support of special guests that were in the the first lady's box. I guess it goes both ways but on the night the left side of the aisle looked really bad with their planned coughing nonsense and general rudeness and refusal to stand up for even some of the most reasonable points like fighting for American people to have a better chance at prosperity...
Poor people that aren't willing to work hard don't get to have things. I'm poor now but my poor ass is finishing school and getting a job at all costs. I'll get my robot, I just can't have it right now. 
What about this is corporate propaganda 
What is this, robot chicken?
The owner of McDonald's was a pretty shitty guy. He violated the founder's contract with him and threatened to make them bankrupt in court if they took action against him. According to the founders the owner agreed to pay them 1% in royalty fees in a verbal agreement, but he never actually paid up.\n\nHe made all his money by owning the land the McDonald's restaurants were on, while letting a franchisee come invest and pay for the building.
Phteven_j is the biggest faggot out of all the mods on /r/guns. \n\npestilence and Omnifox seem like decent guys who just dick around a little too much and accidentally hurt people, but they don't mean to. Phteven_j is just a dick.
Tell that to the Ocean people men. They were more likely to be killed since they were more likely to be fighting (and they all died to the saviors and not the women since they were the warriors).
Just going to chime in and say that if you haven't shot handguns, specifically the P320 before, then go do it before purchasing. I have a P320, a Glock 19, and a CZ-75, but I end up carrying the Glock since the P320 has a bulkier frame that is harder to conceal.\n\nIt sounds like you've done a lot of research, which is a good thing. I'd advise against making up your mind completely before shooting these guns, however.
> CS:GO is a sport who is decided by rounds, so you have to be better each round in order to win.\n\n> It doesn't matter if you have 10 rounds ahead or 1, you have to be better EVERY round.\n\nEach round isn't independent, as Economy and Psychological Advantage are gained by winning or losing previous rounds. This means that skill isn't the *only* deciding factor on who wins a CS game. When you are behind in rounds, you are also typically behind in money as money is gained more quickly by winning rounds. This results in teams who win more rounds having more total money available to spend over the course of a game, and therefore an advantage.

He's not a scientist. He's a popularizer of the work other scientists do. \n\nIf he were a scientist, he would be the one doing the work; instead, he got a kid's television show and now parades around talking about other people's work.\n\nedit: This isn't because I disagree with him ideologically. I agree with his stance on environmental policy. I believe in global warming and that humans are the majority contributor. \n\nLet's not delude ourselves into believing that every engineer who graduates from a good university is a scientist. Scientists are legitimate academic researchers who have become experts in their field by doing countless hours of experimental work and literature research. Just because Bill is an experienced engineer doesn't mean he is a scientist.\n\nedit 2: In case you don't believe me, here's an article from the IEEE (Institute for Electrical and Electronics Engineers), which is one of the biggest engineering research institutions on [why Engineering isn't Science](http://spectrum.ieee.org/at-work/tech-careers/engineering-is-not-science). Bill Nye is an engineer, not a scientist.
I have a 4790k now too, and I bet it will be relevant for at least another 4 years. I overclocked mine to 4.5Ghz on air with no problems (Cryorig R1 Ultimate) and the performance jump is pretty serious.
> They chose to report on things that fit their narrative, and nothing about the actual chaos going on in the Trump administration.\n\nThe thing is: there isn't that much actual chaos happening in the Trump administration. Other news agencies are spewing it out in an effort to make his administration seem worse than it really is. When things go bad, like they did recently with the Flynn leaks, Fox calls it out and say it's bad and also calls for an independent investigation.\n\nOther news agencies just make mountains out of mole hills.\n\nEdit: a word
Could you take that AWP and go mid, please? All I have is a rifle.
Never thought about it this way before haha. Makes sense, though.
Fox has a decent track record these days. Democrats lie to make things seem worse than they really are. Conservatives have on average been pretty happy with what has happened in Trump's administration, so they have no reason to lie.

I'm a huge LG fan, got a picture with the whole team back at Columbus. They played well, yes.\n\n99% of the time, when a pro team is up 15-7, the ones in the lead win. Liquid choked. It's really simple.
In Cologne that was definitely true. I went to MLG Columbus, and Liquid had significant lead. They choked on two important buy rounds and it cost them the game.\n\nLuminosity was my favorite team in that tournament. They played very well, better than Liquid who choked for sure. That doesn't mean that Liquid didn't make some bad mistakes though.
I'd also bet that lake is where they did the boat scene.

Answer me this then: why do many medical forms request gender and not sex, when clearly sex is what physicians need to know? edit: The reason why is that *sex and gender are the same thing*!\n\nThe left is pushing to say that Gender is fluid and each person can determine it. Next, they will say that Sex and Gender are the same thing.

lolwut?
Do we really need that on a map that is T sided in the first place?\n\nT's can many times hold mid xoor and have information about the number of people in B. I don't think T's need to be able to do better takes with more smokes, as it would just make the map unbalanced.
> Many scientists are engineers and many engineers are scientists.\n\nYes, but a corollary to that is that every engineer is not a scientist. The engineers who are scientists have PhDs and work in either academia or industry doing R&D (source am engineer doing PhD).\n\nBill Nye got his degree, worked in industry a few years, then got a television show. Now he appears on radio and talk shows explaining science concepts and advocating for policy. That means he isn't a scientist; he's a popularizer.\n\nedit: Honestly, I don't even consider myself a scientist. I work in computational modelling and control theory. I'm an engineer, not a scientist. The distinction is very important.
Agreed. \n\nMy point is simply that he isn't a qualified academic research expert. He got his bachelor's and went to industry and as such he is nowhere near the expert he claims to be.
> While obstructionism surely goes back much, much further than G.W., the recent GOP crop took it to an unprecedented level.\n\nThis is liberal propaganda that the democrats want people to believe so they can make republicans out to be "the bad guy." It simply isn't true and the degree of obstructionism is no more unprecedented than as it was done at any previous point in political history.\n\n> There's a difference between filibustering and mucking about with congressional rules, and torpedoing your own legislation to prevent it from being made into law by a president you swore to oppose.\n\nNot sure what you're referring to, as the only thing I can think of is the healthcare bill, which was in a completely different form than how democrats enacted Obamacare.\n\nI'm of the opinion that the only way we will be able to solve the problems we have in America today is to stop the divisiveness and start working together. I'm a moderate and I don't think we need to keep making the climate so polarized that both sides literally hate each other on a personal level. 
You're not applauding his death, you're applauding in remembrance of the sacrifice he gave and the hero he was. You're applauding to support her in her time of grief and to show that his death was not wasted.\n\nSeriously, how do you not understand this? He was a hero, and we applaud him for being a hero. It's that simple. Everything isn't politically motivated; grow up.
So quick to forget that it was democrat stone-walling in the late Bush and early Obama terms that drove the Republicans to be the same type of obstructionists. \n\n"It's nobody's fault except the GOP's! We did it first, but then they did it back, so we have to keep doing it now!"
They chose the name for *this exact* reason.
I addressed the argument. You just don't understand basic statistics even when I tried to politely explain it to you.
While they produce a great product, I've read a number of stories from people who worked there saying that long hours and overtime are required and that they hate the workplace.\n\nI wouldn't say they are the perfect gaming company unless they also have a very good workplace for their employees. 
I made the argument. You just straw-manned my entire post. Here's how you did it:\n\n1)\n> The Economy isn't the decisive factor, it helps you win the round but is doesn't win you the round straight away.\n\nI never said it gives you the round straight away. I said that winning more rounds and having more money gives one team an undeniable advantage. Because Liquid was up *so* much, they had an undeniable economic advantage that usually enables teams of similar skill levels in that position to win.\n\nYou implied I said it gives you the round straight away, but I didn't. What you did there is called a straw-man and is considered a logical fallacy. It's where you build up a false argument, pretending the other side said things they didn't, only to tear it down.\n\n2)\n> And if LG had more Psychological fortitude, how is that luck?\n\nI never *once* used the word luck in any of my posts. Since when were we talking about luck? Oh, we weren't. You just implied that I said that LG won by luck, which is the second straw-man fallacy you made.\n\n\n3)\n> You are just wrong about your definition of luck.\n\nAgain, another straw-man implying that I *ever* said that LG was lucky. LG played well, but in most circumstances a team with an advantage such as Liquid should have won. They didn't because they choked.\n\nYou can't make an argument using only straw-mans. You need to actually respond to my points, but you never did. You just invented false corollaries to all of my arguments in your head and proceeded to say I was wrong by tearing down your own fallacies. Please learn to think, man.
> don't you want to see him and his staff get their shit together, rather than fumbling the ball right out the gate?\n\nThey haven't fumbled the ball. They have already begun putting in place orders and legislature for nearly everything Trump said he would do. Most conservatives are pretty satisfied with what has already happened. \n\n> Losing two cabinet picks in one week is pretty chaotic. The Pres and VP not being on the same page about what could be a huge security risk is also chaotic. The President not realizing he put Bannon on the NSC, Conway and Spicer not being on the same page... etc., etc.\n\nSure, there have been a couple of blunders. What we have see, though, are ***results***. That's what matters to Trump and his team, and it's what's important to Trump supporters as well.\n\nThere are always going to be growing pains, especially with a team with little to no political experience; however, biased news networks have propagandized you into believing that those tiny blunders are a much bigger issue than they really are. They haven't gotten in the way of results yet, and I have a feeling they won't in the future.

I'm not tainting our image, and this isn't because I disagree with him ideologically. I agree with his stance on environmental policy. I believe in global warming and that humans are the majority contributor. \n\nLet's not delude ourselves into believing that every engineer who graduates from a good university is a scientist. Scientists are legitimate academic researchers who have become experts in their field by doing countless hours of experimental work and literature research. Just because Bill is an experienced engineer doesn't mean he is a scientist. 
I've read that many developers don't enjoy working there because of long hours and mandatory overtime. They've made many great games, but they do need to look out for the best for their employees as well, as none of this is possible without them.
I paid $650 for my FDE one, and I love the way it looks; however, the only real difference between the two is the pistol grip (hogue rubber on FDE), and for such a price difference it isn't worth it.
This was also the reason why I bought a CZ-75. Too bad it isn't full auto like in the game.
That I can agree with too.\n\nI just get frustrated when all of the 90s kids (my age group) believe every word Bill Nye says because they remember his show so fondly. I loved his show. Now that I'm an adult (and an engineer doing my PhD), I listen to him with a bit more skepticism.
Sure there's a slight difference in how you hold then gun, but OP's point is that functionally it is the same thing as a fully automatic.\n\nThe reason the ATF isn't going after all the bump fire stocks now is that they are sick and tired of chasing down every little thing and want the laws to change.
I just got a 980ti and did the same thing.\n\nSweetFX is pretty nice, and there's also an HD Texture Rework that adds quality to buldings, roofs, etc.\n\nI also really like the turbo lighting rework mod, as well as water quality enhancements.
The rubber bands on the gun also help to reduce recoil because of their elasticity.

It's not empty, it's symbolic for the country's support of relatives of these heroes. \n\nIt means a lot for a grieving person to be able to understand that their loved one was a hero who, while they did not deserve to die, did it for a reason that benefits us all. It helps people come to terms with their emotions and helps resolve their difficulties.
This needs to be a story somewhere.
I doubt the health stats will be accurate as many people will be buying sodas from other states to avoid the tax.
Seriously! I completely agree with you. \n\nIt's bad enough that he parades around like an expert, but it's worse when everybody else who watched his show also believes that he's a scientist. News check: he's not!
> You're saying health stats would be fudged by people cheating on their diets. Which is mind-boggling.\n\nNo, I'm saying that since I highly doubt the state tracks soda sales from out of state customers you can't know the correlation between the obesity rate change, or lack thereof, and soda consumption in the state since you don't know if people are actually not buying soda.\n\nTo do correlative statistics, you have to have a dependent and an independent variable. If you can't be sure your independent variable is unaltered, then you can't do correlation analysis. It's basic statistics, man.
Either they are lying, or they are literally that stupid. It's really hard to tell nowadays.
I never said anything bad against Luminosity.\n\nLiquid messed up. Period. LG, being a good team, took advantage of it and won. Why do you think I said anything bad about LG? Can you read?
> Care to provide some examples?\n\nI took a Civil War History course in college, and during our discussion of the reconstruction I remember that we specifically talked about how historically Andrew Johnson was president during the most obstructionist congress. Lincoln had absorbed many powers into the executive branch that were typically congressional so that he could more effectively fight the war, and many congressman wanted these powers back afterwards. In addition, after the Civil War Johnson was also a proponent of a number of policies that would have radically changed southern life, and so many southern democrats pushed back and fought with tooth and nail every tiny piece of legislation Johnson tried to enact, many times using the same obstructionist policies we see today. Johnson almost got impeached, avoiding it by a single vote, after he tried to use power that Lincoln had taken control of during the war to remove the Secretary of Defense. \n\nedited to have a [link](http://www.impeach-andrewjohnson.com/08OvertObstructionOfCongress/OvertObstructionOfCongress.htm) and a [better link](https://www.minnpost.com/eric-black-ink/2011/11/why-president-andrew-johnson-was-impeached-and-why-we-should-care-today)\n\nIf anything, the conclusion I draw from this is that the obstructionism we see in congress is a reflection of how our nation is deeply divided politically and socially.\n\n> http://talkingpointsmemo.com/dc/mcconnell-filibusters-his-own-bill-to-lift-debt-ceiling\n\nMcConnell is an idiot, and as a Kentuckian I'm depressed to say that McConnell was the only choice we had. He is not typical of republicans in general, but many are forced to listen to him as he is Majority Leader. \n\n> I agree, but nobody has any idea how to do that.\n\nIt's really depressing that people take politics so personally. So many news stations polarize the discussion by making it a one-sided, emotionally-charged moral choice. It just isn't healthy. \n\n*(Warning, different topic completely)*\n\nIt also doesn't help that we have so many educated idiots who learned nothing from college in their women's and gender studies courses. If you graduate college and can't do a basic statistical analysis, I think there is a problem. General Education requirements nowadays focus on sociology and culture rather than on quantitative reasoning. As a result we are producing people with qualifications but no real reasoning ability.
I had the same issue when I did my first appleseed. They put some tape around the left lens of my glasses, and my accuracy went from 0 to 95 in a single shot.\n\nI've since learned to focus more with my right eye through practice. You'll get it soon, just keep practicing. You can always do dry-fire practice (warning: if your gun can handle it) safely to cheaply practice.
Double post sorry

At MLG Columbus Liquid was up big time, but they choked and it cost them the game against Luminosity.
Yeah, doesn't show anything there. Guess he deleted it to cover his tracks. Pretty standard move for an asshole I guess.

I have a 4790k and a 980ti, and it should definnitely be sufficient for at least another 2 years. I play at 1080p 144Hz, and the 980ti is more than capable.\n\nA 1080 is not a huge jump up from a 980ti, if you're going to upgrade you should get a 1080ti when they drop.

Sure, but when you make as much money as CDPR did, you can afford to hire more engineers to reduce the total workload. For a starting game dev company, your statement is true. When business is booming, expanding your workforce can actually increase productivity.
Engineers aren't scientists. That's why we call them engineers.\n\nedit: Scientists do high-level theoretical problem solving. Engineers use this information to invent real-world solutions. They are two totally different things.
Probably on a reservation.
They make missions for the maps, and they also do some map optimizing before they just release ones from the market. \n\nLast operation, they even made a ton of custom co-op missions for everybody to play.

That's all liberals do these days - play semantics to persuade people dishonestly.
But that's because there is more surface area in the chamber of the larger caliber round, right? It's not because of how hot the rounds are, it's about the pure size difference.
> People of any skin color can be offended at whatever they want.\n\nThe problem is that people are offended at innocuous things that were never meant to be harmful in the first place. In determining if something is hurtful, you have to look at two things: a) what's said and b) the person who said its intention. People forget that motivations and intentions should matter more in determining if something should be hurtful, and instead only use what was said.
It is Liquid's fault. When you are up by as much of a lead in a major tournament and let the other team come back, you have nobody to blame but yourself.\n\nWe are talking about professional teams, not some MM game. Pro teams should not fail so miserably as to allow another team to make such a massive comeback.

They Hydro infrastructure was originally gutted under his first term (back in the day). This affected maintenance of dams as well as construction of new dams/reservoirs. Even the Levees that were built in the early/mid 20th century are getting old and are in desperate need of repair. But Brown caved in to the Green demands and ensure are long term hydro sustainability went to shit. And he was around to face the consequences for his shitty ass policies. Unfortunately in both the drought and this dam failure he has managed to skirt blame by the useful idiots in this state. He blamed "Climate Change" and told people "this is the ways it's going to be"; meanwhile blowing tax payer money on useless rails and padding the pockets of public unions.\n\nHe has done nothing to address hydro infrastructure and all this shit is going to continue to get worse.
Because let's face it, at the end of the day, he knows the Feds will step in to do *one* of these things if he didn't. The people in Washington won't build him a bullet train, but they will spend to save people who are jeopardized by a leaky dam. So unless we're all content to let a California town wash away to prove a point, the governor wins that game of chicken (though obviously he takes a public opinion hit over it).

Republican politicians for the most part have as much decency as Democrats, however Republicans never fight back because they are scared to be labeled something by the media. Hopefully with Trumps lead they will learn to fight back and not take this stuff anymore 
Obama can do no wrong and any attempt to discredit him is racist, obviously. 
I think you're probably right but that's not the question he was asked. 
It's pretty bs to monitor someone's campaign and to be listening in on their strategy and whatnot.
If the wiretapping order came from Obama he should be imprisoned. This is how dictatorships work.
I love how we have a Republican president who is happy to fight back. He's mocking them as that's all the democrats deserve right now.
Yup fucking unbelievable. Of course the media is hardly talking about it. Obama is a scumbag 
Who has heard anyone IRL even mention this garbage? The elites are inadvertently revealing how disconnected they are.

And Eric Holder over "fast and furious", the IRS leadership over politically motivated targeting of conservative groups, the hopefully on-going investigation of the Clinton Foundation, the warrantless Obama-era surveillance of Trump and his campaign and transition team and subsequent leaking of classified information.               \n\nIt's also directly in the public interest to find out what and when Obama knew about these activities and whether he himself committed illegal activity.                      \n\nThe gloves are already off on one side so it's time to reciprocate.          
This is the same nonsense as the liberal liars are trying to pin on Trump.  And as sad as it sounds it really is time for Trump to start bashing back with that exact same nonsense.  Have Spicer do a pressor with their concerns over russians and pelosi, schumer, and the rest of the liars.  Republican politicians were never smart enough, because of basic decency, to fight back against the left.  Trump hopefully knows better.  And I would also have DOJ looking into soros, schumer, and pelosi regarding real laws that they might have violated.  If you don't crush the left they will just keep coming back with more lies.
6+ weeks old: https://mobile.nytimes.com/2017/01/19/us/politics/trump-russia-associates-investigation.html\n\n(Sorry first post and don't know if nyt is allowed)
I agree.  Trump was willing to back off on going after obama and the rest of the criminals in his regime.  Time to bring them to justice for real offenses and maybe the nonsense will finally stop.
Fucking obama bugged Trump tower and Trump's office/home, it came out today.\n\nYou are damned fucking right this is a witch hunt. We'd have known long ago if there was shit.
It's like EVERY FUCKING LIBERAL is forgetting Obama, thinking he wasn't on air, saying "After the election, I'll have more flexibility."
What is happening in this picture is even more concerning and I think democrats are somewhat projecting at this point. If you remember the McCain Feingold act McCain was grilled as to what evidence he has that politicians are corrupted by influences especially monetary. He said it happens but he cannot name names. I do not always think McCain was like he is now and wanted some sort of direction in this country to end corruption and influence in politics however I feel he has been sucked in to far at this point. I think democrats at this point are projecting about the Russians and I would not be surprised if democrats are in cahoots with the Russians. If there was something on Trump with Russian involvement it would have come forward by now as there are only two political options that Russia could use with the information\n\n1. The Russians use information to blackmail Trump into favoritism etc\n2. The Russians who have been trying to de-stablize America since the great war release all the know about Trump, the entire presidency and cabinet picks fall out, it leaves a power vacuum and we are at civil war\n\n\nThis makes me think that democrats are in cahoots or have been in cahoots with the Russians in the old adage of pointing fingers to take away blame. I say this as top level democrats have been marxist idealists all their lives and have had some sort of sympathy for those who suffered from McCarthyism. Hell Bernie Sander had a soviet flag on his desk, visited satellite countries of the soviet union, honeymooned in moscow and still hangs a portrait of a bolshevik in his senate chambers. In this picture Senator Schumer who is hyper critical of Russia at this point is chuckling it up with a former KGB agent and now President. At this point I am starting to believe the democrats are puppets for the Russians as they are just projecting way to much onto this administration. So now if shit hits the fan and it comes out that the democrats are into some dirty dirty treasonous shit there will be a handful of democrats that believe it is false because it will be viewed in democrats eyes as retaliatory without any credibility causing them to defend their representatives at all costs
Celebitchy downward trend into craziness is one of my favorite things to ponder. \n\nWhat exactly are these "writers" doing all day that they have a leg to stand on calling somehow lazy. I could be totally off and they could be spending their days serving soup to the poor. But they write up a few blog posts and moderate comments, that's their job, it's not exactly something back breaking. Good for them for having an easy job but it doesn't exactly give them a lot of credibility when calling others lazy. \n\nThey say William is never around and the kids barely know him but when you see videos Prince George actually turns to him and seems to be comfortable with him. How do you get a toddler to fake body language? \n
It's like when I blow money at Target and console myself by saying I'm actually driving the American economy 
This is I would say about 90% on your brother, he is choosing to allow his partner to harass and torment his sister.  To put it blunt Amy has a stick up her ass and at this point she is too far gone to back down. The fact your brother has allowed this to go on is pretty telling of his character as well. Are your sisters and mom going to go NC w/her? You may have to press charges. \n\nI have a best friend like you that is family, her and I have even talked about how we feel more permanent w/each other than we do w/our husband. I get it, she's family and its non-negotiable, we have been best friends for over 30 years. \n\nWe too have accidentally giggled at a casket. We were standing up there and the lady was kind of green and the we were like what if it shoots up, then it just goes and we start cracking up. \n\nI think sexual orientation has little to do with this. If Georgie was straight she would accuse her of trying to fuck your brother. You may need just say Amy fuck off next time you start your shit I'm calling the cops. 
He doesn't talk to you for weeks?  Move out now before you expose a 2nd kid to this behavior. He is an asshole, that's the simplest way to put it.  Your son will treat women like he treats you if you stay 
That's funny about the grandparents. I feel like some people are so absurd with their boundaries, "Uh No you will not be buying my daughter a dress to wear this summer, she is my child and I will choose her attire 365 days a year, you boundary stomping narcissistic old lady." 
Gd Eugene I have a 5 year old little girl who cries less. 
She's in soccer and gymnastics and she loves them both. She won't talk to any teammates that she doesn't already go to school with.  \n\nShe's been to cheerleading camp, swimming lessons, and dance. She likes all of the above except dance. She just won't talk to any of the people or kids she doesn't know. 
Even if biomom was a hooker, crack head, or a nympho it doesn't matter, biomom is a hero in my book. Can you imagine how hard it is to give a baby up for adoption?  How devastating that would be?  Even if biomom didn't give 2 fucks she still did something selfless. She gave your baby the best possible shot at life, how can anyone fault that? \n\nTell MIL that biomom is a cancer researcher that is right on the verge of a huge break through and didn't want the baby to feel neglected by the long hours she spends in the lab. She can tell her friends that. 
I read that too 
It's Texas, there is very little bullshit in Texas 
So she can be your maid and dog walker? I think what she is doing in the house has monetary value. 
I think it would ease a lot of tensions if you treated her like anyone else. I know it's weird but it may make it less weird. 
Aww thank you. That made my day! 
Right. How long does an Instagram post take? I think anyone can spare 30 seconds 
He's trying to end this with you kindly. It's not a miscommunication, he's telling you that he wants out. I'm sorry, I know it's hard but you can't love enough for 2 people. 
Ya the only thing that is easy to destroy and get away with is emails. All of these fuckers are so dirty 
See how it goes for about a month just be cool and see how it goes 
Because Bush plays the role he has been assigned. He's the bumbling idiot President that may have made some bad choices but is really a good guy. He's like Bill Clinton who comes across as likable and you forget he's a sexual predator. 
I feel like everyone is missing the point here. If this was a man who went to work everyday then went to say bowling one night a week everyone would say so what he needs some down time. \n\nPlease reread the post and imagine the gender roles reversed 
If you had sex last night there is no pregnancy. You would be preventing the egg meeting the sperm and then creating a pregnancy. \n\n\nIt's frightening that teenagers think this is an abortion pill. 
Don't forget that poor Charles is having his grandkids poisoned against him by the Middletons. Prince Charles and Camilla are hard working saints who are sickened by the lazy duo. 
Ya I think she thinks they are getting tons of shots, pelvic exams, and aren't wearing clothes. 
It's a shame that you are willing to throw out a good relationship for this but do what u have to do. Btw if he is a great guy ang this is his only "flaw" someone ends is going to snap him up 
Sounds like Anne needs to pop a couple of xanax and chill the fuck out 
Because they can't always play The Departed or Rambo 
I think she may be misinformed. I'm not crazy about the idea of abortions but if you are preventing a pregnancy that's the same as birth control. 
I swear boys and girls come in groups. When my daughter was born everyone was having in girls. Her class is made up of all girls except 3 boys. 
Amy must have a golden snatch. That's what me and my friend call women who have guys totally oblivious to their behavior 
Bets on Jenna trying to have her kids deported if she thought she could?  
Please figure out a way to get out this and in a few years if you both have pulled yourself together then maybe u have a chance 
The whole post was written with the purpose of discussing Kate flashing her bits. The echo chamber shows up as expected and discusses how little Kate does, rinse and repeat 
That just makes it seem like getting away is an even better idea. This isn't your responsibility even if you feel like it is. What if you get pregnant, would you bring a kid into this? Please just go. 
Filthy casuals
Did I read her parents live in a mobile home? Or is this GOMI fanfic?  I think it might be pretty cramped with all of them in one place 
She hides in the bedroom when your kid comes over and you thought getting her pregnant was a good idea?  Pretty soon your kid don't be allowed over. How sad for your daughter that she will see this new family where she isn't welcome. Honestly your friends don't matter that much, I can't believe you would let someone treat your child this way. 
If I was Eugene I would stay there on easy street 
He's probably kind of full of shit. It's a life lesson, happens to all of us 
You keep asking for ways to fix this and you cant. You aren't even responding when people suggest you should break up. Yes your feelings are more important, yes its wrong to tell her she is attractive.  Here is the kicker, he cares more about her feelings than yours, no you can't change it. You can stop bringing it up or you can break up,  there isn't anyway to fix this \n
Eugene is the Cliff Clavin of the apocalypse 
Exactly this....and Santa, the Easter Bunny, and the Tooth Fairy are real in my house.  My 5 year daughter loves it. 
She is 2 ....she is 2.  She has only been alive for a very short time so everything she does is new. Your gf has never had to discipline her because disciplining an infant is not something you really do. She has had her whole world turned upside down and you expect her to act rationally. Take some parenting classes or pick up a basic book, it will explain you can't expect the same responses out of a 2 year old as you would an adult. \n\n I'm glad you both are pro spanking, give yourselves a good paddling tonight. 
Eugene is like George Constanza pretending to be a marine biologist. He is going to have to pull the golf ball out of the whale blow hole. 
He didn't kill Daryl, he killed Glenn to punish Daryl, that's how it works 
I love how everyone smoked back then. I remember people smoking in the mall, it never occurred to me then that those clothes probably smelled terrible. 
It's not fair but you don't rat out your brother. Who is she to judge how people live? She even admits she did it out if jealousy. I hope her family finds out and ostracizes her. 
That would be awesome 
Is anyone going to watch this?  This is the age of TV, movies are dead. Walking Dead tonight 
Closed Captioning is your friend 
Wait what? She claims to be a size 6? Like now? Are these photos recent in a size 6?  Do people believe her?
Biting a dick? 
I have a couple thoughts on this. Ok so back in the day everyone smoked everywhere and people lived.  \n\nBut at the same time it's disgusting and causes allergies and all kinds of things. Even if your husband says he won't smoke anymore you married a smoker, this is going to be a struggle. I hate the thought of your babies clothes smelling like smoke. Smoke has a way of getting into everything. 
This is so sad to read, your poor son. You are going to be lucky if he ever speaks to you again when he is grown. 
She can basically do no wrong w/me, I will always see her as Hermione Granger. Yes, I know she isn't the real Hermione.
You should feel guilty. It's not like they were human traffickers  or stealing from a little old lady. Stay in another country, what you did was terrible. 
To be fair shes crazy af and probably has no clue who these people are. 
My MIL does that shit so I thought your MIL was probably lying too.
Thanks! You are right about sending her up to do things. I'm just going to tell her since she is so big now she can go do it. She loves the idea of being "big". Always where'd you get that red hair always all the time! 
If you tell her friends you will have a whole new pack of enemies. They won't believe you 
I have the same countertop 
Don't have kids anytime soon with anyone. You two should break up, she wants a more traditional family and you don't. If u don't have a problem with yourself why should you go to counseling? 
Everyone is allowed some mistakes in life. Just chalk it up to lessons learned and get out now before you bring a kid into it 
Rick decided now was a good time to take Michone on a romantic weekend away? 
*hold my beer* 
I'm right there with you living in Texas and wondered the same thing 
These are great ideas. I'm going to have her start ordering her food for sure. 
Wasn't the book Hermione was in the restricted section? 
That's a great idea. She has a puppet stage and puppets maybe we could do this with those. 
No it means he is an asshole and you did right by blocking him. 
I don't have notifications for anything other than texts.  
Ok the first indicator that they will lie is when they kept making a point of how the grandparents won't be coming. They knew they were coming. \n\nThey are lying because they know that GMIL is a crazy lady. But she's non-negotiable so they are going to lie and make it seem like she is perfectly nice and the fact you have a problem with her is on you. Creating this false reality makes sure they are never uncomfortable about the way she behaves. 
You still aren't listening. 
Eugene please stop being such a pussy 
I don't think u should stop responding. You have told him when you are available and he didn't give much of an answer?  So I would say he needs to suggest the next date but I don't think you should stop responding. 
As weird as these people are and all the code/symbolism they are in to that prominent ring probably means something 
I have a couple of tubes of icing in my fridge. It's perfect if you just need a little hit, just grab a tube a shoot a little in your mouth. Perfection 
This is weird I basically cooked this an hour ago. I got a recipe on Pinterest. The recipe called for red pepper flakes and the sauce was half and half with mozzarella. It was pretty tasty 
Do you feel undocumented workers are criminals should people call ICE on them? 
I agree with u. I had to put that out there in a way that wouldn't trigger people to start screaming racism blah blah 
Ya I mean everywhere was smoked in at some point. People use to smoke everywhere. I don't like smelling smoke or having it on me but I try to consider that people lived thru it before. 
My daughter is 5 and she wants her done badly. We told her this summer so she can have them all healed up before kindergarten. I waited until she started asking before I even considered it. 
Porn is only a problem when he would rather watch porn than have a real woman.  Maybe he could try some therapy, right now porn is the forbidden fruit and you are the mommy.  Someone else could be able to get this thru to him. 
Ok I'm doing this. Can y'all remind me what the password is when I forget it. 
Ben says,"wake me dude when I'm confirmed."
They are mostly full of shit. My kid licked a piece of lettuce I made her try, can I say she eats salads now?  Seriously most kids are vegetarians unless its shaped as a nugget. I shouldn't even say vegetarian but more like continental breakfast eaters, fruits, baked goods, cereal, and juices. 
She resents her kids and treats them like shit but it ok because the patriarchal society has made moms think they have to be nice to them, she is evolved past that. She always thinks the next new thing will make her happy. She takes shitty blurry pics and has an obsession with film as if it makes her pics any better. 
I will look online today. She mentioned something about that yesterday when we bought some cookies 
She isn't as smart as you claim, if she was she would know when to shut up. 
Get the hell out of this. He is an asshole. 
At 2 she isn't going to connect "not listening" with getting a spanking. She doesn't even really know how to listen. If spanking really worked every kid would be getting their butt spanked all day everyday and no it didn't use to work. Kids were wild at 2 in every generation. 
This isn't the 1950's, your parents are very very controlling. This is coming from someone who is pretty strict on her daughter. I don't think you should tell them until you move out. It sounds to me they are unhinged. 
As a gift. Tell her you see she is into looking professional and u wanted to gift her a personal shopper and some clothes because you are so proud of her 
I know!  Smoking is gross 
That explains a lot. 
If you want to marry her then meet up with her. She is wanting marriage and probably a family, if you can't give her that leave the poor girl alond
Eugene got the penthouse 
You are exactly right you and him are family now. His mother and siblings come after you not just morally but legally too. 
I had my daughter via IVF 5 years ago. My in laws have no clue, we didn't figure it was anyone else's business. My mother in law thinks IVF is what women use to trick men into getting them pregnant. She thinks women go to the doctor and ask to be impregnated. She has no clue, I'm assuming she thinks the dads aren't the real dad?  I'm tempted when she says something about this, "well then how does your IVF granddaughter look exactly your son/her dad?"  I think my mother in law isn't being vicious, just ignorant to the process, btw she has a masters degree in counseling 
Why don't they rent the house out for a couple of years to avoid the capital gain taxes? 
31 and cheating on her 3rd husband. For fucks sake she is the common denominator in these failed marriages. I guarantee you that you aren't her only one. \n\nDude this is such a bad idea!! 
More like force his way to Brooklyn where he can dominate the rest of the season to help fuck over Boston
Yeah you guys have been through so much shit too. It'll all be worth it in a few years 
Draft picks are pretty irrelevant at this point. They're gone and there's nothing we can do about that. But what they've done is went out and got a very liked and well talked about GM & Coach duo that gives the fans something to look forward to. Our new additions roster wise this offseason were all high character vets brought in to teach the young guys (a majority of our roster) how to succeed in the league. Mixing the vets with the new staff has me so damn excited you don't even know. But... it's the Nets so who knows lol \n\nedit: irrelevant might not be the right word. i coulda said moot maybe. i realize if we do suck (i don't think we'll be as awful as everyone assumes) Boston could get better again but whatever. I don't care about them because LeBron. 
Yeah what the hell? 
Where do I sign up my twitter skills are my most valuable asset 
He's too much of a headache for front offices to deal with essentially. Or at least from what I've read. I'm not sure if he's still playing ball or not 
Smh lol 
Lmao you right. Completely misread that this morning 
Selflessly* :) 
Hate is a strong word but I definitely apply it towards Draymond Green, if that helps any. 
Hates a strong word but the overexposure and dominance of the warriors makes me... Not root for them 
Here to confirm 
That's so Nets lol. I have a completely different trust in this new brass though. Really like what Marks has done so far and the future looks bright
I never knew what stat meant until someone pointed it out... I pretend it doesn't stand for anything because that's an awesome nickname 
Atkinson coach of the year, Jeremy Lin MVP, Sean Marks executive of the year 
Rather spend big on young guys with potential than the skeletons of pierce Garnett terry crash etc lol. 
Sean Marks killin it baby. \n\n
I mean obviously signing marks was big since he's a popsciple (pop + disciple, not popsicle) but even smaller moves have been thought out and its definitely a new feeling as a nets fan to have actual thinking going into decisions rather than just money. The Atkinson hire has ties with the Spurs through pop & bud. A few smaller moves inside the organization have further convinced me that we are no longer just throwing money around but rather being smart and putting considerable amounts of thought into our decisions. Marks seems to really want to bring a winning tradition in. \n\nSorry for the paragraph lol. Didn't necessarily mean we are going to be the Spurs rather the moves we've made with ties to the Spurs organization has me excited and hopeful. 
crickets 
Lol I held hope we could turn Jordan Williams into something more than a big body down the road.... Yikes 
LOL
I'm not happy with you right now just so you know 
Suspected gay 
Your opinion is wrong bro please learn 
Pls we need this lol
:(
I'll accept your apology and like 90% of your fanbases but there's certain users in this thread that take every chance to shit on us they can. I'm kidding I don't really mind much anymore. It's gotten slightly better since the draft but it used to be impossible to post without being shit on lol 
Just follow and turn on notifications for woj and players tribune 
Thanks Skip Bayless 
Idk why people are going crazy over ads. Quite honestly do I really give a fuck that Curry has a Taco Bell logo on his jersey when he drains a 35 footer or LeBrons Jersey has a golden arch on it when he's slamming one home? Nope. Seems like a silly thing to get up in arms about 
What in the actual fuck
Wow... I like this 
No, that couldn't be! 
RIP to an absolute legend. 2016 continues to be the worst. 
Best advice I've ever seen 
And I'd respectfully ask you what kind of drugs you're on and to please pass them 
They need to do a better job promoting this series. I had no idea they were doing the cavs this year. With a little more promotion this series could be much bigger
Today is absolutely dragginggggggggggg. I need to get the hell out of work and start my weekend. Got some money to waste at the casino. Anywho playoff basketball is fast approaching and I'm sooooo ready. This season has kinda been dragging for me probably due to a mixture of the nets absolutely blowing and the dubs just dominating everyone lol. Back to work good day friends 
But what if I wanted otter facts
I'd like to be assistant to the executive VP of linebacker relations
I understand the joke in reference but enjoy this gif \n\nhttp://assets.sbnation.com/assets/2542201/lop3z.gif\n
miss u dray :'( 
It's forever. Lighten up, everyone knows the lyrics to that song 
I'd just like to point out that you all suck. Our lives have been a living hell and the moment things start looking slightly up yall remind us we suck. that's life though 
Just a tad
The man said unfortunately don't interrupt him!!!
You should understand it as a Chargers fan lol
Please waste my time I'm curious now lol  \n\nEdit: meh
So you haven't watched melo this season
[@twsnyderman\n](https://twitter.com/TWSnyderman)\nI tweet a lot and they're mostly trash but at least I'm trying
Oh my... Rex isn't suitable for top dog but he's one hell of a defensive mind. Would absolutely welcome that!
It was a need exit though. If we went into Brooklyn and weren't relevant enough to make the playoffs it would take even longer to gather NY support locally. At least the first couple years we had playoff games. Now we're transitioning into an actual growing period with the proper structure and staff in place for future success. 
If I ever need to be reminded about our draft pick situation though I can easily just start posting again 
Just go to JJ's page and look at his likes. \n\nEdit: nevermind guess he unliked it. https://twitter.com/NBAOnDefPen/status/748888623878201345
I'm not. It's a new system and with a player like him it'll take a little longer to get adjusted. The hitch is still there and they'll have to work on that consistently but his speed and athleticism still looks the same. He just looks outta place offensively and hasn't had much of a defensive presence either but he'll come around. Once our offensive system is at its full potential I hope to see lots of cuts to the basket from RHJ with the occasional midrange/3 point shot
Thank you for this
This is getting intense
Nets offer sheet to Tyler Johnson: $5,628,000 + $5,881,260 + $18,858,765 + $19,631,975 = $50,000,000 total. \nhttps://t.co/5LQJNW1OIi\n\nEdit: on mobile with no idea what I'm doing but the source for that is @albertrandom1 
I'm a loser that spends my days tweeting away. Don't be like me. 
I got a full time job that pays decent enough to where I am not entirely against getting up every morning 
Kawhi's accolades already... Hell yeah. Dudes an absolute freak
Basically what proky did when we signed ak47. 15 mill under the table and his family lives 
Gee, did LeBron shit in your cereal after unfollowing you on twitter today???
So strong I fell for it 
These guys have people criticizing their every moves once their in the spotlight. I somehow doubt they care about old high school pictures lol 
You're welcome. He's going to shine down there because he's a good shooter who won't have to create for himself. I don't understand why people have to shit on us any chance they get but I am excited to watch bojan and now Jennings on your squad
Need that remind me bot to come back in 3 years 
The second photo is a picture of JJ's likes on twitter. It's his page but you'll see Tweets, Media, and Likes on his profile. The guy that screenshotted was on his likes column showing all JJ's likes. \n\nIf that makes any sense. If not maybe someone else is better with words 
Yeah last thing I'm doing is thanking him immediately. Gotta let me get my anger and hot takes off then come back tomorrow to thank him for all he did 
I tweeted him saying salt and JJ redick favd the tweet lol
You cannot make an argument for him being GOAT 
Leave us alone guy. It's March and we just hit double digit wins. NBA is on watch for next year
Valid points. I can see where you're coming from. Personally I really don't mind so I should just stay quiet and let whatever happens happen. I was just very surprised at the uproar this morning. Between twitter and Reddit the reactions were crazy 
Why are you so hostile lmao 
My heart dropped reading that. Damn man, far too young. RIP
By 500k a year lol. 
Yeah I see a lot of people trashing him for doing this right before reinstatement but I'm just glad the dudes taking steps to getting the help he needs. It's never easy and just because he did it now and not a year or two ago doesn't make his decision better or worse. Just hope he can get it together because he's too good. 
Chad Pennington had some great play action fakes. Remember one specifically against Miami one year where he hid the ball so damn well
Same
Ryno should have never been traded away smh Brook needs his comic con buddy back 
I'm so jealous. I hope RHJ turns into a kawhi lite of some sort in the near future since we're trying to emulate you guys now lol 
I don't even comment anymore lol. 
Welcome to San Diego heal up and try again next year :(\n\nSmh I'm an east coast fan so I always watch the jets and was excited to see him with Phil. Luckily we still have Gates and Hunter Henry who the coaching staff loves. This still sucks but time for Henry to handle a bigger load 
Man, I'm sad. Stay strong OKC fans 
Trust me, nobody ever forgets to say Fuck Boston. With that said, fuck Boston
Some of my favorite moments in basketball came from those terrible squads. Something about being so awful that makes any little victory that much sweeter lol. Man Marshon used to be that dude. Sucks he couldn't play defense. Deshawn Stevenson who would play his heart out defensively and hit a few 3's every now and then. Could probably sit here all day just talking about those squads smh lol. 
Completely agree. It feels great knowing our staff has all our guys bought in already. They go out there every night and compete and play for each other. It feels completely different and honestly I'm still sort of adjusting lol. \n\nAlso just last night a few plays near the basket Lopez went up strong!!!! Has Atkinson finally convinced him to be the beast that he can be down low? Lopez also hitting 3s makes him so damn valuable. Example: Drummond had to spend his time on defense chasing Brook around... Sometimes on the block, sometimes outside for 3. He just forces the defense to completely readjust and it definitely threw Drummond off his game.\n\nV excited. Love this staff and this team. Go Nets! 
Grapes man, grapes. 
Water you doing windhorst 
Like I give a fuck LeBron is wearing a Taco Bell ad on his jersey as he's dunking on idiots lol 
I'm sorry but I'm over here dying at this whole exchange. Dude's ready to fight you hahaha
Oooh la la 
https://twitter.com/NBAOnDefPen/status/748888623878201345\n\nLmao JJ said he accidentally liked it 
Do you by any chance plan to buy a 1440p or 4K monitor?
I will make a wild speculation. Some game engines took code (even binanary blobs) straight from your competitor. I don't expect an answer of course.
Yeah. I know I'm in the minority but I need a 8core because I run scientific applications that are ridiculously parallel. Now I'm on my old Pentium  but I desperately need to upgrade. And I don't want to pay a fortune.
Motherboard bios...
"Intel has struck the balance between efficiency and performance. This proven platform delivers the best **gaming** experience. If you want multithreaded performance our 6900K is the best proven option at a premium price."\n\nExpect many comments like this ^
If Scorpio had Zen then all bets would be off...
The Good-bad thing about those guys is that they assimilate fast. My fathers cousins ,that are Americans, don't speak Greek at all.
Lock Obama the traitor up.
I'd give the i7 to my brother and get the ryzen
Many are shills. 
I agree. I expected that clock for clock ryzen would lag 10% at most.
Call him and tell him that you are not voting if he does not do something for restoring democracy in your land. Obama was giving taxpayer money to his brownshirts. 
NO. If it was delayed then developers do not have an incentive to optimize for ryzen. Way too many applications are very poorly optimized for ryzen. Because nobody gave a shit about ryzen and because in order to optimize you have to have ... a ryzen cpu. There are many applications that in their nature they are ridicously parallel. And they are complete failures when run with Ryzen CPUs. Ryzen on Linux was a disaster. Literally nothing looks the way it should be. Some apps are running better on fucking bulldozer than on ryzen!!! 
The game engine just broke. It doesn't know what to do. Disabling SMT will probably help quite a lot in these games.
Because 98% on r/AMD only plays games on their PCs. The rest of us have to endure them.
Don't forget about optimizations. Those games were compiled with compilers that didn't even know ryzen existed. Hopefully AMD can help a little bit and we might see patches that considerably increase performance for zen cpus.
Or bench your application for 10 minutes. 
Lisa will say a lot of fuck my life. Her company finally created an awesome CPU will 10x less resources compared to intel and half of r/amd is depressed because they thought an octacore could surpass intel's quads...
Low overclocks are due to Samsung/GloFo 14nm process. Hopefully the process improves in the following months.
WTF.
#TELOMERASE
Bernie still has a chance (in another galaxy far far away from here).
Why on earth would a 1800x be able to match 7700K? If the games use only 4 cores it's over. No matter how many more cores you add there will be no benefit, you just waste power. \n\nDon't forget that in contrast to many other applications games are optimized for the intel core architecture. That's it. AMD can do NOTHING about this. They cannot just copy the i7 architecture. Hopefully compilers will start to "love" zen architecture and provide a 10-20% boost in the near future.
Parents that give hormones to their children should be prosecuted and their children should be taken.
Yes off course they are cpu optimised. From the youtube videos it is obvious that Ryzen CPUs are underutilized.
Obviously you have to use a throwaway 50 dollar phone for this type of communication. But this is hard for old people to grasp
It should be zeroed for a few years. Too much over regulation.
This. They should provide their testing data and all results in raw format so that we can more easily find the outliers.
Great OC results. Hopefully you could provide us with some benches.
Now that is important! Hopefully more manufactures will. ECC support should have been standard for years.
Microsoft would want more testing with commercial products. It seems that there were differences between ES and final product. Motherboard manufacturer had ES samples for years maybe but last minute changes fucked things up.
Of course. Not only that. They also get free healthcare. In contrast to the natives.
The numbers in hashing were unreal. Does AMD include any instructions for ~~sha1~~ *sha2 family* hashing. This is extremely important for servers that use TLS!
Do you plan to buy a 1800X and pair it with a GTX 1080 / Vega and play on 1080p? Congrats, you are in the 1% of people who would do that. 
Obviously games for some reason do not seem to be optimized for the zen architecture. Is it windows fault? Is it compiler's fault? When can we expect patches from developers that bring performance to where it is supposed to be.\n\nP.S. I am not a gamer. Gonna order 1700 when it becomes available again!
Well its a small country.
Peace through strength.
It was released on February 30!
5g will be up to the task. And I'm certain that developing nations will get great deals. I'm not so hopeful about developed nations.
Dah. Only MTF trans are allowed.
I totally agree.
We will have more data this week as more people get the chips. 1700 seems to be the chip to get if you value your money.
Yes. Backdoored by Obama's CIA and NSA. 
It is a serious comparison for sites that are specifically targeted at overclockers. But sites like arstechnica shouldn't use oc CPUs and I don't think they did.

Damn
Yeah. I should have written sha2 family like sha256 which is the most widely used hash. I saw on a CPUz slide that ryzen supports sha instructions but I haven't verified it otherwise.\n\nhttp://segmentnext.com/2017/03/02/amd-ryzen-7-1700x-review/
That speed is fine for ... 480p.
Soon we will see FineWine^TM in AMD CPUs. 
Removing Trump might lead to civil war. Stay strong 'pedes
Hopefully someone who got the CPU will bench apache,nginx, php, nodejs, .net, (x)SQL, openssl
I'll search for bugs. Things that AMD should have taken care off but didn't have the time. I expect that there will be a few minor ones. Since I desperately need a 8core chip my main interest will be 1700 overclock ability. If it manages to hit 4.0 on a cheap board I will buy that. Otherwise I will buy the 1700x.
There is truth to that. They are also anti-semites.
AMD fucked big time if this is true.
Nothing lasts forever. Greek speaking people used to rule half the western world. Now, those of us that survived countless genocides from islamists, are commiting suicide by allowing limitless immigration. We are doomed. I'm afraid in a few decades we will totally collapse.
Oh. I remember early 2000s. Bought a DVD burner. Brand new. Was reading but not writing. Searched everything on the internet. Nothing. Before RMAing it I updaded it's firmware which was not supposed to fix the issue. Reboot system and burner works flawlessly. Another time, system extremely unstable. Update BIOS. Everything working flawlessly. BIOS and firmware , at least in the past, were really big issues.
Don't feed the troll
In Greece the Golden Dawn was imprisoned. Literally all the party members that were in the parliament including it's president were arrested and imprisoned in the same place we put terrorists. I was telling everybody that in all probability all those accusations are fake and it was a hitjob by the establishment. Now most members have left prison. Nobody has apologized. \n\nP.S. I am not a Golden Dawn supporter
Fresh install?
AMD will hype their product. That is their job. Zen is created for servers. How AMD hypes it doesn't matter. 1800x would never destroy 7700K at 1080p. If it did AMD would have released benchmarks like they did with cinebench.
Serious question. Do old people know of secure apps like Signal ?
At least in those countries everyone knows the state is watching you and you are always careful. 
I think only is parent company is traded.
Please post the link!
Stack overflow should release an offline app!
Oh. I'm not saying do it now. All software that had sha1 hardwired should have been prepared for this day. Hopefully everyone will learn their lessons. Never lock your application/module/library to a single cryptographic algorithm. Especially if speed is not a limiting factor.
Agree. I will have to go to watch his Intel videos for comparison but that guy really really didn't want his audience to buy the 1800x.
We will get there. But not now. GTAV was released when Ryzen was in blueprint stage. No compiler optimizations, it most probably uses code from Intel. If you see videos in youtube from serious reviewers you can see that Ryzen is severely underutilized. This will change but it requires the cooperation of developers. AMD had limited influence on developers in the past because nobody bought their CPUs. Hopefully this changes today.
Trump is trying to modernize America's nuclear arsenal. That's what Putin wants!!!
It would never be.
We await benches and overclocking!
Are there any apache,openssl,mariadb,php benches? 
That is true. And it is a tough situation for AMD. 
Shariablue
That is good news. I pray that they will also show older bioses
They are coming before the end of the month December
This is good news. Buy now that it's cheap!
Not exactly the same. I am talking about code that Intel just gave to the game engine developers. Not code that was optimized by the game engine developers themselves\n
Alternative facts.
We have the renewable people!
There was a post somewhere that all AsRock boards will support ECC.
Are you using win10?
Is GCC compiled with ryzen optimizations. Now that I think of it, do they use GCC to compile GCC?
To the top!
The good news for and is that they will test everything when r5 arrives
Windows scheduler most probably sucks big time. 
Workflow: don't know some shit, Google it, find the accepted answer on stack overflow, doesn't work because it's from 2010, Google again, find more recent answer, works, clear brain memory.
7700K is better for gaming than 6900K!!!! OMG then why does it cost 200% less!!!!! DX11 gamez are all that materz to all people.!!!
Wiretapping political opponents should never be allowed. Thanks to the fucking terrorists that the previous presidents imported you have the worst privacy laws. \n\nThe problem for Obama and his friends is that Trump will use these powers against them.
Some x99 motherboards cost more than the 1700. Let that sink in.
It really starts to make sense. So Obama used his friends in fake news media to create bullshit stories so he could have an excuse to wiretap. And r/redacted will defend them. 
Totally agree. I'm really really surprised that people thought that Ryzen could compete in gaming. The reasons are \n\n* Optimizations were exclusive for Intel CPUs since developers write code for existing architectures \n* Optimized for 4 cores. HT or SMT provide little to no benefit \n* Much higher clocks for Intel CPUs\n\nFinally the rest of us that need raw processing power have a $330 3.9 Ghz 8core CPU. 
Thanks for your time. We are hopeful that we will see you again here for R5 , R3 and Vega releases.
Nobody knows. I don't trust anything. I suspect buggy BIOSes.
And that was how the trans community handled the issue. Then a minority of them wanted the fucking president to issue a "fatwah" that they can go to whichever bathroom they choose. When you push on the society,  the society sometimes pushes back.
You are correct. At vsync your GPU just tries to do it's best all the time, even if your CPU cannot cope with it.
Deus vult 
I thought this was common knowledge. 
I had a friend in high school show me a book on the inconvenient truth that predicted half of Florida would be underwater by 2015.    
How do you do, fellow conservative? As open minded intellectuals can't we all agree on [leftist talking point]? Ignore my /r/politics post history I am one of you and that's why you should agree with me. 
Same with sports. Black people aren't better at sports it's just institutionalized racial oppression against whites that keeps them out of the NBA and NFL proportionally. \n\nALL RACES AND GENDERS ARE EQUALLY CAPABLE AND SUGGESTING  OTHERWISE IS RACIST. /s\n\nand if you identify as a bird you can fly. 
We don't need help, our nation is already prosperous and they are coming to take a slice for themselves. 
The good news is highly blocked subs totally get removed from r/popular and aren't just arbitrarily chosen by the admins based on what they want to censor. 
I find a lot of emotional projection onto animals happens because we apply human personality to some of their behaviors and grow empathy for them. 
Can you provide a source to where he expressed support for gay conversion therapy? Because he didn't and it's yet another fake news story that people want to believe.         
One thing the US has going for it is that our Muslim population is relatively low thanks to the Atlantic Ocean. I expect that to change in the coming decades if the progressive left has its way. \n\nEurope is finished. Give it a generation or two but they will be chanting for tolerance right until the moment they are beheaded. 
Imagine if miyazaki wrote a movie and shinkai animated it. Idk who would be better at producing/directing but it the weak link of shinkai movies is the story and ghibli's animation style is nice but aged a bit. 
That's his whole shtick. Class warfare and telling young people that he will give them free stuff. 
Really gets my noodle cooking
It's only far worse because the US has been trying to overthrow him... \n\nThe nation would be at its most stable and secular if he was left alone.   But no, we just had to push for another extremist Muslim shithole  and instead we get a civil war because Russia isn't going to let this one fall. 
Only a leftist could believe that laws shouldn't apply to illegals but constitutional rights should. 
The biggest flaw of libertarianism is liberalism. You can't have personal liberty with a nanny state. Otherwise innocent people end up paying for others' poor choices. \n\nEither we outlaw it or make it so people need to be responsible for themselves.  
 It's a good show. Blame SpongeBob for setting the foundation of modern cartoons and blame adventure time for making cartoon network execs think they can profit off the same formula of cheap animation and le random spaghetti arm humor. \n\nTTG is good though, ifyou got over your anger for the style change you'd be pretty happy with what they were able to make out of a shitty situation. \n\nI agree with you about it in principle but TTG is a symptom not a cause. It's success will only show that nostalgia draws a wider audience and they might bring back actually good old shows which is better than more new shows using the new formula. \n       
The Mexican government was (and still is) predominantly Spaniard aka European aka white. \n\nThe entire reason Mexico lost the land was trying to get American farmers to act as a buffer between Mexico and the Indians out in the wild west. So if anything, white Mexico was the one making a border based on race and underestimated the American tendency to declare independence.   
It not like these people were going to have families anyway. \n\nThat's why the Democratic party has been outsourcing their voter base. 
Anything written into law by an executive order can be written out of law by an executive order. 
I'm waiting for the dust to settle because both the media and Reddit will jump at every opportunity to crucify trump. \n\nIm not worried about  trump being held accountable because his feet are held to the fire every single day regardless of what he does or doesn't do. \n\nConsidering all the lies that were spread during the election I am not going to blindly accept everything the media says until the truth comes out. If they had been more reasonable with him in the past i would take these things more seriously but I've gone numb to them long ago. \n\nWorst case scenario he lied which is unfortunate but not unusual for a president, the last president has been caught on his lies all the time, the only difference is the MSM didn't go on a witch hunt and the lefties working in the Fed didn't abuse their position to take him down.\n \nSo I'm about done with the double standards of the left. They play dirty politics in every way they can and never let up. While conservatives are expected to be good sports and get hosed every single time. Unless they oust trump as a KGB operative, fuck em and fuck the concern trolls shitting up this subreddit.   
If by best they mean most difficult for the biased media to disect and smear. \n\nSounded like a pretty standard speech to me. My favorite part was when he said international trade exploitation was so common that American companies take it for granted, and Trump said something like "not anymore".  \n\n
Especially not the ones who were created solely for that purpose.  
What's the multi line flair.  Fuck zoid ty?
Source? Only evidence I've seen from the media is that he's a nationalist who happens to be white, which was twisted into "white nationalist"  on unfounded rumors that he was antisemitic, and then further twisted into "white supremacist" with the same mindset and lack of evidence. \n\nI have seen no evidence of him being anything other than an open nationalist, which isn't inherently bad, and then the rumors of him being antisemitic don't have any standing especially since half of his staff at Breitbart are Jewish. \n\nI would also like evidence for the claims that Breitbart is fake news that I keep seeing thrown around. While they are very far right leaning I haven't seen any evidence that their reporting is significantly worse in quality than CNN, MSNBC, or FOX, and many newspapers that also consistently mislead to push a narrative or report on stories with no credibility.   \n\nOn second though I think I'll take my questions to /r/changemyview 
I find that most of the negative news on trump is fake news on the merits of how far they'll go to twist everything he does into a negative story. And then go one step further and try to incite outrage. \n\nEven something like the  temporary terrorist ban, while you could disagree with it on ideological grounds, is grossly misrepresented to stir up a sense of impending doom among the uninformed masses. It doesn't help that professional protesters are becoming more commonplace to the point that you can't tell if a protest is manufactured or genuine because someone like soros is funding dozens of activist groups with hundreds of people.        
These protests were staged. The Mexican people have much bigger problems than trump. The ones who should be more considerate are those who enter the country legally and then demand they be allowed to stay. 
Didn't you hear? We're supposed to oppose trump no matter what. 
The crowd is so obnoxious. Cheer what liberal guest says, boo what conservative guest says. It's bad enough Milo is outnumbered 3-4 to 1.\n\nAre the people that watch these shows  so stupid that they need a crowd to tell them what to think? This is worse than canned laughter on sitcoms. 
I had the exact same experience. Originally disgusted by its lazy style and new format... I was at least happy they got the original voice actors. That little dose of nostalgia was enough for me to tolerate it as background noise and then I realized the humor was actually hilarious and had a change of heart. \n 
According to this website our president is a Russian spy who will no doubt nuke Russia.   
I usually hear drums late at night coming from the woods between the Welcome center and the frat houses. The beat is slow like a drum circle from some hippies or an undiscovered Indian tribe  
That's some autism right there. 
I'm skeptical. 
This is one of the guys that argued trump's immigration ban was illegal. Even though it's well within the Presidents power to do so.   
I predict Bernie will instantly go for the moral high ground and then CNN will zoom in on Cruz's reaction to the appeal to emotion as the crowd cheers for Bernie's feel good response to emphasize how unlikable and slimy Cruz must be to put facts over feelings. \n\nCruz will try to explain that Bernies view is too idealistic and Bernie will snap back with a stern voice saying something to the effect of "I dunno about you, senatuh Cruz, but I care about thuh needs of thuh people". The crowd, stocked with college students, goes wild.        
Last week they tried to collectively tear down Bannon. This week they're going after Kellyanne. \n\nThey've realized trump won't back down from attacks so they're trying to find chinks in his administrations armor. \n
>wtf I hate big government now\n\nThis is what liberals actually believe.    
http://i.imgur.com/lfI7o52.jpg\n\nI found a similar looking stray kitten recently. Can anyone identify? Id guess it's 4-6 months and it weighs a little over 4lbs but is very underweight even though you can't tell with the fur. 
Looking forward to the professional protest and  smear campaign failure from corporations  that will lose their asses when they can't exploit the laws anymore. 
Is Gintama really that good? 
I'm an amd fanboy if anything but Intel has had objectively better cpu architecture for the last few years. Raising clock speeds or stacking cores just isn't the same as quality architecture. \n\nIm certainly intrigued by the hype but not pumped because I'm skeptical until we know it objectively blows Intel out of the water. 
But their anchor baby kids will be able to vote and no doubt they will keep his party in power indefinitely. 
Yeah well if I was in charge I'd end poverty by making everyone millionaires. And the second thing I would do is fix all the other problems.    
Can you imagine the shitstorm of the roles were reversed. 
I'm surprised they're not on board with him, honestly. 
This pun came to mind as soon as Hannity started calling her "fake pocahontas". 
Oh. That's a shame.
If you compare the percentage of black women in the industry to the amount of awards given, it would only be fair to compare the percentage of industry vs the percentage of population. \n\nHint: black people are over represented in the music industry 
I wouldn't call that sub balanced so much as more civil. The discussion is still going to be dominated by left leaning opinions but that's due to the demographics of the sub more than anything else. What's most important is that even those with an unpopular opinion aren't ridiculed and shunned and so far I'd say the sub is a breath of fresh air compared to the hostility of most of Reddit. 
I think it's natural. Who goes to school for journalism these days? Liberals. If they're not liberals, their liberal professors will teach them liberalism. \n\nI believe conservatively minded people are more likely to aim high, play the hand they're dealt to their best benefit. And liberals are more likely to reject the system, study something they have a talent or a hobby for. Take their ball home and play a game they like even if winning isn't rewarding. \n\nIn a lot of neutral industries you're seeing extremely far left journalists shoveling their ideological garbage. They're not there because they represent the industry they report on, they're there because they couldn't find a job elsewhere. \n\nThe worst part is that journalists aren't special,they didn't achieve anything spectacular compared to the average person. They're probably paid a 30 grand salary and yet they're given this very powerful soapbox to spread their own ideas.         
Nothing about you reflects conservative principles. Yet here you are, shilling your /r/politics principles.   
wtf I hate trump and buckets of water now
She couldn't handle the number 4 
Half a dozen brand new anti-trump subreddits are forced to the front page and you think t_d is the one that is manipulating the system? t_d was the byproduct of 4chan breaking the Reddit echo chamber and the admins made sure that won't happen again but gladly allow anti trump subs to spam the new front page. \n\nMeanwhile there are organizations that openly admit to astroturfing in favor of a leftwing agenda.  
You can get Samsung Galaxy s6-s7 ear buds on Amazon for like 7 bucks. Sound quality isn't quite as good as Apple ear pods but they're way more comfortable and the microphone is top notch.  
As they should. But I also think Japan should be allowed to have a military again.
Referees are not without bias and neither is the ACLU. The biggest difference is that the ACLU can choose to interpret the constitution a certain way, and most of the rules in a football game are based on specific and objective.  \n\nHow can the Supreme Court be so constantly divided if they are effectively the Referees of the country? 
Not quite. It was Newt Gingrich's fiscally conservative Congress that balanced the budget and had a surplus for a few yeaes. It's a shame that Democrats give themselves all the credit for it and then use it as a talking point to push fiscally liberal policy.    
Both are correct in the context of his title. Google has bias in that they redefine words to fit their narrative. And they are biased for doing so. \n\nBut in your defense he probably did mean to use biased. 
This is very true. The media hasn't learned one bit from their mistakes. If they are constantly crying wolf for nothing, most people will stop listening. As for those who can't think critically and don't question what they're told, they will believe the world is ending and become hysterical like the many protesters and rioters we've seen.    
Trump called CNN fake news at white house press conference. They can't control that feed. 
It's just like the bidenbro subreddit. The guy who made it saw his subreddit hit the front page artificially then the people flocked. \n\nThe thing is, the guy who made it was a low key trump supporter and well I haven't seen that subreddit hit the front page since he confessed.
Chicago or not, it's pretty disgusting to see a public entity openly engaging in political attacks and then sending those political attacks directly to the parents and then sending kids home so the parents have to acknowledge their rant. \n\nThis is what grade a big government propaganda looks like and they use taxpayer dollars as a vehicle to tell you they deserve more taxpayer dollars. 
Same happened to me after seeing the constant smearing from the media the second he won the primary. An unusual forbidden fruit effect that lead me to hear him out and try and find what makes him dangerous to them. If they hate him this much to try and destroy him so blatantly, he must be a real threat to their power structure.  
So what happens if you self identify as someone who believes only two genders? Or a greater being that knows 2 genders to be true. \n\nLike the Greek deity hermaphroditus was a feminine boy who represented both genders (only two)  but there was no question he was a boy. \n\nI guess the problem is if you play their game they then realize if they superficially accept your make believe identity then you'll have to accept theirs. 
The Fox News report wasn't debunked at all nor is Trump "admitting" anything. He's clarified what he was referring to because the media took his vague statement and ran with it, mocking him for their own arbitrary assumptions. This thread's title is fake news and 90% of this subreddit is eating it up.
And to do so she had to take performance enhancing drugs
Trump distracted from his promises? The man delivered a third of his campaign promises in his first week in office and he's just now starting to form his cabinet. \n\nMany of his tweets are about moving forward with his promises or mentioning that the dems are doing everything within their very limited power to stop him from fulfilling his promises. \n\nMeanwhile I see videos daily of him meeting with business leaders big and small, law enforcement, union leaders, the black community.  All he has been doing is nonstop organizing of the best people, hearing out their problems and how the help them, then working to make it happen. \n\nThe dems are delusional. It's not even been 3 weeks yet and it feels like he's been president for a year with everything he's done.    
I would consider this common courtesy so I don't think she deserves props for not being a preachy cunt like Madonna for example. \n\nHowever these are extremely divided times and politics are unavoidable as the media tries to shove down your throat how bad trump is.  So it was refreshing to be able to enjoy a bit of normalcy for once. 
TIL 4chan shitposting is considered unacceptable astroturfing but multi-million dollar political organizations astroturfing is not only allowed but encouraged. And  /r/generictrumphatesub#37 it will get bumped to the front page by a miraculous force that definitely isn't vote manipulation or Reddit admins.          
How could UCF even consider risking to lose public funding and causing untold amounts of damage to programs for LEGAL students and American citizens? \n\nJust follow the law it's that simple. Sick of colleges pushing a recklessly partisan political agenda at the cost of the American taxpayer.   
Sounds more like the creators were told by their bosses to make more shows with the comedic formula of adventure time or SpongeBob. Pretty much all of cartoon networks shows that aren't Tumblr bait follow that formula last time I watched it.    \n\nTeen titans is the only one I liked but I feel like most people don't like it. I felt it did the SpongeBob humor justice once I got over the old teen titans and gave it a chance. 
Occasionally faceplanting on brick and inconveniencing everyone on medium to small pathways as you pass is nothing compared to taking a scooter to the shin.    
Please learn some history before getting political. Texas declared independence from Mexico in 1835 and joined the US in 1845. Mexico tried to get it back and got stomped in the Mexican-American war. The US was given the rest of the land in the treaty of guadalupe Hidalgo, in return Mexico got to keep its government and not get totally BTFO by uncle Sam. \n\nBy your logic Mexico was stolen from Spain and the US still belongs to Britain. \n\nAlso the only reason Americans lived in those parts of Mexico at the time was because Mexico sold them the land for cheap. Mexicans didn't want to live out in the wild west and they needed a buffer zone from the Indians out there. So you could even make the argument that Mexico stole land from the Indians.        
You forgot to say shitlord
Kimi no na wa's success was like 60% hype and that hype was facilitated by the demand for anything close to a miyazaki movie.  \n\nThe story was better than shinkai's other movies but not anything spectacular. 
The main difference is that the Internet allows the truth to surface. It just takes a little while. The problem isn't the Internet allowing uncensored information, it's the people not questioning what they hear or requiring evidence to back up a claim. \n\nBefore the Internet, television and newspapers could twist a story and not be caught, because they controlled the flow of information. Now they're losing their asses every time they lie and people are turning to alternative media. 
Turns out a 90%+ liberal media will glorify liberal Presidents and villainize conservative presidents. I wonder what impact that has on the uninformed neutral/moderate masses.\n\nIt's a rhetorical question of course. People who don't follow actual politics just regurgitate the headlines, usually incorrectly coming to conclusions based on intricately spun misinformation. \n   
I support Trump as much as the next conservative but there is no comparison to the sudden surge of literally dozens of subreddits with anti-trump propaganda to the point that to avoid it, I've had to block half of the NON-POLITICAL subreddits I used to read that have been infiltrated and even despite that, I still see the propaganda forcing its way into subs that have never been political before. \n\nI wouldn't be surprised if there are people brainstorming on how they can shoe-horn propaganda into more subreddits. that's how forced it feels. \n\nMeanwhile there is mainly 1 subreddit that pushes pro-trump propaganda and that subreddit is openly dedicated to trump and doesn't hide it. And that 1 subreddit was the cause of multiple algorithm changes to suppress it and even blocked from the new front page. \n\nIt's not even close and it's ruining this site for a large amount of it's users that don't care for a constant barage of leftwing politics. And before someone says we should care because politics control our lives, there is truth to that but it does not justify this blitz of political noise. It comes across as people in power kicking and screaming because they are losing power, and yelling at the masses, who they are dependent on, through a megaphone, that it is crucial they maintain power.   Most people aren't dumb and if you force something down their throat, they will reject it and often times do the opposite out of spite - part of the reason why trump was elected in the first place.     
The top middle image was Corrine Brown's district which, while originally drawn by Republicans, was heavily defended by Democrats because it was a free seat for them. The Florida districts were redrawn 2 years ago and that gerrymandered district was phased out.  
This was bound to happen eventually. No matter what you do the people in charge will find a way to change the rules when their agenda breaks the rules. \n\nThe only thing keeping them in check is the people. But unfortunately they've started replacing the people with outsiders who support them. 
Multiple white house correspondents at various press briefings have implied simply branding CNN fake news was an infringement on their 1st amendment rights. And it's making its rounds in the news right now as there are a few dozen articles that dance around the idea without directly stating it. \n\nThen it hits the Reddit echo chambers and the implications become arguments and talking points and in a few days I hear people repeating the same misinformation outside of the Internet as gospel. \n\nJust like the "Muslim ban". Just like his Russian business ties. The list goes on and on and the media gets away scot free because the media heavily implied a false narrative but technically didn't state it. 
There are much worse things happening in Germany than a  few dozen skinheads building a wooden swastika. I would argue that it's the neglecting of real issues, that drives people back to these fringe ideologies in the first place.  
In Trumps defense, nothing from Kmart or sears is selling
Except Asians and Indians. \n\nIts almost like being oppressed it a political tool used by the Democrats only when it favors them. 
They should be disqualified from competing for taking performance enhancing drugs regardless of their situation. \n\nOtherwise if "he" wants to be a man so badly, let "him" compete in male wrestling and see how it feels to lose because of an unfair disadvantage. 
That's not saying much. Judging by the Sanders subreddit he was the establishment pick. We all know that didn't stop Hillary or Bernie from pandering to minorities and peddling anti-white rhetoric when the time came. 
The word Racist has become synonymous with bigot. Neither Mexican nor Muslim is a race and yet they've been the topic of ad hominem this entire election. 
Seriously. This is the third or fourth bill gates thread I've seen on the front page in the last day or so. \n\nIm sure he does a lot of nice things but he also probably does it for tax deduction assuming he doesn't abuse tax loopholes like Warren buffet. Also for all the good deeds he does there sure is a large PR campaign to make sure everyone knows about how great he is. Surely there are no ulterior motives. 
Build a negative wall, a moat basically. Fill it with water and alligators. Doubles as a canal.  
Not surprised Google is up to their same old dirty tricks. \n\nI used to consider fascism right wing because a high school history teacher taught us that the extreme right wing ideology is fascism and an extreme leftwing ideology is Communism. \n\nHowever as ive gotten older and watched the world I realized fascism is someone who wants government control and wants to silence opposition, which is the polar opposite of the right wing in this country. If anything the progressive left has symptoms of fascism what with PC censorship and wanting bigger government. 
As you pointed out, the article is misleading. \n\nBesides, supporting drug abuse under the idea of individual liberty makes no sense when the current welfare state infringes on the taxpayer's individual liberty to subsidize the junkie.   \n\nThe libertarian ideology is flawed in that it cannot be half-assed. It requires the populace to be personally responsible for their actions. You cannot allow the benefits of liberty without first allowing the repercussions of liberty otherwise you are  subsidizing irresponsibility and the system fails. 
Watch the left frame this as a purge a la erdogan in Turkey. 
Probably the same reason our government has overlooked the Saudis for decades. They're our "allies"  and we buy oil from them.  Also ISIS fighter activity is low among the more civilized middle eastern countries, and that was one of the main criteria when the list was made. \n\nDont disagree with you though, just answering your question. 
I'm worried too, Reddit has been pretty cancerous lately. 
If you talk shit about someone nonstop, don't expect them  to invite you to their parties. \n\nEspecially if you spread false rumors and made up stories for the sake of fueling your 24/7 hit piece of a network.    
Every time this happens trump gets stronger. And every time the media cries wolf, their voice gets weaker.    \n\n2020 looking to be a good year. 
Wtf racist against whites much?    
Why didn't they seek profits the last 8 years? Oh yeah because their team was in charge.  \n\nThey're partisan hacks, it's not that complicated. 
Trump has said marijuana legalization should be left to the states no? \n\nWhen he talks about stopping drugs poisoning our youth, he means the hard drugs that the cartels are peddling across the border like cocaine, heroin, and meth.\n\nObviously the vast, vast majority of Americans would agree with Trump on this, which is why the headline must rely on misinformation. \n\n   
What race? (hint: Hispanic isn't a race and most Hispanics can and do come here legally) \n\n 
It's almost like the media is overwhelmingly liberal and launched a positive propaganda campaign that turned him into an overnight celebrity for not much more than the color of his skin.   
Literally nothing is wrong.
I'm late to this party and I see the shills are out in force. This Bloomberg article says Trump had nothing to do with the 12 billion decrease https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.bloomberg.com/amp/politics/articles/2017-02-25/trump-seeks-credit-for-debt-reduction-driven-by-normal-cash-flow\n\n>“Anything that has happened to the debt has been on autopilot since Obama left," said Laurence Kotlikoff, an economics professor at Boston University. “If anything, he is taking credit for something Obama did." \n\n**But this one directly contradicts it** by giving republicans credit for reducing the debt later in Obama's presidency https://www.bloomberg.com/quicktake/u-s-budget-battles\n\n>While Democratic President Barack Obama was in the White House, Republicans in Congress repeated the message over and over: federal spending was out of control. To rein it in, Republican lawmakers forced one government shutdown and several near-misses; eventually they reached budget-cutting agreements with Obama that helped pare the deficit for six straight years. \n\n>After the 2008 financial crisis, Obama signed an $830 billion stimulus package. This, along with a decline in tax revenue resulting from high unemployment, triggered explosive growth in the budget deficit. The following year, Republicans captured the House of Representatives running on a platform of fiscal restraint. In 2011, they used the fact that the government was about to hit the debt ceiling, a limit Congress sets on the amount that can be borrowed, to threaten a debt default. They’d only provide money to keep things running if Obama agreed to big spending cuts. The resulting Budget Control Act put limits on spending by the Pentagon and other cabinet departments. These caps, expected to save $1 trillion over a decade, were combined with a tax increase on the wealthiest earners to help shrink the annual deficit to $439 billion in 2015. \n\nSo if Trump "is taking credit for something Obama did", what did Obama do? Oh that's right, he listened to Republicans who had control of Congress and reigned in some of the deficit. If Democrats had kept control, our debt would probably be double what it is.   \n\n**New contracts with Boeing etc, the federal hiring freeze, and less government regulations are saving us billions.** Oh, but President Trump had nothing to do with that according to some people. Yet, the 200 billion increase in Obama's first month (mostly from the failed stimulus bill he signed into law in Feb 2009) was to clean up the mess left by Bush. All Bush's fault, (even though the housing market crisis was a direct result of policies passed by Bill Clinton like the repeal of Glass Steagall). \n\nWhy didn't Obama bring back jobs like President Trump did, instead of spending 200 billion of our money for nothing? If 12 billion was cut in the first month, imagine how amazing the next four years will be.
I have a feeling you're being too hard on yourself. You said you were talking a bit, I would guess that no one other than yourself thought it was weird. Sounds like you did fine (without your analysis) and I doubt people criticise you in their heads as much as you think. 
Is the gift a sinking feeling in your stomach?
They invited you to have lunch. They don't try to keep you out either. I just think you have the wrong perspective here. Maybe I'm wrong in my assumption. 
That's true but it doesn't change the validity of the info. Should they be leaking?  No, but I do want to see what it is.
Who's a good cloud?
I've asked my Republican uncle this. "Because of the oppressive federal government"
I love pizza as well, thanks. 
I think Nov 9th will be the start of the more entertaining half of this election.
Exactly, crying wolf for the 30th time. I totally believe it this time /s
Just wonder what he's trying to distract us from. Maybe I'm giving him too much credit though
That's what has made me realize they don't care. They'll rationalize everything and since then they have. There's no reasoning to be done.
Because it proves that every article from snopes or politifact is fake /s
Wow, that's a really cool comic
You either had a chance and missed it or never had a chance and she wanted validation. Either way, if you want to get her a gift you would be getting a gift for a friend. If she's got a bf now you're out of luck my friend. 
God Speed
At least they aren't pissed at you. Though the Kraken is always a one shot dick

I can't even watch those anymore. It's the same tired arguments that don't hold even a drop of water. Being a downer, my bad!
Prove its a takedown by the CIA. No one knows what actually happened thats why they're investigating. I wouldn't be surprised if it turns out either way.
If we could only get a holding call
As long as the pats don't win. After that, as long as the rest of the AFC west doesn't win :)
I think he's full of it but I'll still read it.
Sounds like he's going to ruin himself. I know you still like him and care about him but in my opinion you should lay low and the owners will solve your problem soon. If he's being that much of an idiot it won't be long. Sorry to sound so callus but I have no sympathy for people like that. He made his bed so he can lie in it.
Do the majority of subscribers here think that Climate change is wrong or not man made?

Out of all the places to rob... what thought process leads you to rob a gun store?
I always loved doing skills in RS. What was different vs other mmos. At least the ones I played. I can see that though.
More or less the reason I sub here too. I try to hear the other side and I've found this sub isn't ridiculous like some others. To be fair I think you can have a conversation here a lot easier than r/politics or r/t_d
Awesome, love the shock diamonds. I made a LOX/Methane igniter for my thesis. I think that's at white Sands in NM. Thanks for sharing!
Jeb is so screwed haha
Beer, weed, cats, bacon, females, reddit, AND skyrim? This guy fucks.
I get that man, definitely a shitty situation. Don't want to preach so I'll leave it there. I hope you go again if you get an invite.
Something about pets or something. Not sure, haven't played in a few hours.
Cool man, hope my RNG is good today! 
You can also get the T Mobile data cap alerts in high res.
I wouldn't label them all as dumb, though I'm sure many are. A lot of it has to do with hatred for Hillary and I don't really blame them for that. If the Democrat candidate was mostly clean I would agree with you. 
I disagree. Tinder is very superficial. Looks are easily 80-90% 
Agreed but Tinder is the most superficial dating thing I've used. Looking for a diamond in the rough.
/r/thathappened
I'm just glad I diversified my memes
Ha, good point. It's all good as long as it's my team. 
Trying their hardest to give it to Alabama
That's pretty accurate.
I think she's just trying to cover herself, so she doesn't look bad. I wouldn't bother man, she will ignore you again. Don't want to go through it all twice. Then again, maybe I'm just cynical.
That's exactly what I'm doing right now. 
Agreed but Tinder is the most superficial dating thing I've used. Looking for a diamond in the rough.
Trump IRL?
Cue all the consitutional conservatives codemning this statement.... nah I'm just kidding.
Sucks that you still have Snapchat
Holy shit, that's amazing. 
She's not interested in you from this. If you want to do more than study than forget it. Nothing wrong with group study. If she wants you to do work for her though then bail.
There's a ton of logical problems with that. Don't try to make sense of it :) just remember it's always the Democrats fault.
How long did you go for more popcorn mang?
I hope not
I wouldn't really consider the opinion shows on either side as more than entertainment. I was just giving the other side to the comment I was responding to.
Haha, damn. Are gremlin a thing?
Cheers homie.
I disagree, I put blame on both sides. Everyone seems to dismiss contrary evidence. In my opinion the right is very blind to what is going on, intentional or not, about Russian influence. I don't think it will change the election results at this point but should be very concerning at the least.
Not surprising honestly. Was a good run Sanders.
Damn\nMe too, thanks.
I listened to a podcast along the lines of "Is the Catholic Church beyond saving?" While I know many decent catholics it just seems like this kind of stuff is endemic of the church and it's very sad.
Don't bother man. I'm average and Tinder is shit for me. Better off going to a bar to crash and burn there. 
It's pretty funny but sad at the same time
Different sources at different levels yes, but its private info being made public. I think thats the point.
Not at all, plausible deniability! 
Non whites can't be racist, silly. /s
Shit, I'd message her
Thanks for the info. Got 2 pieces so far. I usually have good rng so we'll see.
The Cruz defense. Bold move
Could have used this guy back in the day...
More like "target acquired"
I think people have a click bait problem. Doesn't matter which side you're on.
Rare to see a niceguy with a SO. Nice find
Good article, we need more like this. Props.
Finally one I actually think is plausible. Dick don't care!
They live in a castle. I can't imagine it's comfortable or practical. Didn't see any air conditioners on top either. 
You're doing it wrong, man. Gotta do the bandwagon thing.
Ignoring a lot of circumstances. Twitter makes a lot more sense now.
Wait, Bush could have done it? :O\nI mean, me too, thanks.
I'm sad that you choose no treatment but I won't pretend to know your life or situation. I hope you find some sort of comfort in your remaining time. I'm not very religious so I'll see you on the other side. God speed homie.
Seems pretty normal for the circumstances to me, bud.
How malnurished do you have to be for your body to literally start using brain cells for energy?

Lavender auto sprays and my childhood
Feel kind of bad for the guy. He didn't seem like the entitled beards we see here. 
The one time I'm actually working and not on Reddit I miss the apocalypse. Now I can only participate ironically :(
I've got some links that might help with that.
Honestly I wonder. I feel the line is very far from Trump's comments but I have nothing to compare it to. It's possible liberals would have defended Obama if he said it but I hope not.
Haha, I'm sure the front page will be flooded with that tomorrow. Sanders was a long shot before today. It's almost impossible now unfortunately. Even if the 20 points doesn't hold, Honestly he needs to win.
Didn't know you guys had this, will hopefully do alright this week :) and if the Broncos lose probably not come back for a week or two.
Even if you send your kids to private school you still pay for public school through your taxes. I wouldn't worry about the atheist perspective. More than likely she'll try to give government money to private schools vs public. I could be wrong but I doubt she has much influence on what's taught. That has more to do with what Texas is buying which doesn't make me feel any better either. If you're a freshman I'd guess the changes won't be felt until your junior or senior year.
Replace left with right and it's still an accurate statement
Wed after work is pretty close!
Great feeling when you find the book you need with 2 seeders. How they can get away with changing some hw problems for a new edition I'll never understand. 
It's crazy browsing new. 155 comments and 20 points. Waiting for the sanders spin piece to blow up.
Petite Asian... I'm so sorry. You're definitely beard bait but that doesn't mean this guy is so bad. Don't get me wrong, he's definitely a beard but as long as he's tolerable I would just tell him that you're not interested. Don't tell him you're gay because he could be a spiteful asshole, not worth the risk. As a former neckbeard, as long as you keep your distance and he doesn't do anything drastic you should be fine. If it gets bad then you should start worrying. Sounds a bit annoying but not sure if you doing anything but distancing yourself at this point would really help.
I love the comments calling him out. I always see these statuses but no one calling them out.
Haha, I love it
It is amazing you do not see the difference of being bought and paid for as a life long politician versus hiring successful business persons. Yea he should have went and hired the homeless man when he meant draining the swamp that way no career politician claim could be made and no bought and paid for swamp names could be named. You liberals just cannot wrap your head around a career politician versus a career businessman and how their actions can be seen differently. It is almost like you are paid for yourself
Fuck civil disobedience at this point we are preventing half the american populace from effecting the wills of their votes. Right now most protestors are acting treasonous 
No most cars will not however most people have to spend a lot repairing their cars for EVAP codes, CAT codes and O2 sensors. Emission regulations make up a good cost of the car
Yes I realize that and you think I have an issue with that. It is up to the integrity of the politician not to be bought I do not expect people to not try to play the game. So now they are in charge doing what is best for business and the best for business is the best for middle class. I do not see a problem
lol that is what you took away from the entire conference.......
wow
I would give it an A- or B+. I really like how the media is being taken down a notch, the supreme court pick, and his cabinet. He has surprised me with how well he is doing
Ehhhh I would like to see us go away from private prisons and go away from loretta lynchs style of prisons. Prisons have gotten entirely too soft with regulatory measures from the federal government which empowers inmates and takes control away from the CO's/facility. We see it more and more with prison riots look at the case in delaware were they were afraid Trump was going to take away their programs or more riots in which inmates are afraid of losing entitlements like college education. Our prisoners now have the ability to scream PREA if they don't want to be patted down, special rights given to transgenders that put other inmates in actual danger of rape, they have to comply with ADA specifics so that the murderer who has back issues and is "disabled" gets to go into a better housing unit with a handicap accessible shower and then gets to slash another inmate just because he should have never been in that housing unit in the first place due to his violent nature. We had an attorney general who wanted to stop calling them inmates and start calling them "people that offend" that way inmates do not get offended by the language. We had a president and attorney general that wanted to make it illegal on housing applications for landlords to deny housing to someone with a felony as it was "racist" meanwhile giving little concern to how their neighbors felt about a violent offender living next to their families. We have judges who side with inmates when it comes to officers making an inmate shower, scrub their toilets or perform basic human tasks because making an un-sentenced inmate work is a violation of the thirteenth amendment even if you are trying to make them do basic hygiene tasks for their own health and safety......the prison system is madness right now
I believe she was flicking her bean to her sister while she was a teenager and sharing a bed together thinking of her sweaty body.......I am sorry but if you are at seven years old rewarding a younger person for sexual gratification it shows some deeper darker issues
didnt he work for the Obama administration also?
I am, anything dealing with the taking away of our constitutional rights should always be government run. I was a private prison fan in the beginning but I think there is just too much room for corruption and unfortunately the hunt for the bottom dollar results in poorer run facilities and poorly payed and trained staff. The problem with a lot of programs right now is we allow everyone to go indiscriminately much of that resulting from state and federal guidelines. So the high ranking blood member gets to go to a program along with low ranking members trying to get out of the gang or joe blow who is trying to better himself. The high ranking gang member uses the programs to pass contraband throughout the facility, recruit and overall just to get out of their housing unit with no intention on bettering themselves. This results in disruption of the program due to peer pressure to fit in, conform for safety and results in the program failing. All in all we tend to cater to the worst in the prison system and protect their rights more so than the ones who could actually become rehabilitated all because the government would come down on us pretty hard if we said the gang member couldn't attend the program. We cater to the lowest common denominator while we ignore the masses all for the sake of equal treatment in the facility. It would be as in a school classroom if we catered to the disruptive kid all class long while ignoring the rest of the students. Sure some kids might succeed on their own but how much better could the class have been if we just kicked out the disruptive kid and focused our attention on the rest of the class
I could care less if milo got rake through the coals however it is frustrating to see the double standard in the media and the underlying cause not being the issue at hand but the party affiliation of the person.
But hey New York wants to make safe heroin clinics so you can go shoot up and have medical on sight in case anything bad happens. If you want to smoke though you'll have to step outside
I am telling you my experience as a poor person going to middle class. We now making 95k together with our incomes and it was a hell of a lot harder to get out of poverty with the social programs than it would have if we were all treated equally. You have to make the choice if you want that promotion but want to take a spending cut when you lose your assistance. Going from making 38k a year to 45k a year but losing 10 grand in family assistance is a big deal and there is little incentive to take that promotion. The only incentive is hoping down the road that job experience pays off and it did for me. Many people it does not. 
I know I am not a big fan of laying down the ban hammer but people are just trolling and vote brigading at this point
hes a fucking kid you pervert
Please you did not vote for Trump get out of here with that. I loved the news conference he tore the media a new one as they should have been for getting all horned up over Flynn like it was the fall of the administration. He proved the difference between picking a bad password and getting hacked to insiders left over from Obama leaking administration to the press. He pointed out the hypocrisy and double standards of the press and their vitrol and hatred for him. 
http://cis.org/Welfare-Use-Legal-Illegal-Immigrant-Households\n\nIt just changes the qualification for who can receive welfare, you can still receive it if you are illegal \n\nalso \n\nOn January 29, 2010, the final rules implementing the 2002 Farm Bill\n1 established new eligibility and certification requirements for the receipt of SNAP benefits.  The 2008 Farm Bill then changed the name of the program from the Food Stamp Program to SNAP.  All of the changes presented important reasons for this update of FNS’s 2003 Guidance.  "
CNN Headline\nTrump Says "Im afraid he is going to give me a kiss" TRUMPS ANTI GAY RHETORIC AT RALLY IS DESTROYING AMERICA!
How do you boo a program to protect victims of a crime. 
If he brings out the worst in people the worst is just hiding and it's good people are showing their true colors
In some ways they are there was federal grants available for manufacturing plants in our area were they supplemented the wages if they hired felons. All in all that is great however there is a lot of public outcry when the veteran coming back from Iraq gets passed over for a felon because the company is saving money 
My fiances gym class required sports bras to be worn they had to take off their regular bras and put on a sports bra.
That is because that is not the logic they are using. No one is justifying pedophilia they are pointing out the difference of treatment between a conservative that advocates for pedophilia and a liberal that advocates for pedophilia. No one is saying Milo is justified because Takei said it they are wanting justice for both sides. 
Because this is America and the president doesn't have to deal with people that attempt to deligitimize him
Oh my god as a New Yorker yes they both are the reason I'm pro choice
I feel it is a threat however joe blow trying to pass inspection so he can continue driving to work is a great threat to joe blow. I think we would have much more acceptance of regulation on climate change type behavior maybe if we regulated the upper class like we do lower class and middle class people. Like hey Leo you can only fly 5 places a year on your jumbo jet, and Al Gore you have to turn the hot water tanks off when you leave you mansions unoccupied else you face a heft fine, than maybe just maybe joe blow wouldn't be so angry about regulations
Knock it off with the fallacies its intellectual laziness at its finest. Both parties were wrong all people want is for both to be treated equally in the medias eyes for their stances on pedophilia and not because one is liberal and one is conservative. Conservatives are rightly bashing Milo and holding them accountable the only thing they want to see is George held accountable by the same standards because what it really comes down to is that the left is not angry that Milo is encouraging pedophilia but that he is a platform for the conservative media and that is not right. That is all this conversation is, Milo was wrong george is wrong in conservatives eyes, whereas in liberals eyes george is fine and milo was wrong and this boils down to their political affiliation. \n\n"SOME ANIMALS ARE MORE EQUAL THAN OTHERS" Orwell
No I want handout reform because the current system we have in place does not encourage or reward people for getting off of the handouts. The income bracket between 40-75k is the ones getting screwed. Rich enough not to receive any aid and poor enough not to be able to save for a rainy day. No one is looking in their neighbors bowl they are looking in their own bowl seeing that which is taken from them and being given to their neighbor. 
Wait you just said law and order is used by politicians for fear then in the next paragraph state that the money used for the wall would be better allocated for fighting crime. Which one is it?
Same here I have never written a President but I wrote this one to let him know I support him but he will never see me marching for or against him as we tend to stay quiet
He was getting so angry at a women I thought he was going to get an NFL contract
Damn the irony in the dem response
fighting holds shitheads accountable. Even your non fighters understand the importance of holding a Sean Avery type accountable and not letting them run around with free reign and only a fine, game misconduct as punishment
The end of the game when Miller blocks the SO attempt. FUCKING A that was the most I ever loved this team after this game. The day I realized this team was dead was when Lucic took a run at Miller and Gaustad did a half ass fight with him the next game. That is when I knew the spirit of the 05-06 and 06-07 team was dead
Yes the entire link states how requirements changed to allow illegal immigrants (people in the country that are not here legally) can obtain food stamps etc. You like to play word games however you are either a legal citizen of this country or not. If you are not you are not entitled to any of the benefits our country has to offer therefor you should not receive them. Sorry if you feel the other way about that however since you made this post and feel illegal immigrants shouldn't be hired or be allowed to work because of their status and we should punish employers for doing so I guess you are just as xenophobic as me
You completely missed the whole context of the point I was trying to make. I work my ass off and got little to extra spending cash because I was middle class, My fiance who made less had more spending money then someone who made twice as much as her due to public assistance. That is fucking over the middle class. Fucking over the middle class is making it worthwhile to stay on assistance versus bettering yourself and getting off of it. Hence the by getting a pay raise we got a cut in spending cash because of it. Democrats used to be the champions of the middle class now they just want to give everyone a free ride 
Well sir I do believe that is very unpopular HE FUCKING CHICKEN WINGED HIM
A 10 year old girl at my representatives town hall asked our representative if he was really going to dismantle the EPA....Yes a 10 year old asked that question. If you do not think people are being told what to say or ask then you are mistaken
I think you misunderstand the definition of racist. Non citizens can be anyone from anywhere just are not citizens of this country (unless you think non-citizens are just brown people which if that is the case you need to sit in the mirror and reflect a bit). Also if you think that illegal immigrants are not receiving food stamps or welfare under these guidelines you are ill informed
Fine the business owners and no welfare for illegal immigrants and that is a start. 
Come on I am in a union and laugh at the old timers that go with the blood and fighting made the 40 hour work week like they are world war 2 vets coming back from normandy when in reality unions today fight for shitty employees to still be employed while good employees cannot get ahead and get paid the same as the shitty employee. Face it having people that know how businesses work is the best thing for businesses to succeed in this country and when businesses succeed the middle class succeeds and a strong middle class is the key to a strong country
That hit still lives in infamy one of the best games ever. 
Illegal immigrant households receive an average of $5,692 in federal welfare benefits every year, far more than the average "native" American household, at $4,431, according to a new report on the cost of immigration released Monday.\n\nThe Center for Immigration Studies, in an analysis of federal cost figures, found that all immigrant-headed households — legal and illegal — receive an average of $6,241 in welfare, 41 percent more than native households. As with Americans receiving benefits such as food stamps and cash, much of the welfare to immigrants supplements their low wage jobs.\n\n

Prison should serve three aspects\n1. Punishment for the crime\n2. Protection for society from criminals\n3. Rehabilitation\n\nI think our prison system would benefit from a timeline sentence and re-classification of offenders. So you get sentenced to 5 years with 3 years post release supervision. You go for two years to fuck you punitive prison were you do nothing but serve your time in a shitty cell eating slop. Sure you will interact with other criminals and some criminals will thrive and make connections but we have that now. In the prison your behavior in such a setting concludes what happens in the next 3 years. If you have been well behaved in this prison you get transferred to a lower level prison were you strive to better yourself. There are rehabilitative programs from everything to narcotics abuse to shop classes. They teach you how to function in society, how to fill out a 1040 ez form, balance a check book, obtain a GED, be a better parent or spouse etc. If you successfully engage in this setting then you get out a year early not into parole but set up with a social worker for a year to get you on your feet. If not than you spend another year in the program if you are bad you get sent back to punitive prison with a conditional 3 years parole. \n\nWhat we have no is a classification system however your guy spending 20 years for murder gets to interact with the dude that is doing 3 years for robbery and the guy doing 10 years for selling heroin. They all mix and the guy doing ten years recruits the guy doing 3 years meanwhile the guy doing 20 years is busy in a prison gang trying to survive. It makes no sense sending a guy to shop class or rehabiltative programs that is not going to see the light of day for another 20 years. Focus on the tail end of their sentences instead of letting everyone attend because the bad apples then spoil the bunch
Emotional bs is your reply.....All president Obama did was respond to every national incident with emotion. Trayvon could have been his son, hands up don't shot, Beer summit, You can keep your doctor, attacking gun owners after every shooting and on and on. Come on look at the Dallas shooting which the shooter was supported by the BLM movement which the President had come to the white house and he blames guns after.\n \n\nPresident Obama used emotional reactions to situations to further the polarization of America and you want to say my response is emotional. Middle America, the ones that work 40 hours a week, holidays and bust their ass to put their kids into good schools, food on the table and are taught respect and hard work pays off got shit on by the President for the last 8 years. Hard work was never rewarded in his cycle however the loudest whiners got a visit from the President to hear their struggles. Meanwhile if you are considered poor you get the entire shabang handed to you while friends I have who make a little over 50k in their small business are getting the shaft trying to do things right. 
Yes there is, what rock are you living under
Look at my post history lived through this..lost more spending money by getting a raise then not\n
The choice was to do the right thing. Doing the right thing is not required but often times is the smartest in the long run. If she would not have had WIC she would have gotten by just fine, if she had not have gotten college tuition paid for she would have had to take out loans like the rest of the middle class. Now we both have good paying jobs but she has a foot up on spending income wheras I could have invested that money I had to pay for college in funds. 
Well we did get that with Clinton and her Cheese Pizza Parties
Yea draining the swamp ment no more appointments of career politicians to cabinet positions with a one hand washes the other type deal. And for Dodd frank it made it extremely hard for small banks and businesses to compete. Competition is good for the market. I wouldn't expect you to entirely get that though hating trump at this point it purely an emotional decision\n
I know there was that one judge getting paid off for higher sentences. Don get me wrong most jails which house a large portion of our incarcerated population are run by elected officials and are often the first thing cut from county budgets so less training, less supplies etc same problems private prisons face just beuracrqtc bullshit makes them cost more. I just think there is more opportunity for corruption from private prisons lobbying than sheriffs cutting budgets
That video is so disappointing to watch again. And then the next time they played Gaustad gave a half ass fight against him. It was at this point that I knew that the Sabres I loved were no more
Oh please I am a true conservative and even Mark Levin in his book writes that there is a place for government to spend money and protect the welfare of the people usually through military might. The wall is about the most conservative thing we can do. It is not like we are building million dollar bridges over places not travelled
That is true I registered as an independent but haven't voted for a democrat even in local elections because of their stance on the second
The Canadiens do not drug test for their social media department. Good to know
I feel the same way
If you ever need proof that there are paid commenters or brigades this it the thread to show them. Conservative here and if you cannot print anything without sensational headlines in an attack against the President I don't really care if he hand picks media outlets. 
Backing criminals and sending white house representatives to their funerals while ignoring cops being shot. Some say his rhetoric encouraged it. Backing rioters while hard working Americans suffer. Backing the poor while shitting on the middle class with obamacare
We had to get changed in front of each other in school. It was part of gym class. My fiance went to a different school and got a lower grade because she didn't want to change in front of others. Now looking back on the kids in our class that have come out as transgender they were the biggest gossipers. The last thing some little girl or guy needs is somebody from the opposite gender telling everyone about how their parts look
Billy Bob Thornton is hard up these days
Any logical person can answer that. You have 76% of our illegal immigration coming from the southern border. A wall seriously complicates those crossing the barren land. Think of it as a parking lot and you have to patrol the entire parking lot to make sure no one crosses. That job is pretty hard almost like a game of red rover were you can only catch one person. Now build a wall on the parking lot yea people will still cross but it is easier to catch them crossing than just patrolling a barren piece of land. You really think ending welfare benefits will get rid of it. Absolutely not they will turn to more crime or rely on cartels to supply their neighborhoods with goods. 
Fuck that was cool. You know those times in a day were you spend some time day dreaming that your favorite teams GM sees you playing beer hockey and gives you a one day pass on the team. That was this guys moment in real life with the fucking President
My life insurance does it pretty efficiently
Is that a wrong fight to pick to point out both wrongs. Just because something happened that is terrible does not mean you cannot care or have to care less about a different topic. It seems you are just trying to silence the lefts hypocrisy and an opposing viewpoint by relating that anything but pure hatred for Milo which we have here is an agreement with pedophilia and you want to talk about fallacies. Like I said in this discourse Milo has been held accountable by the right and the left however the left will refuse to hold George accountable and that makes it seem like the left didn't care about Milo's issue but the fact that he was conservative and saw the pedophilia comments as a way to take silence him not point out an obvious wrong
Other than the fact that the linked article states there are ways for undocumented people to receive welfare and food stamps......And come on really my entire family is immigrants, my neighbors are immigrants the thing is we all did it legally and are working and have assimilated. Way to stereotype
Did one also
And those entire departments have grown to big for their own good. They have become regulators for survival meaning that if they do not regulate something then they do not get a budge raise the next year. A lot of the government agencies sole existence relies on spending their entire budget so they get the same budget for the next year. It is an endless cycle with no incentives for cutting back
Clintons not president no suicides
The left hates anyone successful 
Cigarette smoke.
Yea not like he put a ban on members lobbying after they are done with the administration.......Or wants term limits. You liberals are so obsessed with Russian dick but completely ignore the fact that Bernie had a soviet flag on his desk, honeymooned in Moscow, joined a communist commune, traveled to multiple Russian puppet states and still hangs a leader of the bolshevik movement in his senate office........You never cared about Russia until you thought it was an out for deligitimizing Trump
I became very conservative in college. I used to love sitting around laughing at john Stewart and making fun of bush jr. Then I went to college and got lecture about how I am a racist because I am white, and how we needed to vote for obama to right our historic wrongs (yes a professor dedicated a fifty minute lecture to this). 
This is how I feel when I deal with my cable company......They make me like that
When those politicians say law and order they mean actions have consequences. Liberal democrats love to look at the criminal and take pity whereas republicans look at the victim and take pity. Law and order stems from politicians being soft on crime and handing out small sentences to criminals allowing them to get out and start terrorizing their communities again. Like child predators only getting a few years in prison or smaller "victimless" crimes getting a pass, illegal immigrants getting a pass, petit larceny, drug dealing etc
I take my daughter into the women's room. If anyone says anything just tell them you identify as a women and you are her mom.
I see like three of the same comments/talking points in here. I agree conversation is good however I shouldn't have to scroll to the bottom of a conservative sub reddit to view conservative opinons. I notice this a lot of Trump talk it seems like they are trying to sway moderate conservatives away by popular think tank. Like "ohh other conservatives think this I should think that too"
I hate them because of what they represent hypocrisy at its finest. Look at Coumo my governor he instituted a travel ban for all state employees to a state he disagrees with on politics however has an issue with Trumps EO. Look at Schumer crying on a stadium while a few years prior he agreed with Obamas EO. I am in a very large Union and they are corrupt as shit. The vast majority of our members supported trump however who did our dues go to? that is right the democratic super pacs. \n\nAnd yes I do expect some of our problems to be solved by using people that know how to run a business because they know what people want. \n\nI cannot imagine why anyone would go brigade a sub that goes against their viewpoints without other interests on the line. Coming across a differing opinion on r/all is one thing but actively searching out a differing opinion to argue against is another. I am not on r/socialism citing Mises because well I do not have a vested interest in going and stirring the shit pot unless I am getting paid or unless I feel my views are losing out on popularity and I need to change public perception. You obviously have a vested interest whether you think you are losing and you need to go into another sub to defend your views and cancel out an opposing argument or maybe you are getting paid to do so I am not sure but I can tell you that it is not normal to do and is a sign indicative of something else\n\nAlso looking at your post history you are accused of being a shill multiple times. If the shoe fits I would suggest you wear it
I dont think it is that big of a deal. She likes your kid and is comfortable enough to joke about it with you
I think it comes down to lifestyle choices and preventable diseases to care for the unforseen circumstances. Your wife gets breast cancer or child gets a brain tumor that is terrible and as a society I feel for those people. Bertha gets lung cancer after smoking for 40 years or Tim has type 2 diabetes because he ate mcdonalds every day I do not feel it is my job to sustain their shitty life choices
Watch his speech at the catholic dinner for me it broke his ties with elites
I take it you have never watched the show. It pokes fun at stereotypes and then the end ties together with a "these stereotypes are true because of white people" I used to love the show until they sat around one day complaining about unarmed shootings and how any black person can be shot. The show has turned into lefty la la land
Ok let me tell you why. My fiance is considered a poor single mom in NYS. At the time of this I made 38k a year. When we first started dating we got knocked up and times were tough. We lived in a 200 sq ft apartment that cost 325 a month for rent to try to save up money for a house. She was still in school and I was just out of school. I had 30 k in student loans and for a year before we met I at nothing but Kraft mac n cheese and ramen noodle soup so I could put every penny I made down on my loans. By the time we got knocked up I owed 10 grand left. So anyhow while she was pregnant she was on WIC which was a good program however gave her way to much food than any single mom would need. I was eating eggs and cheese, the family was getting loafs of bread and gallons of milk because we just couldn't eat it all. Next her being considered a single mom working 16 hours a week minimum wage in NYS got her last 4 semesters of college paid for with about 1500 dollars more each semester in aid to use to books etc. We used it for a downpayment for a house.....Meanwhile remind you I have not gotten a penny even though she made around 15 grand a year and I made 38k. So now we go onto having our kid. The hospital bill is enormous she is on medicaid however I am on a high deductible plan. I get to the pay the bill out of pocket which is 1700 dollars. Go on next to child care in which she still considered a single mom gets a grant for discounted child care. She tells WIC we got engaged they tell her they have to start figuring in the fathers salary. We make a little over 5 grand too much for WIC so they tell her to just claim child support and that way the fathers salary wont be figure in and to also sign up for food stamps as well. She has to much pride and stops WIC. Daycare now figures our salaries together and we make 5 grand too much as well and the same with medicaid. So now that we are doing things the right way we experience probably a solid 8 grand loss in aid just because we were doing things the right way working hard. Not to mention I had to pay off my student loans and she got half of college for free just for being poor. Not to mention she is still paying off the first 4 semesters while NYS now wants to give free college to everyone while we are still paying. There is a shit ton more considering we are still not married and she makes less than 30 k and I make 55k now putting her in the low income bracket and me in middle class. From taxes, assistance to grants the middle class get fucked. \n\nIt is ridiculous the more you try to do the right thing the the more you get fucked. We would have been much better off stating we did not know who the father was, living in a low level apartment and raking in aid and saving our money than we were by doing it the right way and being honest. Seeing social programs beg her not to cancel them and try to divert her to other programs was sickening. Seeing that there is no incentive to do better because making more you had less. \n\nSo yes I know the middle class gets fucked by the poor from personal experience of being poor, being middle class and having a poor girlfriend\n\n\nPS: Obama sucked at race relations it wasn't tricky wait until the facts come out and then comment. He couldn't even do that. He didn't give any of them lip service he gave them the presidential nod of approval to continue forward with their cop hating, anti white agenda. 
Yea he has been doing what he says and I a conservative that started out hating trump love it
Good thing they aren't regular joes but people highly esteemed in the free market. I work for the government and have been there so long that I do not think I would be good at running it because I am so used to the beurocratic bull that goes along with everything. We have eight levels of management in my department, to get anything done is an act of congress. Government needed to change and thank god it is
Knew you would post the first paragraph and not read further down the line \n\n"Although many non-citizens are now eligible for SNAP, "
Why so far away?
And government has been managing way too much. The EPA overreaches its bounds with its regulations making it harder on small companies, businesses and poor people. Look at car regulations and cat converters for instance. The poor person that probably cannot afford to replace their car with these insane regulations now has to either buy a new one or try to bypass the regulation. A lot of these regulations are put into place to justify the branches existence. 
You know those day dreams you have of picking up a hockey stick and just magically being gretzky good at hockey and winning the Stanley cup for your hometown team and taking a pay cut to help with the salary cap so they can pay the young prospects and they erect a statue of you in the plaza. Yup their officially over
My thought process\n\nOhh terrible she must be dead. Oh their removing the skin maybe a surgical procedure? OHHH FUCK HER EYES ARE MOVING!
Curbing the illegal arms trade from weapons coming in to the US, Using it to curb illegal deadly drugs laced with dangerous substances killing americans, using it to provide for the welfare and well being of US citizens......Ohhhh wait that is what a wall will solved
It is simple. When someone buys a politician they are doing it for a specific interest often times unknown in backroom shady deals. When a business person has their name directly involved in the betterment of the country such as Trump or Tillerson they tend to take special interest into the entire welfare of the country as a whole befitting the nation and when the nation benefits a side effect might be the company benefits as well
I didn't know illegal immigrants and dead people count as the half
Look like you didn't read the links but I understand facts are not set up for you and do not fit into your perspective. Citizen ship should in fact be the litmus test for who receives taxpayer dollars which are taken from actual citizens. And yes that is what your post states correct? "If they wanted to stop illegal immigration they would fine businesses that hire illegal immigrants" 
Your liberal friends were never ever going to vote for Trump even if tomorrow he came out and started giving free college away, healthcare, abortions, sex reassignment surgery etc
LOL this guy came through some blue collar middle management. Fuck if I don't hear "you gotta do this or youll get a pecker paddlin" or "hes been on time lately because he got his pee pee slapped" every week
I'm sure Obama bugged their meeting, so we'll soon find out.  Obama is a disgrace.\nSessions is an honest man.  He needs to come out hard against these obstructionists.   They fear him.  Gee, I wonder why.
WHAT DID THEY TALK ABOUT?  SHE MUST STEP DOWN NOW!  THIS IS AN OUTRAGE! 
Pelosi is such a liar.
This entire thing is getting ridiculous, foreign diplomats are here for the express purpose of talking to our government and it's officials in order to convey the interests and positions of their government and it's officials. Obviously if there is some quid pro quo or bribery going on we should be aware and punish it, but to act shocked when Russian diplomats meet people who have a hand in shaping U.S. foreign policy is just asinine. 
We can't know unless we get a special prosecutor to go after Pelosi and her Democratic gang.
I mean meeting with ambassadors is part of your job as a politician. As Sessions has been saying. I don't understand why Democrats were so quick to say they didn't meet with any Russian officials when it's so easily disproved. I'm not a conservative but it's pretty tough to defend.\n\nThat said, one of Sessions meetings with Kislyac was apparently a private meeting at Sessions' office. Even if he wasn't colluding with the Russians to alter the election, it's pretty far fetched to think they didn't at least discuss the election at all. Even if they were just shooting the breeze about it.
Just happy it wasn't butt gas.
Ohhh right! I googled it and was thinking either it's something obvious I'm forgetting or the 1996 WS had way more to do with the Global Dairy Trade than I realized.

This is off topic, but what is a "9/11 Libertarian"?
Does he always ask them to air James Bond movies or does he mix it up depending on how he's feeling that day? And is he always suicidal?  And why does he want the movies to air around the time of the leftovers if he's not going to watch the show?\n\nI have so many questions for this man.
Mahalo ya fuckin surfers!
Very interesting article about the history of the left over the last 100 years or so. Title doesn't do it justice.
Vid is 12:52 long. So close...
They should get Engels Merkel to direct a reboot.
I was alone at my apartment screaming "FUCKING TRAVEL!" at my TV every time Millsap caught a pass at the top of the arc and went to drive. I was glad Wally backed me up on that bc I thought I was just being a crazy homer by the end of the game.
Kareem made a joke about being Michael Jordan at the 2016 DNC. Something along the lines of "Trump probably can't tell the difference anyway."
I hated them at the time that they were huge, but it was more bc they were just fucking everywhere.  They've grown on me over time, but yeah, still not the biggest fan. \n\nWherever opens the door for you. My dad got me a Ramones greatest hits CD when I was a kid bc I liked "I wanna be sedated" when I heard it on the radio.
More like WEAK amirite.\n\nKidding I love them all.
I'm still not really clear. Is he saying he's better off being a nazi bc at least nazi viewpoints can be considered free speech, whereas minding your own business gets you punched bc "minding your own business" is not protected?

I know 90% of people on this planet hate the Yankees, but they got their shortstop Didi Gregorious and second baseman Starlin Castro to recreate this scene for an ad for the team last season. Pretty funny.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/VxX_b-bZLIQ
The Libertines did something kinda like that for the deluxe version of their last record. I'll always love the crap quality bootlegs I've been listening to for 15 yrs more than the polished studio versions, but it's still cool to hear them dust the old tunes off and give them a proper release.
YES Network gets a lot of criticism for showing 10 replays of every run-of-the-mill groundout, but I feel like MSG is annoying the other way.\n\nHernangomez fouls on that last play, you've got plenty of time to show a quick replay while they're setting up to shoot 2. Why don't they?
Thanks for the response. I asked someone over the phone and she said no. But only in the "if it doesn't say you need one on the application then I don't think so" kind of way.\n\nI'll call again and hope I get somebody else who can give me a definitive thumbs up or thumbs down.
Oh man I was at that game. The place went bananas.
I can't believe it even sold 113 copies.
While particularly more important for Dems now than in the recent past, I don't see one man really having that much of an impact. I mean, is anyone changing their vote to or from the Republican Party because Ronna Romney McDaniel is party chair?
Dude you're a Browns fan and you're trying to tell us how smart you are...
Very true very true.
Interesting, thanks. Not a libertarian personally, but makes sense to me.
Pitches and catchers for yanks and mets 2/13!

If he would've followed up w "how come he didn't donate it to the needy?" it would've been to 5 all time KenM.
I felt that way for years. Marquee Moon was really the only track I knew despite giving the album a few chances. \n\nThen I saw them live a couple years ago and realized how great a lot of the other songs are. Went back and played the album on repeat for days after that. If you get a chance to see them, definitely take it.
At Dinky Donuts.
Wouldn't call him a national leader but he did make headlines right ever Trump was elected when he said he'd delete the city's lists of known illegal immigrants if he were asked to turn them over.  \n\nMaybe "early vocal opponent" would have been a better way to describe him.
We Can!
Yet they are all Trump's ideas.  They care more about delivery than content.
I always get downvotes when I insinuate that no one in finance, at the time of the occupy movement, cared or even thought about what was going on down in Zuccotti. I was there, in the Park, and I was there at my job on the 24th floor of a high rise on Park Ave surrounded by the very people the movement set out to upset. I was a lackey piker, but I was there, witnessing the reactions to what was going on, first hand.\n\nThe Occupy movement failed, in my opinion. No platform, no real message, and not one a ruffled feather among the people the movement was trying to scare.\n\nThis is not a bullshit rightwing talking point. This is the reality of the finance industry's response to Occupy. Everyone has the capacity to say "well they're not talking about ME."  And in the unlikely event any finance bro even associated Occupy with themselves, they exorcised that ability.\n\nNot everyone who's in the evil 1% by wealth, or the evil 1% by income has bad intentions. But none of the bad ones cared then, and none of them care now. Occupy changed zero, or close to zero, hearts and minds, despite whatever nostalgic, heroic, narrative people want to attach to it.\n\nAnd I don't say as as someone who believes we should stop fighting. I just think that Occupy was as waste of energy, and I want us to do better.
The article you linked to talks about how Obama got the location wrong, but how his uncle did, in fact, help to liberate a concentration camp. \n\nIdk why you'd link to something that disproves the point you're trying to make.  And anyway, getting facts about an event wrong isn't really the same as making an event up entirely out of thin air.
GOOD point.
Idk if it's still true, but at the time of the Occupy movement, I remember the largest portion of the individuals that constitute the 1% were actually medical professionals.\n\nNot to say that doctors and surgeons are or are not overpaid. I can't really speak to that. And I think many of the top financial firm higher ups are certainly overpaid (worked in finance for a number of years, don't any more).  But I remember thinking it was kinda funny that it was Occupy Wall St and not Occupy ERs/doctors offices when docs were the biggest share of the group being vilified.
Constructive.
Oh I know. Wasn't implying it was. What's your point?\n\nI'm a liberal-leaning independent btw. You want to protest income and/or wealth inequality, I'm behind you 100%. I just thought the idea of blanket-vilifying "the 1%" was kind of misguided. Not all wealthy people are villains. Just look at ER surgeons, for example.
520 POUNDS? Jesus H. Montero.
Right. And that's what the response invariably is whenever I ask this question. Voter ID laws are racist. At the same time, I can walk 10 minutes to an ID place in Brooklyn and get one mailed to me in 2 weeks. In Jersey they print them on the spot.\n\nCan you give me an idea of just how difficult it is to get an ID in other parts of the country? Because I stand against voter ID laws, but I still don't really understand why getting an ID is so difficult for so many people.
It's a bit odd and off-puttin' to pray to a baby...
The guy in the comments talking about James Bond weirded me out more than YouTube comments usually do for some reason.
Well that was a blast from the past. Expected to watch the first couple minutes and sat thru the whole thing. The encyclopedia prize made me laugh.
From New York. Can't decide if I wanna steal this and change it to a Long Island girl or a Jersey girl. Depends on the audience I guess.

Seriously who was that?
They used to have problems like this in hockey where guys using the inside of their skate to stop pucks were leading to fractured foot bones. Couple years ago some dudes in the Flyers organization created some kind of inside foot plate to help mitigate that type of injury. \n\nHow have they not developed some kind of super strong layer inside cleats so foul-ball-off-foot doesn't become 6-weeks-on-DL? Obviously easier said than done, but it seems like something that we should be able to get done in 2017, no?
Sean Penn went full retard. Walked away empty-handed.
Dude so dumb he can't even figure out how to screw up a hockey team.
He had that famous exchange with a journalist where he said (paraphrasing) the press doesn't make him angry bc you can't be angry at someone you don't respect.
My gramps was a cop back in 70s and 80s New York and told me a story about a woman arrested for prostitution who had been abandoned at birth and, as a result, had been given the name Female Jones.\n\nShe pronounced it like tamale.
Well yeah, surely. Just surprised bc that's not a common rationale for being pro-sanctuary city. Personally, I'm anti-mass deportment while being pro-immigration reform in the form of an easier path to citizenship. \n\nIf there aren't people here working under the table and, as a result, being treated as second class citizens in terms of wages and rights, I think the social ecosystem in our city will benefit. To be anti-mass deportment for the sake of your guns is just a connection I hadn't made.
Not that you asked or anything, but I recently looked up the history of the term "Golden Sombrero." It came to mean 4 strike outs bc a hat trick is 3, so 4 Ks requires a bigger hat.\n\nMaybe that was obvious to everybody, but I had an "oh, duh" moment.
I DECLARE BANKRUPTCY.
Looks like we got a clock-wisenheimer over here.
This is the same guy who complained about having a defective microphone during the debates, right?

One one hand I hope this is true. If Trump himself isn't going to read the briefings, and they're just going to be shared with members of his team with unclear prerogatives, it's for the best the IC keeps things closer to the vest.\n\nOn the other hand I hate the precedent this sets. Trump supporters want him to drain the swamp, burn it down and start over. In reality, one man can't do that. What's more likely is that the different branches of bureaucracy will just go into their shells and wait it out.
Thanks for your response. Is there any kind of grassroots solution to this? Mobile ID printing vehicles or something? Or are we really just waiting on the Supreme Court to classify this kind of legislation wholly unconstitutional?
Met Har Mar in the St. Vitus bathroom once. Cant confirm how clean it is, but it was definitely sexy.
Since you replied directly to me, I've read your response a bunch of times today and I'm still trying to work out where you stand. Are you pro-sanctuary city AND pro-gun?\n\nBecause it seems like you're saying that di Blasio shouldn't hand over the illegal citizen registry to the Trump administration because that would then expose registered gun owners to similar federal requests in the future.
The article doesn't really say that. It's an analysis of a particular subset of Trump voters. It's not arguing that 4chan won the election for Trump. \n\nIt's breaking down the pathology of the 4chan users who supported Trump and speculating as to why they voted the way they did.\n\nPretty interesting really. Worth a read.

What can be done to encourage non-white voters to obtain IDs? This article says, "this is a solution in search of a problem" and in the context of voter fraud that's true. \n\nBut as it pertains to progressives it's sort of disingenuous.  Voter ID laws ARE OUR problem now. To get principled and say "this is racist, not doing it" is all well and good. But if everyone had easy access to IDs, wouldn't this point he moot?\n\nIs anyone trying to make easily accessible IDs for all who want them a reality?
😉👍
I'm by all conservative accounts a liberal snowflake cuck shill (I'm a registered independent who voted for Hillary) but I will point out that he hasn't taken away my health insurance YET. \n\nI know this is a post in politicalhumor, but if you're gonna blast a guy and his supporters with facts, I'd encourage people to make sure they're true.
Didn't Valerie just move into Obamas house in DC too? \n\nThe Wash Post recently hired John Podesta.  I wonder how he will spin his own scandals. \n\nThe msm is a globalist propaganda machine.
I think the last one I got was maybe $18? And yes I've been outside of Brooklyn. I'm really not trying to be combative here. I just happened to have gotten an ID when I was 16 like just about everyone else I was in school with at the time. I don't have a car, so it's not like I needed a drivers license. It was just what you did.\n\nI'm uninformed about ID culture in other parts of the county and asking to be enlightened. From this one human's experience, obtaining an ID was neither difficult nor expensive. I keep it up to date so I can get into bars...

They do it so they can start 401ks for their kids and make annual tax-deferred contributions. Saves the business owner probably somewhere around $7-8k a year (per kid!) in taxes if they max out and all they have to do is put their kid in the ad for a second.
This whole stunt today just makes me even more curious as to the real reasoning is behind Oak and Dolan's bad blood. Dolan is a douchebag, but he clearly doesn't have beef with every former Knick. Why does he with Oak?
Yeah, I know.\n\nRicky: (continuing) Dear tiny, infant Jesus... \n\nCarley: Hey, you know, sweetie, Jesus did grow up. You don’t always have to call him “baby.” It’s a bit odd and off-putting to pray to a baby.

"So I was at my brothers house party with my wife's sisters friend."  \n\nThis is starting to sound like your fault.\n\n(P.s. I'm kidding)
Priebus isn't chairman of the RNC anymore.  Trump needs to get these people in line, not so much Priebus. 
Thanks for posting this.  Very interesting but not even shocking anymore.  A takeover of the Middle East (except Saudi of course) pre planned.  They just needed to create reasons for it; whether retaliation (Iraq-9/11) or humanitarian (Libya and Syria-the people were better off before being invaded) to make it happen.   In the process they created ISIS, the massive immigration problem and hundreds of thousands of people died.  For what?\n\nSo despicable.   These people, like Cheney and Hillary Clinton, still have tremenous power now.
Russia also paid Bill Clinton $500,000 for just one speech.\nhttp://www.breitbart.com/2016-presidential-race/2016/07/25/flashback-clintons-loved-russia-enough-sell-uranium/
James OKeefe says it is Robert Krammer behind it.  Krammer was in OKeefes earlier videos exposed as a democratic operative who pays people to wreck havoc at Trump rallys.\n\nEdit: Creamer not Krammer
Hillary still has plenty of power. She is closely connected to the Deep State. 
Absolutely.  The people over party.  There are opportunist corrupt globalists on both sides.  They are sadly the majority it seems. 
That's not the only reason.  However Trump has already brought back tens thousands of jobs from companies that are pledging to come back to or remain in the US.   Small businesses are again thriving because of the much needed tax breaks.\n\nThis growing optimism is helping the stock market in a meaningful way.   It was supposed to crash with a Trump presidency after being held at an artificial high by Obama.
What breed of dog is he?  He has a very unique look, like a dingo mix.  Lucky you! \n\nEdit:  Not dingo.  Not sure what I was thinking. 
I have read it forever and always loved it.  I now get my subscription for free from RecycleBank.  I wouldn't pay for a subscription anymore.
Did you go to the inauguration?
It is Weiner's laptop with Clinton's emails on it, forwarded there by Huma.  Huma saved copies of Clintons emails.   \n\nSounds like they are rightly concerned about these emails.  I wonder how many people they will take down.  
He should be.  Could his friendship with the DC Chief of Police be the reason he isn't?
It is all in the spin.   The entire MSM is well adapted at it. \n\nPeople magazine is also full of liberal propaganda.  I subscribe to it and skip over all political bs stories.   They ruin the magazine.\n\n
They are also funded by George Soros.
Shills are heavily in this sub due to the pedogate talk.
The Daily Caller is just like any other source posted here. HuffPo, DailyBeast, Slate, etc are all heavily left wing propaganda.  No beef about them though?\n\nI also gave you the Washington Post which reported Obama attended as little as 38% of his briefings.  Jeez.\n\nThe msm wouldn't dare report anything negative against Obama unless it was obvious.   \nThere are hardly any real journalists these days. \n\nEdit: I am on a phone.  I know I have seen other sources besides the daily caller but it is hard to find with manipulated Google searches.\nIt will only get downvoted anyways.  Can't criticize Obama, only Trump.
They will defend it by saying they were looking out for the security and protection of the general public to ensure Russia wasn't controlling the election.    They were doing it for the people dammit!   They are heroes. /s\n\nThis is how they defended Flynn's calls with the Russian Ambassador being leaked to the press.
Racism charges already happened before and during the confirmation hearings.  That didn't work but they desperately tried. 
It would have to be a mini-series.  Too much corruption to fit into a single movie.  
Reagan was shot a few months into his first term.
Use their playbook against them.
Sessions answer is in regards to his own communication with the Russian ambassador specifically in relation to the Trump campaign.   He didn't speak to them about the campaign.  Sessions interpreted the question as talking about the campaign.  If it was unclear, Franken should have asked him a follow-up question.\n\nIMO it is semantics and splitting hairs.     
Money well spent.
Which was Obama's Libya.  Neither should have been invaded.  We were lied to about both.
I wouldn't be surprised if Mr. Khan, from the DNC convention, was an invited guest of someone like Schumer.  He will probably hold up his pocket constitution too. 
Me too.  He is up against so much pure evil and greed.
I hope he is as tough on them as he is on illegal immigrants.   Actually much tougher as they have done so much worse.   No one should be above the law.   
The deep state has been in existence for decades, they aren't going anywhere.  
And this R....Child post was removed proving your point.
This is good for Trump.   As much as people hate Bush, if he came out proTrump it would be terrible.  
Loretta Lynch never recused herself from the Hillary email investigation despite her close relationship with both Clintons. \n\nThey only care about conflicts of interest if it involves their opponents. 
As a result he has been silenced.
Ex CIA director George Tenent said there were weapons of mass destruction in Iraq resulting in thousands of American soldiers and hundreds of thousands of Iraqis killed.  He knew this info wasnt true.\n\nIt doesn't seem impossible that Dar Adal would orchestrate a false flag attack where a minimal amount of people died, 2?, to advance his agenda/cause.    I also don't think it is him because it is too obvious.    
Just like McCain and Obama.  Both are puppets of the deep state.  McCain would have been worse.
He also isn't a lifelong politician who would have crafted his returns knowing they would be open to public scrutiny.  If he was he might have made different investments or gave more to certain charities.  He might have used them to put on a false front like the Clintons. \n\nHe was a businessman who didn't agree with how the government was spending his tax dollars.  He probably paid as little as legally possible as any smart person would.  He also made tax decisions most beneficial to his companies and shareholders.
I wonder if he can realistically move to a different platform.  Not sure if gab.ai is good, but if Trump moves, his followers will go with him and Twitter will be destroyed. \n\nEdit:  Not destroy, but seriously fracture.  Twitter needs competition that treats users fairly and equally.   The manipulation is obvious. 
Is your cat bigger than your dog?\n :-)
Exactly.  Just like Hillary's wallstreet speeches.
They aren't accepting jack.  They had two big recent wins, General Flynn resigning and Milo being labeled pedo friendly (wrongly).   
These are only the meetings/calls she tweeted about.  There are likely more.
Very.
The dog looks like his owner in the first pic.
Obama is the one orchestrating the town hall protestors and their tactics.  The media then focuses only on the disruptions.
And Trump outwitted him \n\n> Seven days before he left office, **President Obama changed the order of succession without explanation to remove Boente from the list.** Obama's order had listed U.S. attorneys in the District of Columbia, the Northern District of Illinois and the Central District of California.\n\n..\n\n>That seems like awfully suspicious behavior. In fact the USA Today story noted this is pegged to the news that **Trump quietly signed an executive order restoring Boente to the line of succession.**\n\n..\n >The Obama administration chicanery was likely brought to White House's attention after Obama holdover and acting Attorney General Sally Yates tried to usurp the powers of the president and countermand his immigration executive order, actions for which she was summarily fired.        
Excellent compilation.   
What the Obama Cartel has done to Trump is MUCH worse than Watergate.  Watergate is JV.
That is a cat-dog.  More dog than cat even.
To point out blatant hypocrisy as the msm won't question most lies the dems say.
They got what they wanted.  Milo lost his place as the CPAC keynote speaker, lost his book deal and resigned from Breitbart.  They think they've won and they're moving on to their next target.\n\nThey think he is irrelevant/ineffective now but will bring it up as necessary if he continues to succeed.\nHe needs support more now than ever.  
Hardly any foreign countries wanted to hear him speak until Hillary became Sec. of State.  Then his speaking rates doubled, tripled and quadrupled. \n\nEdit- Clinton Cash Official Film,  Director's Cut:\nhttps://youtu.be/7Xd0bicaY64    
It is a twitter post.  The serious crime is real, the Starbucks line is a joke.  Why focus on the joke and not the horrific murder of the boy for listening to music?  \nAnn was joking about Starbucks recent hiring policies.  They also segregate or don't allow women in many of their Middle Eastern stores.  Intolerant practices.   \n\nEdit: ISIS has been known to hide amidst refugees. That is her joke.
Don't rifle squad them, expose them to the public.  Lay out all their crimes and let that be their legacy.  Why are they (especially Clinton) above the law? 
Great name!
I highly doubt he reads responses.  He likely only reads tweets from the few people he follows.
He did specify he had no contact with Russia regarding Trumps campaign.  The Washington Post edited Franken's question.  Franken specifically asked him about the campaign.\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/dfCIjIa.png\n\nSessions probably removed himself because he would be the focus by the press instead of the actual investigation.  It is a wild goose chase.   This works in his favor, (and the country's) as he has real issues to focus on and now has more time to do so.     \n\nEdit-clarity.  
Pepe the Builder.
Thanks!  The original post is gone.
Who is he?
Perfect!
It's telling that people can't distinguish a joke from the truth these days, especially when it involves murder and Islam.  It all seems to blend together.  Truth is often stranger than fiction.\n\nThe MSM tries to spin every story negatively against Trump.  I have never seen anything so misleading and despicable as the MSM news coverage.  Talk about cherry picking to control the narrative. That is what you should be outraged about and not a Trump support sub on reddit.       
It is a support sub, so what.  Every candidate had one.   His support has only grown since the election.  What is wrong with having ONE large sub proTrump when there are dozens specifically against him; even ones that claim to be neutral like politics? \n\nAs far as shilling, you do mean the antiTrump people right?  CTR is now ShareBlue.  
They justify their free dresses and "swag" as rightful because of all the free publicity/advertising they will bring the company by wearing and using their products.   
Valerie even moved into Obama's DC residence last month.\nhttp://www.zerohedge.com/news/2017-03-02/valerie-jarrett-moves-obamas-dc-lead-fight-strategy-topple-trump \n\nI didn't know she also lived in the whitehouse with the Obamas.
I listened to a little bit of his show today.   Rush said that during the Senate confirmation hearings for Sessions, that Sessions agreed to recuse himself from any prosecution of Hillary Clinton, her emails and the Clinton Foundation.  WHAT??? My jaw dropped.  Did I hear him wrong?\n\nHow could he agree to recuse himself from potentially one of the \nbiggest scandals and most corrupt individuals and corporations(CF) in history??   That is one of the major reasons I personally wanted Sessins as AG.  I hope to God this is wrong.
I don't think he's running it but he is knee deep in it.  Hillary may very well be running it.  Or Dick Cheney?
That would be a bad move so they'll probably do it.
It still happened recently, not ancient times.   People get stoned in the streets and thrown off buildings simply for being gay.  Women are second class citizens in these countries.  Yet Trump is the one suppressing people's rights? Far from it.   These countries leaders also largely supported Clinton.  Did she disown their support and return their millions? Ha \n\nEven the people complaining about Ann's tweet are incensed by her Starbucks joke instead of being outraged by the murder.
Bannon and Conway are most trustworthy, imo.  Just look at who the media attacks most and wants out. (Sessions too)
He had to continually fake smile as he was in the spotlight.
It all leads back to Obama and his shadiw government.  Bob Creamer is the DNC stooge who visited the white house hundreds of times and Obama personally dozens. \n\nEdit *shadow 
You do remember last summer where Obama was out on a golf course while LA flooded?  Jeh Jonson said something like Obama doesn't need briefings because he is so smart. Right.   That's probably why he called ISIS the JV team.\n\nObama missed more than HALF his briefings in his first term.   \n\nFrom article above:\n>This coming from the same person(Obama) who skipped more than half of his daily intelligence briefings in his first term. As I reported in this space in 2012, during his first 1,225 days in office, Obama attended his daily meeting to discuss the PDB just 536 times — an attendance record of 43.8 percent. In 2011 and the first half of 2012, his attendance dropped even lower, to just over 38 percent of the time.  
Now Sessions has time to focus on actual crimes and corruption instead of wasting his valuable time on Russia.   He needs to start digging into the 650000 emails on Weiners laptop containing state dept info. and Clinton Foundation crimes.\n\nHowever the democrats will say anyone he goes after was done in retaliation.  So let them investigate Russia and the Trump campaign thoroughly and clear Sessions, but don't let them drag it on forever. \n\n As others have said, we need to go on the offense.  Where is the investigation into Saudi Arabia, Mexico, Germany and Ukraine?  They interfered more than Russia in our election.
Id rather see him exposed, knocked off his golden pedestal and brought to justice. 
Trump should have handled it internally, imo.  Flynn was someone who had Trump's back and was with him from the beginning.  Trump has very few people he can unconditionally trust. \n\nThe real question is why the people listening to the Russian Ambassador didn't stop when they heard Flynn's voice.  More so who the hell criminally leaked it to the media.
It isn't obvious to everyone.  Trump points it out as the MSM won't cover this angle.\nPeople will unite against a rigged system.  The DNC needs change not another establishment puppet, Perez.  It is still Obama and Clinton calling the shots.  
So much info in one post.   Pence is suspicious.   I don't think Flynn should have been asked to resign and it seems as though Pence was behind it.  \nHe is also a globalist and pro the former TPP.
Sessions agreed to recuse himself from the Hillary email investigation during his Senate confirmation hearings.  I wish he hadn't done this.   Don't give them an inch because it will never end.
Great points, especially your last one.
Scary image.
Who is Moon Beam?  Jerry Brown?
Not really.  They report stories the MSM wont touch because they go against their (the msm's) narrative.\nThe DM has posted many articles on Wikileaks, Seth Rich, crimes committed by refugees in Europe, extensive terrorist attack coverage, racial hate crimes(all races), etc. that the MSM won't or hardly covers.\n\nDuring the election they were "courageous" enough to actually report negative Clinton articles and pro-Trump ones.  They didn't get their propaganda talking points from the Clinton campaign.  Refreshing.  
It has long been strongly rumored that Campbell Brown ended up with tape.  She formerly worked for NBC and CNN.  Her husband is Never Trumper, Dan Senor, a top advisor to Romney and Ryan.\nHe leaked it to WaPo early.\n\nCampbell now heads Facebooks Fake News division.  She helps to decide what is or isn't fake. 
Dont say that.
She did an Alex Jones interview in 2007.  Interesting.  Her years long local vice case became a federal FBI case when she closed her escort business.  The intelligence agencies were allegedly spying on her powerful DC clients when they used her escort service, unbeknownst to Debra.\n\nOne of her escorts allegedly hung herself.   She was a college professor and was fighting her case.  She said she planned to expose her clients as she didn't think her case was fair.   Then she was found dead.\n\nThe same thing happened to Debra Jean Palfrey, the madam.  She was found hung.  She was fighting her case and told friends she would never commit suicide and she thought she was being followed.  She also told Alex Jones she couldn't be bought off, wouldn't make a deal and would never commit suicide.  She wanted to know why the government was going after her and demanded answers.  She also planned to write a book.  She even made sure her condo fees were prepaid in anticipation of her upcoming 6 yr prison sentence.\n\nDebra also had released her client list to ABC News.  They strangely spiked their story saying the names weren't newsworthy enough.  The names were sealed instead of being prosecuted.  Who was on the list?\nAccording to sources, DICK CHENEY, John McCain, Fred Thompson and Rudi Guiliani were on the list.   Her escort service was being used as bait to entrap people by the US government.\n\nShe knew too much.\n\n     
He did his time, he can do what he wants.  But again it shows a lack of judgment by the leftist elites.  Much worse was Omar Mateen's (the Orlando Pulse nightclub mass murderer) father sitting front and center behind Hillary Clinton at a rally in Orlando a short time after the massacre.  He said he was an invited guest.
The leaks have been rumored to come from Priebus.   If there is even a question, he needs to go.   
He is absolutely correct.
Yes I did.  Obama missed more than half his briefings in his first term and this escalated to only attending 30% of them as his presidency continued.\n\nAnother source:\n\nhttp://dailycaller.com/2014/09/30/obama-has-spent-more-time-playing-golf-than-in-intel-briefings/ \n\n> The Daily Caller has calculated that he’s spent almost 700 hours in 875 “Presidential Daily Briefings” since 2009.\n\n>But he’s also spent roughly 800 hours on almost 200 golf trips since his first inauguration.\n\n\nWhy are you so adamantly defending Obama on this?  Neither one should have missed or continue to miss briefings.
Rupert Murdoch's sons.
Yes.  He also had all the other big media outlets fawning over him.  Obama couldn't even take criticism from just one outlet. 
Try it.   You can buy chocolate peanut butter too.\n\nHave you ever tried Reeses Peanut Butter Cups?
Exactly.  No paid protesters will be at this Town Hall.
It is absolutely awful.  If it is trying to be funny, its not.  If it is trying to be serious, it is idiotic.   
Obama did the same and worse.\n\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/obamas-hypocrisy-on-intelligence-briefings/2016/12/19/8b1fbed0-c5f4-11e6-bf4b-2c064d32a4bf_story.html?utm_term=.cadc8613599b\n 
Sibel Edmonds story is really fascinating.  Her podcasts are great.   
They never pay attention to the follow up stories though.  They hear all these bad things and assume it's Trumps fault and move on. \n\nHow much did you hear about the black guy who spray painted Trump on the side of the church and then burned it down? 
>Thompson is suspected of being a copycat – of hearing about the JCC phone calls and then conducting his own campaign of phone terrorism. According to the FBI, Thompson dated a Jewish woman; after their relationship ended, he sent defamatory emails and faxes to the woman’s employer. He then stalked her. After that, he made “at least eight JCC Threats nationwide as part of his campaign” against his ex-girlfriend. He then tried to blame the woman in order to have her prosecuted; \n\nGlad they caught this copycat who was trying to frame his ex girlfriend.  \n\nHopefully they can also figure out the 100 remaining bomb threats and also who vandalized the Jewish cemeteries in St Louis and Philadelphia.
They don't have time or the privilege to see people as individuals. That's what this cultural marxist class/race/gender/sexual preference warfare will do to you.  
They made up the term and it was turned around on them in 5 seconds.  It's glorious.  
I love when their narrative gets destroyed time and time again
Good ole left wing logic.  Trump may be hugely pro-Israel and his son-in-law may be a the grandchild of a Holocaust survivor, but some people who opted for him rather than HRC are vaguely like Nazis so Trump must be opposed for his antisemitism.  
And he is still anti Semitic by choosing to further victimize Jewish organizations. 
>  who vandalized the Jewish cemeteries in St Louis and Philadelphia\n\nprobably an agitprop campaign by some activist group, like nearly all supposed hate crimes in past 6 months turned out to be fake\n\nEspecially with Trump being massively pro-israel, i fail to see it as a hate crime. \n\nThe samage is done however, doesnt matter if people get caught, MSM besides fox wont report that it was a false flag. Just remember James O'keefe has video proof of democrats planning false flag attacks in past. 
Can we all appreciate how badly the blaming of fake news for trump turned out for the media? \n\nIts just keeps paying dividends. 
I had an argument with my mother over this.  I was at her house a few days ago watching the nightly news about this story and she asked my dad\n\n "why are these Trump supporters targeting Jews?" \n\nI interjected and said \n\n"why are you assuming they are Trump supporters? "\n\nAnd she got all triggered. I can't wait to send this to her tomorrow morning. 
Turns out the last 100 years of left-wing anti-semitism wasn't an anomaly.
He's still a leftist that found it reasonable to take revenge on his ex by making bomb threats.\n
Please just read their playbook.  "By any means necessary."  Neither truth or logic is required because we are all going to wind up in the fairy tale state where we are all millionaires regardless of our education or work ethic.
Yup and I was referring to his song with Kehlani

Beyonce had to cancel because she will be 7 months pregnant with twins
FIRST THE GRAMMYS THEN COACHELLA
They had it prepared long before. They recognized him right before the video

You're right. Boyhood was fantastic
La La Land is the best film I've seen in a long time. 
I started crying from laughter during grogs rage over ale
Damn good speech
The last 2 times coachella has had to do a late replacement, they replaced The Who with Jay Z and Black Sabbath with Dre and Snoop Dogg. And the rumor is NIN and Frank Ocean to replace her. So they don't need to replace her with a pop act.
I don't think people will be ready for how insane that crowd/set will be
Denzel could definitely take it. Gosling has a chance but not much
There's been about 6 or so

I hope both the democrats and republicans that voted no last time will vote yes
Please please please let this happen. 
The uproar when he quoted the bible was hilarious. If it was the Quran he would be "brave"
The problem would have been Japan. The US basically beat Japan by itself. What would have happened if Japan was able to easily join the Axis. It took the force of the US, Russia and Britain to push the Germans back. But without the personnel the US provided I don't think the Allies would have won. But who really knows.
I think so, because Frank Ocean and NIN are headlining Panorama (East coast coachella). So will probably be very similar to that. \n\nAlso coming from london, WOW. Hope you enjoy coachella it is an amazing experience. I hope to make it to the UK one day for glastonbury
I just recently started it, currently on Episode 11 (5 1/2 hour episode) during their fight with Ke'Varn. Just jump back to where you left off and keep going. Their roleplaying is top notch. And also Grog

Dude I just thought of this too. Colonel Cockface has his hands together while taking about the true mastermind and very subtly does /\\ \n\nWould be too perfect
100% deserved. The score of the movie was top fuckin notch
I hope so, because I was really upset they werent gonna be in norcal
He could go. In the letter said he chose not to go
If this fight is cancelled I'm going to be so upset. It was the best fight in a long time on paper
/u/benedictcumberpatch has accurately said the headliners for the last few years.
Lil Uzi Vert\n\nThat's not rap that's trash
B+
Alcantara makes weight at least
Radiohead and NIN in the same weekend would honestly be almost too much to handle (in a good way)
The forest part
Just reading through your comments, this was never meant to be a conversation. Basically you just want to tell conservatives they're wrong. You seem to be incredibly close minded and believing "ALL CONSERVATIVES LOVE THE RICH AND ARE EVIL BECAUSE RICH = EVIL"
Trump talks about wanting to help veterans\n\nInstead of supporting veterans /r/politics attack Trump on the fact he didn't serve
Oh my lanta. I unfortunately did not get to attend my first festival until 2015. 
I would guess so since that was something Bernie was incredibly passionate about
Maia going to Maia 
It's up there with the Jerry Lawler/Andy Kaufman fued
That's what we were thinking, thank you! 
I mean she is playing 2018
/r/politics was making comparisons the whole time lol\n\nThey say VOICE is the new SS
Senator Warren looked so pissy
Read the context and the wording of what he was asked and what he answered. Not a lie\n
Yea, Lincoln was the first republican president. There were democratic-republicans before that but Lincoln was the very first Republican president
Wasn't going to see Beyonce. But now i will see Lady Gaga\n\nDefinitely happy\n\nStill wish it could have been NIN but I'll take gaga
Very happy about this, I wasn't going to see Beyonce regardless so no matter who replaces her is a plus
WOOOOOOOO DAMIEN CHAZELLE!!!!

They were in the tribute last year
We accept the love we think we deserve
La La Land had some of the best cinematography I have ever seen in a movie
Who is the one other than Emma Stone?
Never said it was appealing to me just said what /r/politics was saying about it.\n\nI'm going to wait for results
Stormzy is my 2nd most anticipated rap artist (other than kendrick)
Except Michael Cera
Happy with this, I wasn't going to see Beyonce no matter what. Now I will go see at least most of Lady Gaga
lol
La La Land is starting to steamroll and I love it

There is no reason for the investigation though.  Was Hillary wire tapped?  She's had plenty of conversations and deals with Russia. \n\nThis is the Democratic party trying to undermine our democracy.

Because it's true.  Elizabeth Warren is not Native American and she offended me by claiming that she was for political gain.  Or is it only the "tolerant" left that is allowed to be offended? 
That's racist I think.
Did you just assume that there are ONLY two genders? 
I had a friend from high school over right after the election that I hadn't seen in a long time.  Turns out he was working for Hillary's campaign down in DC.  I asked him specifically what he did and his answer, I kid you not, was "html stuff".  He wouldn't say much more than that but I started making fun of him and he left.  \n\nEdit: And yeah he did think he was on the right side of history.  He said he could not understand why I support Trump because he didn't believe I was a "bad person" or a "racist".  He also brought up the pussy grabbing narrative to show how Trump was unfit and I told him that he was acting like a beta male bitch.

So would you say that the glbt community isn't very providing the same sense of community to trans people as glb people? I'm not sure what you are saying in the second paragraph. I don't hear trans people beating on straight people for being bigoted but it does, to me, seem that glbt activist, for lack of a better word, beat on anti trans bigotry as much as anti homosexual bigotry. Do you disagree?
Trump says that if we can build the wall and deport criminal illegal aliens, then he'll grant amnesty to non criminal illegal aliens. Does that make compromising on the wall worth it, despite it not being what you voted for?
Haha you got me.

Once again you're making pointless attacks that do nothing to support your arguments, to help the people you care about, or even to argue against me. I don't support milo or trump, but I haven't said so because that is all besides the point. I can clearly see  that you only have the mental ability to argue against shit you're pulling out of your ass. So go ahead and show me how you've shit yourself again. \n 
We started talking because you said everyone goes to college and I said that wasn't true. 
Because it's part of our heritage and many people, especially powerful people, see that past as something that needs to be destroyed, or at least controlled, for the sake of progress. Christian organizations, churches and otherwise, don't want to be required to be forced to do things that conflict against their faith by the threat of the state. This can apply to making Christian organizations provide birth control, requiring Californian Christian College organizations to promote glbt people as their student leaders, making Christians who run small business perform services that conflict with their faith, or the state making it too expensive to send your kids to a Christian school.
But they are just under privileged youths? /s

Really highlights why our immigration system is not designed for illegal immigration and what the difference is between a legal and an illegal immigrant. 
No one is asking you to suck Donald Trump's dick. 
Are you saying you don't want to grant amnesty to non-criminal illegal immigrants for the sake of money? What I asked you was, would building a wall and deporting criminal illegal aliens be worth it if we could compromise with Trump to grant non-criminal illegal aliens citizenship? As some one who was with her, I think so, despite, as you say, the considerable profit we make off them. I believe, we need to grant non-criminal illegal aliens citizenship to the republic and we need to find a compromise to do so.   \n\nEdit: even if it means wasting a tiny fraction of our massive spending on a wall I don't want. I'm not going to tell the good, hard working, and law abiding non-documented immigrants that are part of this nations that they'll just have to wait 8 years because I don't want a wall.  
Yes and no. The 14th is more about protecting civil rights through equal protection under the law. That certainly includes the right to property, compensation for work, and freedom of movement though. 
You compared my sexual history to milo. That is disparaging my sexual history. Can you showing me that I continued to say that Shaun King called his mother a whore after I read the primary source or even one time where I said that his mother was a whore rather than shaun king said his mother was a whore? 
If I might just say, you are playing into their game. What Americans call classical liberalism is what Europeans call liberalism. I think it's because their leftist historically have been more pronounced and haven't taken on the word liberal.

Okay I'm done feeding the troll, don't bother responding unless you are willing to defend your accusations because I'm not learning anything from you brother. 
Fun fact, the message on the statue of liberty always referred to legal immigration. 
If you combine drunk driving with illegal immigration, is that an issue for the Federal government? Once again, the issue isn't that the state law enforcement wasn't prosecuting the drunk driver, but that the judge allegedly helped the drunk driver physically escape federal agents and thus prevented them from doing their job.  
Then pray that you can contribute to the need for unity. 
All three of them? Not arguing, just clarifying. 
Maybe we should have stricter controls on urban cats. 
Cute. 
Haha okay. 
If you think everyone has a college degree, yes. 
I'm going to be an ass hole to people that rationally defend Trump in a discussion, regardless of the subject! And then punch a trash can. 
How does any of that support your claim that "everyone gets a college degree." Yes, it isn't too hard to get into a college and to get loans for it, but one reason many people don't go to college is because having a degree is not as valuable as it use to and they don't think they'll be able to find a good enough job to make the loans worth it. 
Which is why they are using his comments to back up their views. He's obviously not just touting the party line. 
How so? I missed it. 
SAFTEY! SAFTEY! SAFTEY! SAFTEY!
No one is taking this as gospel, but it does tell you something about the public response considering its coming from a station that doesn't like him.      
Everyone in your bubble has a degree. A lot of people don't because of the cost. 
Do you know what Trump and congressional Republicans plan for clean air and water is? This is a sincere question and I don't believe that it has to do with climate change. 
Because you can provide evidence as to why they are wrong instead of using logically fallacies that do nothing to help the situation other than making you feel strong. What do you think you accomplish for minorities by being to lazy to defend them? 
Can you site where I'm saying that? I was criticising him when I believed that he called his mother a whore because I didn't think that was respectable or true to say about her. After I looked up the primary source, I apologized for misquoting him and posted what he said about his mother to clarify what he said and why I was wrong. Why I think you are grasping for straws is because I don't think having sex with a black man makes anyone a whore, I've done the same myself. 
You are acting like a brat by assuming I'm your enemy and you need to insult me. 
Because the world is free and it isn't right for our leader to represent them. Leader of the free world means that we will protect them, but it doesn't need to mean that we will Americanize them. 
Our leftist woukd hate that as they are trying to separate American culture from Europe.

It doesn't add much to hear what Catholics think about self defense? May I ask if you think self defense or protecting someone else is ever acceptable?  
He knew it was a good thing, but Trump would be crucified if he did it. Thanks Obama!
Your reading compression is so bad its to the point of trolling. Did I talk about my sexual history to say I'm not racist or that I don't think having sex with a black man makes you a whore? Did I say that I felt you were disparaging my sexual history by saying I've had interracial sex or by comparing me to milo? I see you are giving up on your argument that I ever called his mother a whore rather than I believed shaun king called his mother a whore. 
I think the wall is a bad idea, but from listening to Trump, I think that is how he will justify granting, or not granting, amnesty to non criminal illegal aliens.  
Yes it's more than disrespect. 
England, France, Russia, and the USA. Sounds like the gang is getting back together and Germany won't be happy. 
Si.  
As a catholic, the bible isn't used the way you view it. We use scripture to inform our tradition and our tradition to inform our reading of scriptures.  The Catholic tradition has a well established theory regarding just war and the appropriate use of violence, including self defense. Would you like some reading material regarding that?  \n\nEdit: "Love toward oneself remains a fundamental principle of morality. Therefore it is legitimate to insist on respect for one’s own right to life."\n\nhttp://www.catholicgentleman.net/2014/01/the-catholic-guide-to-self-defense/\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Just_war_theory?wprov=sfla1\n\n 
Did you know it's chic to say it's racist to call European music from the European Enlightenment, classical music? Or that many schools don't want to read or learn about Thomas Jefferson or William Shakespeare? Or that many people treat Christianity as a slaver religion? Or that you're a white supremacist if you want America to be part of the Anglo-sphere? 
As a catholic, we see it s little differently. \n\n"Love toward oneself remains a fundamental principle of morality. Therefore it is legitimate to insist on respect for one’s own right to life."\n\nhttp://www.catholicgentleman.net/2014/01/the-catholic-guide-to-self-defense/\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Just_war_theory?wprov=sfla1\n\n
Good idea. I responded to the poster with some links in case you're interested. 
Do you think the glbt community is as accepting of trans people as the black community is of black people? 
Be more self aware when you call someone a brat.  
Christ taught to turn the other cheek when someone slaps you. There's a difference between disrespecting someone and seeking to destroy them. For instance, that's why if a woman is being raped, she isn't to just turn the other cheek. \n\n 
>Everyone already does get a degree. It's just expensive AF to pay for, and doesn't have a guaranteed job attached to it.\n\n
Or Russia.

And they should know that committing crimes will make it much harder to wait it out. 
You don't think leftist see conservatives as their enemy?  \n\nEdit: who would even disagree with this statement. 
I wouldnt say that it isn't fair, but that it prevents them from being able to afford to send their kids to the school of their choice. I think what would be more ideal is if all citizen payed for education through taxes and that funding went to families to choose what school they wanted to attend, instead of that tax money just going to public schools.        
Trump is always funny when surfing the web. 
Firstly you have no right to disparage my sexual history and you know that. Secondly I repeated that I believed Shaun King called his mother a whore and I thought that was shameful on his part, not hers, after you challenged me. Thirdly after reading the primary source, I continued to say that Shaun King is claiming his mother had sex with a black man, but that he didn't call her a whore. If you need to apply negative connotations to that, that is your racism to work on. And if you can read, I was arguing that it is unlikely that his mother did have sex with a black man, but I'm guessing that's all over your head right now.   
A lot of politically engaged Americans watch these types of events.   
The first user who responded makes a good point, but I'll add, that families have to pay a good amount of money for public schools in tax that they often don't have the extra money to pay for a private school.  
How was he not arrested when he got the DIU?  What allowed him to live freely despite his actions?
Happy to do it. I learn when I need to find sources to back up my faith. 
Well other than the WSJ. 
The idea is there but you have to struggle to possibly find it. It would of been better to say that historical black colleges shows us what communities can do to create good schools for themselves and that the giving school funding to families will allow communities to come together and create schools that are good for their communities.   
No I don't. Who are you quoting?
As a liberal I'd be inclined to agree, but many leftist feel that trying to reason with them is a micro aggression that is equal to assualt and that that person needs to be delt with sternly and immediately by any means necessary. I don't know how to reason with people like that.  
Say what you will, but that was a big deal when Aristotle essential said that. 
I'm going to teach civics. Any suggestions? 
Can you just tell me what you are proving? Call me a dumbass if you'd like, but it would strength your argument. Because I'm pretty sure you are just arguing that if every libertarians voted for clinton she would of won. 
There's a difference between updating our military equipment, which has become a money pit trying to maintain, and using that equipment to invade other nations. 
And people wonder what Trump means about taking our country back. We can't even prosecut companies that exploit illegal aliens. 
What? I think you need to position your footing relative to your enimies. Leftist see liberalism as bourgeoisie class oppression and individual rights and liberties as a tool of that oppression. I'm actually a liberal, but I see the left becoming more leftists and I want to conserve the basic tenets of liberalism. 
Hey now, some of us are still French.  
You're really gasping for straws. I'm no longer saying he claimed that his mother is a whore because I've read the primary source. And all of your claims are made off of poor assumptions. The reason the last sentence exists is that I can see that you care about these issues, but I can also see you are being counter productive in your efforts. It could be that I'm wasting my time trying to reason with you but I think if I said so I would be dehumanizing you so I'll keep trying to be respectful and reasonable.  
Do you think CNN is trying to mislead it's viewers with this?

I think Trump deserves criticism, but I will say that every president has kept the majority of media outlets from the white house. It's a privilege to be one of the media outlets that have been chosen and CNN and Buzzfeed don't inheritly deserve that privilege. 
vox is pretty far to the left, if you start reading some of their articles, you can see the bias and clickbait that breitbart uses to gather clicks. while vox political commentary is quite factual if biased, their opinion topics (and from their sister site polygon) are what you would expect from a far left progressive website.

I don't think this is devastating proof of media bias. If they kept his claim up without reporting that it had been debunked it would be much worse. If the republicans started actively calling for him to resign from a position because of it i am confident they would report it.
What is the accusation? What is the crime? Meeting with ambassadors or any russian at all isn't a crime
I disagree with a lot of stuff I see on this subreddit, but I also see posts here I wouldn't normally see. With media overload it has become very difficult to maintain accurate information. :/
Oh Jesus \n\nAs a 49ers fan also, I'm so sorry that is your escape 😐
Now you're just being wilfully ignorant. You would make a terrible detective. The 2016 election. The hacks. The train of fake scandal based on far less damning information than this, found within. Sessions was an early supporter. He was questioned under oath at his confirmation hearing and denied any contact.
I look at BBCNews for the disposal of waste paper.
http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2017/03/03/sessions-not-alone-russian-ambassador-also-met-with-numerous-democrats.html
[allsides.com](http://www.allsides.com/) is a site that embraces the "all media is biased perspective," and plots publications on a far left to right scale. Media in the center on their scale, is generally the most reliable.
Throughout the country...

The only point to this article is that journalistic practice typically has them include previous revision errors. Yet in this case they mysteriously disappeared the false information about McCaskill. Nobody is really implying anything else.
They have *zero* professional integrity. They push for whatever makes them the most money, in this case it means providing biased news sources to New Yorkers who are heavily left-leaning already. This way they make more advertisement revenue.
Look in the center on their website for the accusation lol.
The question was if he met with Russians as part of the Trump campaign not in his capacity as a senator, no perjury here.
I said this upthread, but I love the Christian Science Monitor. It's very middle of the road and generally just reports facts. \n\nhttp://www.csmonitor.com/
I believe Sessions lied under oath about ever having contact.  Not sure that anything inappropriate occurred during those contacts.
"In the walls of the cubicle there were three orifices. To the right of the speakwrite, a small pneumatic tube for written messages, to the left, a larger one for newspapers; and in the side wall, within easy reach of Winston's arm, a large oblong slit protected by a wire grating. This last was for the disposal of waste paper. Similar slits existed in thousands or tens of thousands throughout the building, not only in every room but at short intervals in every corridor. For some reason they were nicknamed **memory holes**. When one knew that any document was due for destruction, or even when one saw a scrap of waste paper lying about, it was an automatic action to lift the flap of the nearest memory hole and drop it in, whereupon it would be whirled away on a current of warm air to the enormous furnaces which were hidden somewhere in the recesses of the building." -George Orwell, Nineteen Eighty-Four
Do you even realize you just made an explicit argument that criminal investigations should be politically motivated and not by the quality of the evidence? "Suspects" are the people you investigate, based on reasonable suspicion. You get warrants, you get subpoenas (Subpoenas, or hackers, one or the other), you get people under oath and on the record, and you get to the bottom of things. All these things you have already seen are very reasonable and very plentiful causes of suspicion. This administration is extremely suspicious, and more secretive than any in decades, possibly ever. He wouldn't even release his tax returns. Tax returns are some of the most basic thing a candidate reveals about himself. They've been meeting with Russian officials, he has financial entanglements everywhere, he lies every day, he has a disreputable white supremacist journalist in his security council . . . does he do anything that isn't suspicious?
I'd like to see it as well. \n\nSchumer and Pelosi have repeatedly made these kinds of accusations  with no evidential basis to support them, only "common sense," and "it's obvious." I highly doubt they have anything to say, and if they don't then I think they should be held accountable for slander.
In fact, all 3 tests for perjury (all 3 must be met for conviction) fail on this:\nhttp://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/politics/special/clinton/stories/whreport8.htm
Not a conservative or trump supporter, but this whole thing has me wondering what the role of an ambassador is. Maybe to meet with officials of foreign governments perhaps?\n\nThe only issue i see is apparently everyone forgets about it then in some way or another makes an absolute and false statement and gets called out for it.\n\nSessions should have been less sure of his incorrect answer.  Recusal is a but much but probably justified only because he unintentionally lied and that creates an appearance of conflict. Recusal is specifically to avoid conflicts or the appearance of it, and by all evidence he himself came to the same conclusion. Unfortunate but irrelevant really.\n\nThe dems claiming for no good reason to never have met with the ambassador and bring proven wrong should be laughed out of office. They just undermined their own argument for any penalties against sessions by showing how easy it is to accidentally forget something like this.
Thanks for sharing!  Who would have any idea of these little edits on news articles?  Most of them are simply grammar and clarification edits... but, I could see this being a great source for spotting media shenanigans.
One time I was reading an article with a really bad headline on there and the first line was something about how they just did the headline to draw people in. The article was completely different from the headline lol. 
Perjury is a crime. Bill Clinton got dragged through the mud for less. He wasn't part of an administration that seems to have more and more ties to Russia every single day.
This, is the fundamental problem with Trumpsters...they don't know how to talk straight...man up...don't use ur 4yr old niece as a shield. There's nothing in the text that indicates Sessions can't be held for perjury. If you are hoping to prove that the question was ambiguous...good luck with that. Question was clear and simple and he lied under oath. Show the question/answers and this text to your 4yr old niece, she will teach you how to read it properly without twisting facts.
Slow down, you're freaking out and making mistakes.\n\nOne office visit\n\nOne was in a group setting\n\nThe group may even have included McCaskill . . . It's unclear from what I've read . . I.e. not interesting, because you can't conspire with someone while your political opponents are right there with you. The other one, however, is still mysterious.\n\nThe other still requires explanation.\n\nThere's a chance that it was only Flynn who participated in this whole thing. . . Yeah right. There's a chance that Sessions is merely another beneficiary of it all.  You just need to be honest with yourself as the facts emerge, and take them seriously. 
The last season is really hard to watch. I dropped it there too.
I'm a liberal who reads the NY Times every day. This is pretty disappointing.\n\nFWIW, I think the Sessions lie / misstatement / whatever, as with McCaskil (sp), was just an honest mistake, more "Veep" than "House of Cards." Busy people forget stuff.
I dunno, seems Schumer and co are making actual tangible accusations. So I want to see the supposed evidence.
That's impressive, you couldn't even make it through a single sentence before blatantly contradicting yourself.  Is the irony lost on you, I wonder?
Horse shit.\n\n1. Sessions was clearly asked if he had contact as part of the campaign. He did not. \n\n2. Having a password of "password" is hacking in the loosest possible sense. Also some of the RNC was hacked, but as it turns out their private position is the same as their public. What would those headlines be "Leaked emails prove RNC is truthfully telling you what they want to do" ?\n\n3. Scandals? Like Lying about selling guns to drug cartels? Or meeting the target of an investigation on a tarmac? Confirmed IRS Targeting?\n\n4. What about the 2016 election? That Hillary lost?
The problem is that after admitting they are a liberal paper, the still continue to say they are objective. It's a contradiction.
And they're not even trying to hide it any more. That's even more troubling. 
Standard reason why even as a liberal, I question the fuck out of the NYT. Its like eating that desert you know is bad for you.
It uses a combination of a few methods they describe [here.](http://www.allsides.com/bias/about-bias) It includes community opinion, independent review, self reporting. The community feedback column on the right hand side is useful for seeing the non-normalized opinion and agreement with the ratings.\n\nI agree though and have voted those media outlets as slightly left. More participation from the right wing community could potentially help the rating system in the future, so I encourage y'all to join in and vote if you're interested.
No I am stating that so far there is nothing but innuendo; McCaskill claims of never having a meeting was just more of the same smear campaign, and that the press is hiding the fact she had after crowing about her statement are "facts" that point to this being a big fat nothing.\n\n
There was the whole Spanish American war thing too.  They have been in the business of selling papers from the beginning.\n
One of the first stories I read about the Sessions dust up said something like "We contacted all members of the Senate Armed Service Committee to ask if they had met with the Russian officials in the last year. The ten members that responded said they had not."\n\nI remember thinking, sure, they said they didn't, just like Sessions said he didn't. How many of them are "lying" because they actually did have contact with Russian officials at some point. How many journalists/FBI agents are going to investigate their claims? \n
Why are you defending him? It doesn't even make any sense.
There are dozens of us 49ers fan Conservatives!  Dozens!
The question was whether they had met with the Russian ambassador in 2016. Last I heard, 20 of them said they hadn't and the rest hadn't responded. That doesn't necessarily mean anything either way. Sessions isn't banned from speaking to the Russian ambassador even if his job didn't require it at the time.
Person who is not accused of anything fails to recall details of nothing in particular, misstates past when it could have been a sick burn . . . Yeah Jeff Sessions should be off the hook for 20 minutes while we talk about this. 
I hope she files a wrongful termination suit after providing proof this was approved by higher ups 
I think the information your referring to was disseminated by the media and wikileaks. Some people claim the initial truthful information was exposed by the Russians, but they did not publicize it. The media and wikileaks did that. \n\nDo you think some truths should be repressed because people are unable to understand it or you do not like the country who may have discovered it? Is that really what you think is best for the nation?
And what's the problem with this? 
This is really concerning. The litmus for being a member of "the press" vs a blogger should involve some form of record keeping. \n\nYou see lots of online papers make retraction without making statement. The NYT is supposed to be a paper of record, and as such it should keep a record that's available to look for
Source? 
Other than the fact that Trump is portrayed as utterly incompetent?   Would having an ineffective moron elected to your major rival stand in as sufficient cause for meddling rather than Trump being some kind of Russian plant?  Did the Russians want Trump, specifically, or just not Hillary?  Is there a difference?  Seems to me there's a whole lot of reasonable explainations for the supposed Russian meddling other than "ermagurd Trump is Manchurian candidate!!", which is a rather extraordinary claim and so far, apparently completely baseless.
They meddled with the voters by inundating them with nonsensical irrelevant fake scandal they were not mentally prepared to take in in context. The Russians saw a weak point in the electorate and exploited it, that much is fair and even legal, but in exchange for what? Why would they want a president Trump? There's no sane explanation except for some kind of collusion. 
I see what your saying but I think Brave new world" got reversed, the amount of bs combined with Trump's attitude toward left leaning media outlets has actually caused people to be less apathetic toward politics. At least on the conservative side of things. For the leftists Trump's mere existence is enough to keep them engaged. I absolutely agree with you that "Brave New World" was the direction we were headed in, but that changed with Trump's election.
Yup exaggerations and lies 24/7 how people are so dumb they don't see it is beyond me. Even Fox is biased trash most of the time
There is evidence of two contacts with Russian ambassadors during the time he was questioned about. One was an office visit, the other was in a group setting with other senators.
Used to get WSJ free at work. Then used the paywall bypass (simply type the article on google in incognito mode). Does not work anymore. 
We have always been at war with Eastasia.
How sad that a bastion of journalism in this country has devolved into such fake-news-fucktardery.
[Bullshit detector RN](http://www.marriagegeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/bullshit.jpg)
This is incorrect.  Franken wasn't asking if Sessions met with anyone.\n\n>"Now, again, I'm telling you this as it's coming out, so you know. But if it's true, it's obviously extremely serious and if there is any evidence that anyone affiliated with the Trump campaign communicated with the Russian government in the course of this campaign, what will you do?"\n\nTo which Sesssions responded:\n\n>"Senator Franken, I'm not aware of any of those activities. I have been called a surrogate at a time or two in that campaign and I didn't have — did not have communications with the Russians, and I'm unable to comment on it."\n\nSo he responded to a general question with a specific denial that was false.  Whether that rises to perjury, I don't know.  But let's get the facts right.
Lol that might be the best suggestion to come back with. Watch the teachers drop all support of this topic as soon as you propose making them share the bathroom with a student.
"Whoever controls the past controls the future" anyone else wondering why 1984 has become a play book when it was meant to be a warning? Luckily for us the internet is still written in ink. 
Accusing someone of something doesn't mean we should give a crap. There's no evidence for the accusation lol
My 4 year old niece has more reading comprehension than you do\n\n>Fundamentally Ambiguous Questions Cannot Produce Perjurious Answers.\n\n>When a question or a line of questioning is "fundamentally ambiguous," the answers to the questions posed are insufficient as a matter of law to support a perjury conviction." See, e.g., United States v. Finucan, 708 F.2d 838, 848 (1st Cir. 1983); United States v. Lighte, 782 F.2d 367, 375 (2d Cir. 1986); United States v. Tonelli, 577 F.2d 194, 199 (3d Cir. 1978); United States v. Bell, 623 F.2d 1132, 1337 (5th Cir. 1980); United States v. Wall, 371 F.2d 398, 400 (6th Cir. 1967); United States v. Williams, 552 F.2d 226, 229 (8th Cir. 1977). **In other words, when there is more than one way of understanding the meaning of a question, and the witness has answered truthfully as to his understanding, he cannot commit perjury.** Many courts have emphasized that "defendants may not be assumed into the penitentiary" by "sustain[ing] a perjury charge based on [an] ambiguous line of questioning."\n\n
The Editor (current, past, I think both) admitted they're a liberal urban paper. 
Media bias is sadly a present day given.  It is so frustrating how hard hard it is to find any news that isn't biased in some way.  How quaint an idea for news outlets to just give all relevant facts about any given event/idea...\n\nAlso, what are these politicians on all sides thinking?  They seem to lie with such ease to accommodate whatever matter that serves them at the moment, without any concern of the growing body of record data that exists to check them.\n \n\nEdit: a word\n
They won't make an accusation. They are content with just placing an inkling of doubt into peoples' minds that there *could* have *maybe* been some kind of conspiracy theory going on. They don't have enough ground to make an accusation, so they play PR instead.
[Not really without a trace](https://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2017/03/03/us/politics/ap-us-mccaskill-fact-check.html) but it does seem sketchy to remove it from the article, even if they posted another article about her getting caught lying. There are a lot of changes to that article as the story developed, though. 
CSM is pretty good. We went to the CS church growing up, which is pretty wonky in my view now, so I didn't think their newspaper would be any good until I read some of it.
Red State half the time makes click bait headlines and then makes jokes about said headline in the article. 
Yup, even the WaPo admits this. In fact I don't think you can call his answer a 'lie' by any standard especially a legal one.\nhttp://hotair.com/archives/2017/03/03/wapo-dont-count-on-a-perjury-charge-sticking-against-sessions/
In my eye, it gets as close to violating journalistic ethics without actually doing so: "Corrections are published when errors are discovered." \n\nIt's important to not only correct errors, but issue corrections to better acknowledge that incorrect information was out there previously.\n\nTechnically, the NYT didn't publish anything incorrect here as they only published what the senator claimed. However, the original article offered her statement as a contrast to Sessions meeting with some implication that it was adding valuable context by showing how Sessions behavior was abnormal. \n\nNot acknowledging that her statement was incorrect after evidence came out that it was really skirts the line. Is it not important to correct misleading statements just as it is important to correct incorrect statements? Misleading statements can be very dangerous.
Revisionist history at the NYT
The media on both sides make their money by stoking outrage.  I want to start a campaign to boycott American media but I haven't found a reliable conservative outlet anywhere.  I look at BBCNews for the left perspective.  Anyone know any good sites?
Tourism and shipping. 
I'm in the exact same place. It saddens me when the majority of news sources are so liberal / conservative slanted. Also saddens me that I literally have to read a liberal slanted article and a conservative slanted article to get bounds on what the actual truth is. For example, with all this Sessions talk, my thoughts are, "He could have totally perjured himself, or this could literally be nothing."  \n  \nGuess I'll just go back to /r/49ers and go read draft rumors cause thats more "truthy" than half of whats being written :(.
It's more than bias at this point. It's media lying.
People get all weird about it.  They don't understand that there has to be just one article specifically about Christian Science per issue and it's always buried in the back.
We know at least one lied about it: http://truthfeed.com/breaking-democrat-mccaskill-busted-lying-about-past-russian-meetings/54543/
> There's nothing in the text that indicates Sessions can't be held for perjury.\n\nYou can of course try to do it, but no sane prosecutor would because there's literally a 0% chance he would be convicted.
Oh yeah, Wall Street Journal, the paper that claims Pewdiepie is a nazi. My go-to for trusted publications.
No going to lie: I thought this was going to be something silly based on the title. But that is pretty bad by the NYT. \n\nAlso, news diff is a cool site. Some of their examples are kinda funny:\n\n>In an obituary, the start of the lede changed from "She made a mean beef stroganoff" to "She was a brilliant rocket scientist".\n\nEither way, news gets change a lot apparently. Do note that the majority of the changes are typos or updates.\n\nhttp://newsdiffs.org/browse/\n\n
Yeah, the publication has nothing to do with Christian Science anymore. 
Well we now know 7 Dem Senators at least met with the Russian ambassador
The NYT is garbage. But what is the alternative? The best sources of news IMHO are the financial publications. But they are mostly behind paywalls (looking at you FT, and WSJ) and so are good quality magazines on world affairs. Plus financial publications do not have enough articles on other subjects. A lot of the stuff on the right contains a ton of poor journalism.  \n\nAny suggestions? 
As a New Yorker, I want to see it as well.
WSJ is best of the big papers they are pretty Middle of the road. I still suggest Drudge for the best news aggregation
The alt-left are staunch believers in truth-fluidity.\n\nEDIT: What's most disturbing is that she's carrying on with her twitter posts as if nothing happened. She changed her story from "never met with" to "had a group meeting with" after people posted the "going to meet with" tweets. \n\nThere's some type of mental disease here. It's like the alt-left truly believes that whatever they happen to say to uphold their ideology actually happened, despite whether or not it did actually happen. "I just said I never EVER called or met with a Russian ambassador, and therefore I didn't, despite the fact that I actually did AND POSTED ABOUT IT ON TWITTER."
What crime do you actually have reasonable suspicion of? Being secretive is not a crime, releasing taxes is not required by law nor is meeting with russian diplomats. \n\n\nShow me evidence of an actual crime. 
So how exactly does back sweetening work. Just add more honey?
Are you serious? The whole server issue is it was set up to avoid using a .gov address. It stands to reason Huma would avoid using a .Gov as well

I mean, you see her dead in episode 25 or 26...
Sessions met with 25 ambassadors last year, are you making the claim that all of those were outside the scope of his duties on senate committees? \n\nAre you claiming that Sessions met to "colluded" to rig the elections? One of Sessions "meetings" was in a group setting as well.  \n\nFacts man you need them not me, the one accusing has to come up with them, so far I have not seen any. \n\nMcCaskill (being generous here) simply forgot her meetings with the Russians; but her statements were in fact an attempt to paint an insanely corrupt picture that simply was not true; and the press here is actively involved in whitewashing it. That is a *real* fact.
Is it actually possible for you all to discuss anything without resorting to pointing the finger at someone or something else?
Good thing Sessions meets literally zero of the 3 tests required for perjury as established by SCOTUS (all 3 must be met):\n\nhttp://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/politics/special/clinton/stories/whreport8.htm\n\nSo again, I ask, crime? Evidence of crime? legal reasoning behind the alleged crime?\n
Not a source for his claim but relevant.\n https://www.bciu.org/events/55798/business-reception-at-the-democratic-national-convention-with-foreign-ambassadors
That's fair. It just doesn't translate well to a place like reddit where half the people only read the headline and half the headlines are legit clickbait haha
The question was not a general one and neither was the answer, see the bold text. \n\n> "Now, again, I'm telling you this as it's coming out, so you know. But if it's true, it's obviously extremely serious and if there is any evidence that anyone affiliated with the Trump campaign communicated with the Russian government **in the course of this campaign**, what will you do?"\n\n\nTo which Sesssions responded:\n\n\n> "Senator Franken, I'm not aware of any of those activities. **I have been called a surrogate at a time or two in that campaign** and I didn't have — did not have communications with the Russians, and I'm unable to comment on it."\n\n\n
As a New Yorker, I want to see it is to accidentally forget something like this.
Red State isn't The New York Times. \n
LOL \n\n>Now you're just being wilfully ignorant.\n\nLook in the mirror pal. There is NO evidence the Russians meddled with the election results.\n\nThis is all fake news generated by Zero's community organizing located somewhere within the Deep State. You want an investigation? Investigate THAT!
CNN, Politico, USA Today, and NPR are "From the center". I guess their categorization is "Extreme Left", "Center-Left/Mainstream Left", "Everything Else"? Or is their categorization self-reported by the news outlets themselves?
Disappointing and unsurprising.
Overlooking that she was using her supposed lack of contact ~~and~~ as (edit: misplace auto-corrected word) proxy-proof Sessions is lying about contact with ambassadors is part of a senators duties, thus implying these were clandestine meetings. \n\nShe gets bonus bull-shit points for proving how easy senators can forget some of the inconsequential meetings -- given how she did.
1 - that is your generous interpretation. It is just as conceivable that he lied to end the line of questioning.\n\n2 - that was one of the hacks. It was an ongoing campaign to find mud (or anything that could be confused for mud) to sling.\n\n3 - fast and furious was ended many years ago and that AG was already long gone. The IRS scandal is that political pressure from Republicans had them cave on campaign finance rules enforcement, which would certainly have had bipartisan benefits and gotten a few left wing organizations in trouble too. You might have even shut down a Clinton super PAC if there hasn't been an outcry if people who did not understand what was going on.\n\n4 - everyone lost in 2016\n\nWell I'm post limited on this sub now, so enjoy your dogpile
With a first year HC with no experience.\n\nToo many people are forgetting this. 
I was the penguin keeper at my zoo, and I used to wake up every morning and get to experience this....with all the penguin shit on the deck in their enclosure
You're being willfully ignorant. The hacks were a partisan scam to propagandize the liberal public against an incoming president and garner support. Sessions was a member of a committee and had one meeting with the Russian Ambassador out of 25 meetings with ambassadors from a ton of different countries. \n\n> He was questioned under oath at his confirmation hearing and denied any contact.\n\nGo back and listen to the question: he was questioned under oath about contact between the Trump campaign and Russian officials. While he was a member of the campaign, he still had duties to his other job. This single meeting with the Russian ambassador is orders of magnitude less sketchy than Bill's meeting with Lynch, but you sweep that under the rug and pretend it never happened!
As a New Yorker, I want to stand by the NYT, but Christ, they are as bad as CNN now. What kind of professional integrity do they have when they are pulling off brazen stunts like this?
I do need facts, you are sharing your opinion that we should not get facts (a process called "investigation"), and calling that opinion a fact   
Yes, but the NYT has an ideological agenda. They WILL publish lies from democrats, as long as those lies aren't exposed. 
Lie under oath is crime
I just said it was the best big paper I didn't say they were objectively good lol
It is a bit concerning to see how many grammatical edits are corrected after publication online. A bunch of the articles appear to be publish first, edit later. Just look at how many edits the WaPo made today http://newsdiffs.org/browse/washingtonpost.com the majority being grammatical. They also edit old articles from 2016 which seems odd.
This is becoming a problem. The only stories I trust are the stories that point out the lies. \n\nI wait a minimum of a week before I believe anything, just about regardless of source. 
Only do this if you can handle firsthand seeing MSM twist and lie about the events that you just watched. Youll find yourself saying '*thats* what they reported on? *thats* what they made a story out of? Were we watching the same thing?'   
1984 is only half of it. The other half is straight from "A Brave New World"; wherein we are inundated with so much bullshit that we stop caring... which bites us in the ass.
Yes, but only after those people are imprisoned first.
What's wrong with you...it says \n\n"Perjury requires proof that a defendant, while under oath, knowingly made a false statement as to material facts. "
Sessions did not lie under oath, at least not according to you know, the actual law on the matter.\n\nWe can get started on perjury investigations though, starting with Hillary, Rahm, Eric Holder and Clapper who all have far more cut and dry convictions.
You want facts about some unlawful activity on anyone in the Trump administration. The problem is you lack them so you resort to accusing people of hiding the facts you desire.\n\nI am sure you want to go on a fishing expedition and you personally should, the media already is. If you want the DOJ to do it you will need reasonable suspicion.  If you want congress to bend to your desire to hold witch hunts I would suggest that your party try winning enough seats to order said witch hunts. \n\n
I just go to C-SPAN after work and watch the sessions themselves. It's the only way to find out what actually fucking happened anymore. Long-form unedited footage is our best friend right now.
>  MSM won't do shit because of Takeis Japanese internment camp play. \n\n\nIf he plays that card it just opens a whole nother can of worms for them though. \n

Well what happened instead was everyone sitting at tables watching the game on their phone instead of watching the game together and enjoying themselves.\n\nWere in the south in SEC country. This is sacrilege. I know someone who is seriously considering skipping her daughters reception to go to the game. \n\nThe wedding and reception were at the same venue, it went 2-10. It's not like someone wanted to set up a TV behind the alter. This venue was told to take down the TV behind the bar in the lounge (that was installed because so many people ask to have a TV for football)\n\nProtip to southern brides: if you think you're more important than football, you arent. And if you schedule it during rivalry week expect a lot of people not to come

He was legally bound to tell congress, he is not legally bound to follow internal policies that require him to violate the law. That whole line of argument is dumb

Actually he did sign it.
You're absolutly correct. They are extremely strict at their southern boarder.
Nope they're white. And this was 50k on top of still paying for the honeymoon. They just didn't want to deal with wedding stuff
The emails were sent and received by hillary's chief of staff. You can't claim they aren't related to hillary. You're talking about person who actually runs the day to day of hillary's entire life.

And the least convenient time of the year\n\nEdit: why would you schedule a wedding during the fall in the south. It's cold, it rains, it's ugly outside,  it's deer season, and football season. \n\nIt's like trying to schedule something at 9am Sunday. That time slot is already spoken for.
It's old news that she was aware, this proves she actively worked on it. She can't say "I don't recall" and now she can get hammered with "why would you accept donations from a country you say is arming isis"
Congrats brother.\n\nI saw the secretary's signature and was like...wait a second, I've seen that before and had to look closer.

I'm a PC alum with a lot of family that went to UF, I was both looking forward to and dreading that game so my emotions are mixed. \n\nIt would have been a big payday, and it's great exposure for our program, but we would have gotten curb stomped and my cousins would all make fun of me. And unlike most large public schools I can't really fire back with how much better a school PC is than UF...I mean I can, but UF isn't a bad school

This is exactly it. I work in appeals for a health insurance company and handle a lot of administrative appeals. Our plan is built to give you 1 year to appeal for administrative issues.\n\n For example we have a tobacco surcharge. Standard procedure is to turn the surcharge off first of the month after you notify us you don't use tobacco. In some cases people did send the form in, but it wasn't filled out properly, or it wasn't processed correctly, or it was put into the wrong place in their folder so it was never seen, or sometimes if it's a group plan, the group administrator didn't send it in. In those cases we will allow a maximum 1 year of premium refunds because we say it's wasn't their fault the premiums were wrong, but it's there responsibility to make sure the premiums are right, and 1 year is long enough to do that. \n\nMistakes happen, for the price of a stamp you can get most of them fixed through arbitration (at least for us, but we pride ourselves on customer service and are non-profit). Going to court is extremely expensive (and it doesn't cost us anything because our attorneys are on salary instead of retainer so it's not a threat to us and out 99% win percentage)

It's one thing to be accepted. You basically just need to pass a background check and not be a dick head in an interview. \n\nBeing raised is another matter entirely, because it takes months of actually interacting with members. \n\nMasonry also works under the concept of "making good men better" so if he's good enough a man to be a member of your house, and apparently there is room for improvement, then he might benefit greatly from membership.\n\nYou shouldn't judge us based on who we let in, judge us on who those people become.

Yes
Geez. One of my friends parents offered her 50k in cash just to elope. Nope, had to have that fairy tail outdoor wedding....it was 40 degrees and rained. \n\nIt was also on a Saturday during football season and no TVs were allowed in the venue, so she pissed off all of the guy friends who wanted to be able to watch football.
Ya but the exposure can't be bought. It's good for the program, and it's fun to rep the small sacrificial school in the big name schools house

Let me tell you the story of my grandmother's funeral. \n\nIt starts off innocently enough with arguments over open or closed caskets, then you had 2 pall bearers eat shit tripping over the pews. We finally get to the graveside and one of my cousins shows up late as fuck in a t-shirt and jeans. The minister has everyone bow their head for prayer and this mother fucker pulls out a piece of hard candy and unwrap it loud as fuck and starts sucking on it. \n\nSo, and this is the good part, someone in a Russian  motorcycle gang was buried in that cemetery, and in the middle of this prayer the entire convoy of bikers and support vehicles, all sporting pink Mohawks on hoods and helmets, come rumbling through. They drive into the cemetery, go around a loop, and drive back out. The procession lasts about 5 minutes and it brings my grandmother's funeral to a halt.  \n\nEnd the end we joke about getting one of those pink Mohawks for her tombstone since she is certainly an honorary member after that

Doesn't matter. Go learn. It's never too late. My dad was at the gym and there was a 50 something year old black guy there taking swim lessons. He was struggling but refused to give up. He Said he was about to become a grandfather, and nobody in his family knew how to swim, nobody thought they could learn how to swim....well he was determined to learn how to swim so he could personally teach his grandson how to swim wen he was old enough. \n\nYou also never know when it's going to save your life. You have to be able to swim to graduate highschool in some places because of safety concerns.

Mark my words this is how it will play out.\n\nYear 1: watch and wait. See how trump does and how the people react to him. Give him small victories but nothing big.\n\nYear 2: campaign according to how year 1 goes. If the base still loves him start allowing larger victories and protect him from impeachment. But if he loses the base, start blocking him, be "bipartisan" about it. But above all else, don't start impeachment until the house is secured again after the election year. \n\nYear 3: impeach trump. Try to tie pence to it.

Sorry if I annoyed you. I'm actually not trying to have an argument,m; I just wanted to make bay one point. I just wanted it to be clear that by this point we know that Russia hacked the democrats.\n\nWhat I would want now that we recognized that problem, we do something to attempt to stop that from happening in he future as well as all future hacking. What you suggested sounds great. But, we wouldn't be able to achieve that if we don't recognize one of the largest hackings of the last couple years.

Just wanted to clarify one small thing. The Supreme Court found the right to an abortion to be inherent to the right to privacy, which stems from the 4th Amendment.

Sounds about right. Only about 60% of the population votes and he got less than half the votes.
~~Slavery~~ The Civil War and Great Depression were a long time ago and they've had plenty of time to recover. I've known plenty of southerners that have gone on to have tremendous success. That's proof that that doesn't hold them back. Maybe it's time they took responsibility for themselves and stopped victimizing themselves.
I was just pointing out that all those people overstaying their visas are also illegal aliens and "by definition" criminals. I'm sure some are good people. But I agree that the focus should be on kicking out the rapists and drug dealers. \n\nI'm not sure, though, that those would primarily be found physically crossing the border. [Getting a tourist visa to go to the USA from Mexico takes $160 for the application fee and a 9-day wait for your interview. ](https://travel.state.gov/content/visas/en/general/wait-times.html/). That doesn't seem like such a high bar. Seems like plenty of people can scrounge up the $160 and intend to overstay their visa. It's so much easier that walking through the dessert.
That's a general trend I feel like I've noticed. Seems like parts on the internet started being satirically racist (Hitler did nothing wrong) around maybe 2003, but some of those ideas seem to be taken a lot more seriously now. I wonder if kids who saw that back then as a fun taboo back then ended up believing it too
People said that too after young people helped elect Obama and take Congress in '08. Then they couldn't be bothered to show up for mid term elections, which saw the first of several big wins for congressional Republicans. 
It didn't and I appreciate you humoring me as I tried to differentiate between a hacker and a whistleblower, at least by my own definitions. 
You propose an interesting question. You probably should start by defining what a dictator is \n. I can think of several warlords that made it a point to arm everyone. But then again, their environment demanded you to be armed and they were a small people without much power.\n\nYou should consider that guns used to be more important many year ago because of their daily application and their parity with weapons of war. If a real fascist took over the USA, for example, all our rifles would do absolutely nothing to stop our military if it turned against us.
It has to be aggravated murder. Like a serial killer, a child killer, shooting spree, etc. A murder during a riot wouldn't get the death penalty. 
Could you elaborate a bit on that? Would property owned by a public entity be a third type of property akin to personal property because (I assume) everyone owns it? Who would run public entities?
All I stated was the legal standard for defamation, which encompasses libel and slander. It's also true that defamation cases are hard to win in court. I took no position one way or the other. The reason why it's difficult to win those cases is because you have to prove actual malice or a reckless disregard for the truth.\n\nIt's not enough to show that a statement was false. With actual malice, you would have to prove that the reason why that statement was made was to damage the person's reputation. It's not enough to infer their motivation. Further, there's a strange line between facts and people's analysis of them - i.e. opinions. Claiming that someone's politically incorrect talk is emboldening racists is difficult to prove in court as false because it's someone's opinion of the motivations of other people.\n\nA reckless disregard for the truth could be something like asserting something as fact without trying to verify it. In that case they could be liable even if they were unaware of the falsity of the statement. That's why Rolling Stone got in trouble when they published that campus rape story that turned out to be false. They should have tried to corroborate that or at least reported on only the allegations and proceedings. 
Where are these safe zones that everyone on the internet keeps talking about? Are they on colleges campus? Because I've literally never once come across anything like that. It seems ridiculous, but I also have never seen it to be a problem.
Underrated comment
I agree with all that. I definitely think those values could work for a community. But I think there might be a limit to the size a community can be while still retaining those values.\n\nI think the "every man for himself" culture and the "us vs. them" mentality is partly a byproduct of living in a large community. It's easy to be detached from your fellow man if people aren't able to see the consequences of their actions. I'm imagining such a future would be made up of various small communities where people are more inclined to group cooperation.
It's a fair point to the extent that a bankrupt Mexico can't pay us. Plus they're one of our biggest trading partners so that would undoubtedly hurt our economy too.

I can just imagine him trying to wrap his head around the concept that he's only in charge of 1/3 of the US government
I'm sure you're right, but would you have any sources or specific examples I could look up?
There was an article on the woman that got foreclosed because, ironically enough, she was a Trump voter. For obvious reasons, she didn't like that particular cabinet pick.
Defamation of a public figure requires a showing of actual malice or a reckless disregard for the truth. It's a hard standard to meet because of the amount of reverence given to the First Amendment.
I admit I was going a bit far with it. But, I'm just trying to follow the argument to its logical conclusion. I don't understand why you wouldn't support a planned protest that has all the proper permits and governmental approval. Any large protest will necessarily block something and by ensuring compliance with the permitting process, you allow the government to plan for that.\n\nIt's not like it's easy to get those permits so as to make it a regular nuisance. The right to protest is one of the Constitutional rights often exalted to show how great our country is.
That's kind of the nature of intelligence analysis. Analysts are constantly receiving lots of information, some true, some fake, some contradictory, and they have to asses the likelihood of truthfulness of everything and synthesize that with that they already know to the best of their ability. It's the higher ups job to make a decision based on that incomplete information. 
I honestly don't remember Obama mentioning Fox News once in his 8 years. I'm sure he must have, but it definitely was not an issue.
No president deserves unconditional support. He was asking for reasons to support him.
People who don't trust the media will point to the anonymous source as proof that a story is fake news. Yet, they are less likely to take issue with anonymous sources that support their world view without noticing the hypocrisy.\n\nIt's a worrying trend because trust in the media to verify its sources and keep them confidential (because the officials wouldn't speak otherwise) forms the basis of so much of journalism.
Wait, do we not believe it just because it wasn't a product of the American intelligence community? When has that ever stopped us? If anything you would think this makes it more reliable

Seriously. Can someone please just link to the actual law? I wasn't able to find it after a quick search. 
Don't forget nuclear weapons. Cause that makes sense. People seem to have a hard-on imagining that them owning a weapon makes them more powerful and righteous than they are.\n\nLike all other rights, our right to bear arms is not absolute and restrictions can be put in place only if it means the appropriate constitutional scrutiny balanced out against a sufficiently important government interest.
But trump said he thought it was the Russians who hacked the democrats. He should know because he has clearance to see the evidence we can't. Why don't people believe that? You can be mad at what the Wikileak emails reveal AND the Russian hacking of the democrats AND think that that still wasn't enough to sway the election.\n\nAnd despite believing all that, I can also think it's perfectly plausible that the Wikileaks emails might have changed at least one person's mind considering how the emails dominated news coverage for months and how often trump would go on stage and read from the actual emails.
That's some fine police work, Lou
I mean, have you seen him dab?
I was just talking in generalities. But, I would say the exception lies in that the hacker is being motivated by ethical issues. But this is really all semantics so who cares. It's just my view on things. 
Knowing Leo, he was probably making his pitch for the importance of initiatives to deal with climate change. He's passionate about that and there's no way he would give up the opportunity to try to lobby trump. And trump wouldn't give up the pr of having Leo visit him at trump tower
Should've taken them to the swing states and not the most obviously blue state.
He'll blame it on obstructionist democrats and say he can do more as a private citizen who isn't being hampered by Congress. He'll say he really doesn't want to leave, make it seem like it's  a great sacrifice, and that he'll devote himself to saving America. Trump supporters will hail him as a martyr. After a few showy displays that don't mean much, he'll declare victory.
Our weapons would do absolutely nothing to stop a government commanding our military against us. I'm all for the Second Amendment, but that argument always seemed so outdated and silly.\n\nPersonal protection? Sure. Hunting? Duh! Stopping an Abrams tank? You're delusional. 
But the extremists that have committed terrorism acts here weren't nationals from those countries. Nationals from the countries listed [haven't committed a terrorist act since 1975.](https://www.google.com/amp/m.huffpost.com/us/entry/us_588b5a1fe4b0230ce61b4b93/amp) 
I honestly don't know if the American voting public would care. This election changed my assumptions about the electorate.
Is that because of the muslims you've met or because of what's on the news?
I don't understand how she would lose ALL credibility. Witness intimidation is a real thing and that's another possible explanation for her actions. This just means you can't draw any hard conclusions either way.
It's worth considering that the right to vote is a fundamental right granted by the Constitution and, thus, should not be limited unless there is a compelling government interest. Until there is real evidence of voter fraud, I find it hard to support laws that add obstacles to voting. \n\nYou need an ID to drive because that is not a right but a privilege granted by the state and which can be taken away. The other things mentioned are also not fundamental rights, so it is also appropriate to require IDs for them.

That's why I would have preferred for them to have released everything so that they can claim some moral high ground and not look like they're just pushing their political agenda. 
I understand the sentiment. But there is a difference between a planned protest that gets all the permits (and is akin to a parade) and an unplanned protest.
"Mistake of fact" is basically any mistake other than "mistake of law." Generally, the mistake has to be reasonable, but sometimes it can be unreasonable. \n\nOne popular example is a vendor who regularly sells bags of sugar, but then is unknowingly given a bag of cocaine, which he then sells, thinking it's sugar. The "mistake of fact" would keep him from having the requisite mens rea (i.e. the intent) to be convicted for selling the cocaine.
There are VERY few rent controlled apartments left. Some are rent stabilized, which means the rent can only go up whatever percentage the government board says it can. Most apartments are free market.
That's an important distinction to make. This election highlighted the schism between voters with a college education and those without. That doesn't make it a difference between smart and dumb people. I know plenty of smart people that didn't finish college and plenty of dumb people that graduated college.
There are better ones than that at least. Check out the sidebar on /r/stardustcrusaders
Seriously. And if you're that close to the line between legality and illegality, you don't act until you get some formal opinions from lawyers where they say why the action is probably legal. That also helps protect you.
That's moving the goalposts
I've got a little money saved up and sometimes I daydream about quitting my job and living off my savings as long as possible, probably in Thailand or the Czech Republic for a couple of years. I would love the break from the grind. 
You're hired
A protest of any significance will be large enough to block sidewalks for several blocks. Are you just against protests that inconvenience people? So, any large gathering of people should not be allowed? Parades too? Parades definitely have less societal value than the right to protest. 
That's really a big part of it. Some of them are simply ignorant about our way of life and hold entirely different world views. They're not all necessarily bad people.
A much simpler fix would be to allow electoral college votes be divided based on the percentage won. I think that would also encourage people who don't vote because their vote doesn't really count.
You're not going to convince anyone that way. But I guess you don't have to and can choose to just get mad at internet strangers.
There's nothing wrong with that. It's possible those clauses may eventually be interpreted narrowly again. I'm just referring to what the current law is.
As is the nature of much of intelligence analysis. You have to weigh the information you're getting against the credibility of the sources and likelihood of truth. 
If your cheese isn't smoked you're doing it wrong
I check their twitter and didn't find anything saying that. At best, I found an article where the Kremlin denies it (no shit)\n\nhttps://twitter.com/buzzfeednews
No one ever made money betting on Rubio's political courage
That wasn't fake news, there was just a lot of [confusion about how to implement the executive order.](https://www.google.com/amp/mobile.reuters.com/article/amp/idUSKBN15D07S) Green card holders weren't initially being affected, but then a Trump official said green card holders had to check with a US consulate to see if they could return because it would be a case-by-case basis.
I'm not talking about the current situation, but I would say there's a difference between documents being leaked by a whistleblower than by a hacker. The difference being the ethical issues that motivated the whistleblower to act. Also, I would think that a whistleblower would be someone from within the organization as opposed to a hacker that would be an outsider. Of course, there might be some exceptions to this, like when a hacker attempts to expose the wrongdoings they know an organization is committing. 
When people talk about a politician having a mandate, they generally mean someone who won by a large margin. It ties into how much political capital a newly elected politician has.
A pastor preaching politics doesn't seem to be the thing people are worried about. They're probably more worried about the amount of money church-backed super pacs could pump into politics to effect their view, all while not paying taxes on these political donations. Plus, look at the Catholic Church and their $8 billion. That amount of money would definitely buy them some political influence.
He accused any story she will reporting from now on as not being researched nor backed by data because she is now a DNC mouthpiece. That's not an opinion.
The ban isn't supposed to be punishing the countries. It's supposed to be protecting Americans. A consistent position would have him ban immigrants from all countries where there are lots of terrorists, whether or not the country is our friend or foe.
What about all the other majors? Like engineering, business, economics, pre-med, computer science. We can't all be plumbers. You can easily make more money (be more productive) in the long term with a degree in one of these fields than if you had started out as a plumber straight out of high school. 
A mildly prominent Trump supporter said about Michelle Obama: [I’d like her to return to being a male and let loose in the outback of Zimbabwe where she lives comfortably in a cave with Maxie, the gorilla.](https://mobile.nytimes.com/2016/12/27/nyregion/carl-paladino-michelle-obama.html)
Not to mention that foreign aid is less than 1% of the budget
Thanks a lot for that detailed response. What I don't understand, though, is how we will make things like cars or computers to own as personal property if it's not first developed and made by an entity with private property? Would this system require any computers or cars we buy be purchased directly from a person who has to have built it?
Now sissy that walk

Let's not forget that there were two comedy shows based on W. I think they were called Lil Bush and That's My Bush.
I've seen a lot of people make fun of protestors for allegedly not having jobs, being complainers unwilling to accept that they lost, and that protestors shouldn't be allowed to inconvenience anyone else by blocking streets other people need to use.
People are ignoring the role played by smartphones. More protests took place because of the slew of videos that were appearing capturing the police confrontation (albeit, sometimes without the full context).\n\nIf you watch a video of someone getting choked, saying he can't breathe, and he dies, you're going to be mad. Should he have complied? Sure. But failure to comply shouldn't have meant his death when he clearly posed no mortal danger. 
In that case, I don't see a distinction between the aforementioned personal property and private property. The same government that enforces private property as previously defined would be needed to enforce the protection of an individual's personal property. Otherwise who else would stop someone from taking others personal property. 
Legal practitioners also see witness intimidation every day. Most of the time, the intimidation that occurs is to keep the wife from saying anything to the police (or friends) and so cops can never bring charges against the husband. I've also seen plenty of cases where an abusive husband buys his wife's continued silence through a relatively favorable divorce settlement.\n\nI'm not trying to argue for or against Bannon. I know nothing about him and I'm not trying to take sides. I'm speaking more generally about the credence that should be given when people fail to testify or report. Legally speaking, you can't draw a conclusion either way without such a testifying witness. Thus, Bannon isn't innocent or guilty, he's simply not guilty.\n\nSorry for being "that guy," but I just wanted to clarify that failure to testify should not be construed against the witness.

Classic movie. You should watch it. 
Thanks for this. I don't see this sentiment often enough. We all need to do our best to not get mad, make our arguments, and maybe even try to understand the other side.
I feel like we got off topic. I wasn't looking for an argument or to exchange so many messages so this will probably be my last one.\n\nI agree that I doubt trump wants people hacking into him and hopefully he's successful in doing something about it. The only thing that bothered me was his continual denial of the Russian involvement until just yesterday. And now that's fixed. Good. That's all I wanted.\n\nMy issue with your comment was when you seemed to claim that there was no Russian involvement:\n\n> It "appears" so, because of a liberal-slanted media as well as some weasel-y intelligence leaders. This is misinformation. \n\n After trump admitted to Russia's involvement in hacking American politicians, he pivoted to the other hacking China has done. And I agree with him that that's a big problem too. Hopefully he can take care of all of that. 
Maybe it's just semantics but I respect the office and I want every president to be successful. But I also want presidents called out whenever they overreach or mess up.
I think he could resign, but spin it as some great sacrifice because he can help America more as a private citizen not being obstructed by Congress. Trump supporters will hail him as a martyr.
I thought I heard that food and other basic products were a lot cheaper though. At least when compared to the 1950s.
Yes and yes
I've heard the argument that by forcing ourselves into a corner it will force Congress to come up with something, which they have failed to do thus far. Sounds idiotic and dangerous. 
I don't see how all his corporation's information would be public. Isn't it a private corporation (not publicly traded) and so it has many less disclosure requirements?
Well, she was a senator for a while, but your point still stands
How you liking him so far? Was the thinking that Trump would be so divisive within party lines that it would cause the Republican or Democratic Party to splinter and thus bring down the two-party system? \n\nSo far, it looks like the democrats are coalescing against Trump while figuring out how to retool their message, and the republicans are quietly protesting Trump while following the party line, which is now incredibly anti-trade. I don't see any viable third party using this chaos to come into the spotlight. 
Automata is partially developed by platinum games (see Bayonetta, Wonderful 101). The gameplay is GREATLY improved from nier and drakengard.

By streaming instead of staying with the channel, he can choose what he plays and when he plays it instead of working with the other three. He also only has to worry about his own schedule and needs instead of all four of the guys. As someone with anxiety, I can understand perfectly why Twitch streaming would be preferable to Liam.

Neither. It's legitimately a good game.
I think he was agreeing, not correcting.
BUT THAT'S WRONG! Xion is Sora's nobody, Roxas is Ventus's. They both formed when Sora got heartless'd because Ventus's heart was hanging out in Sora's body since he got rocked in birth by sleep. So Sora never ACTUALLY knew who he was.\n\nE: a friend of mine informed me that Roxas is in fact Sora's nobody, he just looks like Ventus because his heart was involved too. Xion is some sort of bullshit artificial nobody that the organization made with Sora's memories.
Good luck guys!
It's hilarious because "jerk" should also be considered ableist by this logic. Its an insult stemming from the tendency of some people with degenerative diseases to jerk around when moving.\n\nBut ableism is retarded so

Playing with sword and shield in the first game is still some of the most dumb fun I've ever had in a game. Shame the series didn't go anywhere

Couldn't you apply this logic to nearly every freedom though? 
I mean he was a major part candidate, how was he not legitimate in the first place lol.
Might want to look into a car. Probably faster most of the time to drive to Friendship Heights then metro from Arlington or Alexandria. I live in Alexandria and usually leave around 7 to go to around Tenleytown and that takes about 30min, metro takes at the very very least an hour. Any delays are just gonna add to that. 
EMT here, shit like this all the time. Call goes out for an unconscious person, we get there and she had just been sleeping.
Your guess is as good as mine lol. All rules and regards go out the window when it comes to guns. Generally they way to address a Public Health issue is to address the underlying reason something occurs. You'll find very few people that say the cure for the opioid epidemic to so get rid of all opioids and further the war on drugs. Instead, people will generally try and get people help and address the reasons people are abusing in the first place. For whatever reason they don't apply this same logic to guns, the cure for guns is get rid of them all.  
You were not kidding. They seriously think the law is perfectly justified. They also then throw out some bull shit about nudity in the U.S. Trump could Tweet hardcore porn right now and its not like criminal charges would be brought. 
What if you go to the store, can you handle one there? Or rent? 
EMT here, yes they do lol. Or vomiting a few times, or knee is sore, or slept wrong and now my neck hurts, or any other litany of Non emergent issues. Where I volunteer at in Maryland, residents of the county don't pay for ambulance service so abuse galore. 
Its worse when you look at more then obese and throw oversight int her. Only 30% of the population is normal weight or underweight. 70% of the population does not have a condition haha. \n\n
I have a professor that used to teach at BYU previously. She is way more conservative than my other professors. She started the first day of class with:\n "I don't want anyone in this room to assume everyone else in the room is a liberal. Just because this is a college campus does not mean everyone holds liberal view." \nMade me happy to hear that. Keeping in mind I go to school in Washington, D.C. a city where 4% of the population voted for Trump. So it is outstandingly liberal. The College Republicans at my school consist of about 20 people out of almost 8,000. 
Ah I see, I just like seeing what other places require!
Awesome that you don't have to sign up or sign into anything to see the info. Unlike pretty much every other hiking site it seems. 
And by that same logic Northern Virginia should be a lawless hell hole of gun violence. 
Even just to handle one?
Followup and funny enough, I parked in the same spot and got another notice. This time the car was not even there for 24 hours when someone called it in. They don't count weekends in the total number of hours so I does not need moved until Wednesday. So guess where its sitting until then, same spot.

I still listen to him! I think I learned about his sophomore or junior year of high school, so like 2006 or 07. I had this marketing class which was really just mess around on computers for an hour. This kid would blast Basshunter to piss the teacher off. Ahh good times.

I was never completely amazed by them like some people are, but they are close to me and transfers are cheap enough. I've never actually bought a gun from them though. 
And then you accidentally park in that non-metro garage. 
Well that blue/yellow line through that section is pretty old, so that may be one of the reasons.

Guess I will be sticking to only Southwest now. 
Yup, still cannot use it. Most, at least in college will recommend it as a source to get a general background on the subjects though. 
What if you have a saiga and a 12 round non-drum magazine. Thats legal?
Here's the funny thing, I've actually met Larry King of the Franklin Credit Union. He works at a place my friends previously did. I met him a few times, but didn't put two and two together until another friend, who also works there realized it. 
This was just them taking a nap lol, but you know how it is. 
Thanks! I will go to the meeting. I called the police non-emergency line and the lady there told me I could literally move it up one spot and that takes care of the issue. What a dumb rule! Which I did move up one space. There is always tons of parking where I live so I don't know who was complaining. 
Ah I see, I have a folding stock VEPR 12 and wanted to order the 12 round magazines for it, but probably will just get the 10s to be safe. 
They got rid of that law last year. 
I'm st school right now, but I'll post some when I get home tonight. 
Yeah thought it was an odd choice, not a Democrat many know. Maybe did that on purpose, taking any exposure off the stars. 
Exactly, you do not have to hate literally everything about Obama and his foreign policy. Just like you do not have to like everything about Trump and his policy.

Oh damn, I thought it wasn't just if you were going to own one. That sucks you can't even rent one. 
Just got a brand new VW Golf for $16,000 out the door. Plus he listed the MSRP on the Civic. No one is paying that.

We have that as well, but this was someone who literally was just taking a nap at home. 
Washington, D.C. is pretty horrendous. Pot holes and filled in pot holes as far as the eye can see.
I have both, I'd say the VEPR 12. I shoot it more then my AK. It's just bad ass and fun as shit to shoot. Whether clays or just blowing a target away it's fun. 
Too big for me, 43 for me. 
Well our nursing homes don't even seem to know CPR lol. They will just stand around until ems arrives. 
I do it everyday commuting into the city. Never had an issue and still enjoy it. I say do it. 
Go to school in Washington, D.C. its real. People there are too  busy being offended to be drunk. 
Its just so petty. There was literally open spots in front and back of my car, there always are.

I agree. I think she gets out of her element sometimes and that is why she gaffs. She never struck me as doing it with ill intent.

I did your guys spring and trigger swap myself, because I had the older non-welded one or whatever. I just have to say, its a night and day difference from stock!
I ride around the area a lot, I can recommend some routes if you tell me how far you want to go and such. 
Oh god that article. I still remember the first time I ever stumbled across it. I think it was linked from here to the huge  r/conspiracy post on it and I got it from there. 
I always ride my bike back in Holmes Run, kinda creepy now. It does get desolate back there at times. Especially when you get across the water crossings on the section towards Columbia Pike. Once saw two guys trying to drive a lowered Honda Civic down the trail path from the Columbia Pike parking area. Kinda odd. 
You own the stores around the DC area? 
Yeah that's why I ride it often and it's easy to get to the Cameron run side by bike. 
Its better to just get used to it honestly. When you get to college it will be worse. You will have professors talk about politics in classes that have nothing to do with politics. You'll have some good professors that are open to all viewpoints though, but most wont be that way. 
Can this go on a normal lower? 
Wow, not even college age kids, but children. 
I don't think they were talking about the guy to the right. I had to google him but Bob Mnunchin looks different. His fiancee is easy on they eyes tho
Its really gonna depend on the person and their weight such, but really your best is to call poison control if you're really worried. If you take high doses of ibuprofen over time it can really mess with you and cause damage. If you take like 800mg which is the recommended max dose I believe your probably gonna be fine. 
Lots of terrorists in Pickens County, Alabama I hear... /s

Isnt it just drum magazines on a shotgun that are illegal in that case?\n\nhttp://leg1.state.va.us/cgi-bin/legp...cod+18.2-308.8\n§ 18.2-308.8. Importation, sale, possession or transfer of Striker 12's prohibited; penalty. \n\nIt shall be unlawful for any person to import, sell, possess or transfer the following firearms: the Striker 12, commonly called a "streetsweeper," or any semi-automatic folding stock shotgun of like kind with a spring tension drum magazine capable of holding twelve shotgun shells. A violation of this section shall be punishable as a Class 6 felony. \n(1993, c. 888.) \n\nOr is there another law I'm missing?
The law would have lower the age for military to 18 from 21. Maybe the governor doesn't know that military can already use DD-214. Who knows. 
Ah I see, here in Virginia I paid $50 for my license. Thats the state maximum, some cities and counties charge less. I didn't have to do a class, because I was in the military at the time. 
I mean Trump could Tweet out hardcore porn right now and that isn't breaking the law. Would it be unpopular probably, but no criminal charges would be brought. 
Why did you have to preface with the fact you are not a Trump supporter just to write clarification? Lol
Fair enough, guess legitimizing him is the same buzz word as saying he shouldn't be "normalized"
Sad thing is, people in Hawaii probably do not even care. That state is top to bottom Democrat.  The state senate has zero republicans. It's 100% dem.

Wouldn't it be more progressive to expand all rights, including gun rights? 
Maybe they will hold off on passing it until after the election, hoping a Republican gets elected. 
Hasn't it been historically, despite the stereotype, Texas isn't all that great on gun laws? 
Didn't the order say that contractors cannot be used to fill positions?
I also live in Alexandria, in pretty much the same situation as you. I have to take the bus to get to the metro station and at that point, that's like half my commute if I drove. 
Thats how one of my local stores is! You can handle anything in the store, don't have to ask anyone to grab it for you. Pretty nice!
Yeah I don't know how all these people are "relaxing" on the metro lol. If you go during rush hour, you are more stressed about squeezing onto a standing room only train. Non rush hour, it's just almost always going to be faster to drive. It's even faster during rush hour depending on where your going. 
Ah, so a bunch of out of shape people barely running three miles in 28 minutes. Or maybe that was just my unit... haha 
Nah I wouldn't be upset, it's part of the job. Plus what you called for was initially more of an emergency than half the stuff we get called for. 
How would the City "do something" lol, they really think the City is not going to let someone move in just because of their views. 
Probably should have clarified better lol, I got rid of the mini to get the Golf. The Mini was pushing 80,000 miles and was starting to have issues (timing chain rattle) that were not going to be worth it to fix. So I traded it in while it was still worth something. 
How does the combo work? Do you need two modules?
It is obviously "rigged" /s
Isn't it how they did the pro-tour draft? Didn't they remove the expeditions? The other week someone opened a mana crypt. Turn one Lanthu Hellion on the play is not fun to be against. While rare, they are overpowered in limited.

> Under Trump's plan students in crappy neighborhoods won't just have the opportunity to attend private schools but public schools in other towns.\n\nThat is the reason I support vouchers and charters. Charter school expansion was on the MA ballot this year which I support because the best high schools are in the best towns (more funding due to more tax revenue and can attract better teachers) and pretty much all of them do not allow cross-district enrollment. In the same way that there are families that cannot afford expensive private schools, there are families that cannot afford to move to towns with top notch school districts. There is not enough flexibility and competition in the public schools to hold the bad schools and teachers accountable.\n\nEdit: Looked up the cost in MA for inter-district enrollment. The average expected cost is listed as $5000 which is the cap. That is a very high cost for trying to provide a choice... probably isn't even an option for a lot of families http://www.doe.mass.edu/finance/schoolchoice/preliminary-choice16.html
Both of you are pretty far off the truth. His leaked tax return showed him using a known loophole that he wants closed, not tax evasion, but tax avoidance. The FBI has cleared Trump's and his manager's connections to Russia. Trump is less transparent because he does not have to be. When Clinton was a public servant, she was subject to FOIA. Whether you believe it was okay or not to use a private server, her handling and deletion of emails violated the FOIA which tarnishes her transparency.\n\nhttp://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/01/us/politics/fbi-russia-election-donald-trump.html\nhttp://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/us/politics/trump-taxes-loophole.html\n\nhttp://lawnewz.com/high-profile/everyone-is-missing-the-most-troubling-part-of-hillary-clinton-email-audit/
The judiciary act calls for a minimum of six justices so they have to add justices eventually I believe 
> This system also neglects the idea of white flight. Students at better schools will leave the second poorer students arrive. Forced to fill seats, the school then has to drop their standards of admission and a once great school is now a mid level school, and the public schools have little funding left and a significantly worse base to work from.\n\nI am a bit confused on where this comes from? From the intra/inter-district plans in place, schools are allowed to refuse kids from other schools if they do not meet academic standards or their admittence would displace/hurt kids within the school's own district. Your school can also refuse transfer if it would affect their racial and ethnic balance. There are already regulations in place to prevent your fears.\n\nFrom what I have read, the voucher system allows you to apply to other districts and schools but does not guarantee you a place there. Currently, you pay taxes to your local district and are locked into those schools. If your district has a program in place to allow you to send your kid to another district, you can take advantage of it, if you pay the additional costs. In MA, the expected average cost is the cap of $5000. That is expensive when you consider how much you are already paying in your taxes. With a voucher, you could use the tax dollars that would have gone to you local district to pay for the inter-district fees.
It is ridiculous to say the Obama administration was free of scandal Just to name a few, IRS, DoJ wiretapping the Associated Press, Fast and the Furious, etc... It is arrogant for him to say he has never had a scandal.\n\n> He's not aloud to share his disagreement with SCOTUS? TIL\n\nTIL Obama was the first president to disagree during the State of the Union and directly to the justices. It is a serious rebuke unlike any before, particularly from one government branch to another. Presidents have shown their dismay with SCOTUS before but never at such a large, choreographed event. Bush criticized the courts for Boumediene v US at a press conference in Rome because that is the proper place to say those criticism. SCOTUS should not be publicly shamed for interpreting the law and doing their job. The situation was made worse by the fact that people surrounding the Justices stood to clap and that Obama, as a Senator, had voted against Alito and Roberts during their confirmations (both in the majority for Citizens United v FEC). It was a knock at the legitimacy of the courts and an attempt to politically influence the Justices by dragging them into a public debate. http://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/29/us/politics/29scotus.html\n\nBy the way, Politifact rated your third quote as "Mostly False" http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/jan/27/barack-obama/obama-says-supreme-court-ruling-allows-foreign-com/

The chant "CPD KKK, how many kids did you kill today" is just a rehash of the anti-Vietnam War chant "Hey Hey LBJ, how many kids did you kill today." It made more sense back then tho.
We need to not provoke the country the is occupying a sovereign nation (Tibet), that does not recognize Taiwan, that is building military bases in international waters, and flew nuclear bombers around Taiwan the week before the Trump call? They are just as, if not more, belligerent than Russia and their economy is not collapsing like Russia's. 
The President does not set Congressional agenda. Compromise works when both parties want to make a change or achieve a similar goal. If both parties want a new trade deal but disagree on minor details, then you make a compromise for a common end. Then if one side backs out, they are being recalcitrant. \n\nWith the issue of healthcare, there were deep divide between the parties on how to solve it. The Dems wanted the ACA and the Reps rejected that solution as show by no Reps voting for it. On a basic level, the ACA is more federal involvement, which is something Reps have generally rejected. You cannot blame a group for not being willing to compromise when they do not believe in the proposed law. No one blamed Obama for not compromising on the Reps attempt to repeal the ACA because he did not believe in repeal in toto. The attitude that the Reps just didnt want to compromise is seductive and plays well to the Dem base, but you cannot blame the other side for not compromising when they wanted nothing to do with the ACA from the beginning. 
I see now. I thought era only gave 1 energy for 1 mana. My bad.
Yes, 2FA has been around for a while now. It only got popular recently after Google introduced it for gmail in 2011, but previously companies like RSA and VASCO made hardware and software 2FA keys. The government was relatively slow to move to it. NIST did not publish a standard for it until 2013, but FFIEC had been encouraging multi-factor auth for banking companies since 2001.\n\nBut the article references the "unclassified email system" which should not be used for sensitive data to begin with so how much more protection does it really need, not sure...
You can be both concerned for the environment and concerned for how environmental concerns should be handled. Pruitt is too skeptical on climate change for me to like him. I also think Al Gore's carbon tax scheme was terrible.

The article about it all that I thought was pretty good was https://news.vice.com/article/the-salacious-ammo-even-donald-trump-wont-use-in-a-fight-against-hillary-clinton-bill-clinton (it sites politico who has images of the court documents about bill's involvement).\nIt covers Donald's connection and goes as far as to contact the attorneys, who cleared Donald of wrong doing. The facts of the case make him look okay honestly as he was one of the few to respond to the subpoena. I don't believe in any pizzagate conspiracies but Epstein got off extremely easy for running a child prostitution ring.
Add gay marriage. David H. Koch voiced his support back in 2012.
Do you have any proof of Trump contacting Epstein after the conviction? From what I've read, Trump barred Epstein from his Miami club in 2007 before Epstein was convicted and Trump actually responded to Virginia Robert's attorney's subpoena.\n\nhttps://news.vice.com/article/the-salacious-ammo-even-donald-trump-wont-use-in-a-fight-against-hillary-clinton-bill-clinton

His Chief of Staff said he was "free of scandal." Obama said it himself on 60 Minutes: "first administration in modern history that hasn’t had a major scandal in the White House." There are plenty of people who have said he didn't have problems or scandals. (http://www.cbsnews.com/news/60-minutes-barack-obama-eight-years-in-the-white-house/)\n\nHe was also the first president to try to publicly shame SCOTUS during a major televised speech, the state of the union. That does not show a lot of respect or dignity, especially when the justices were sitting in the first two rows in front of him. (http://www.politico.com/blogs/politico-now/2010/01/justice-alito-mouths-not-true-024608)
India is definitely a no-brainer when it comes to allies in Asia that are also concerned with Chinese expansion. India is also capable of and willing to stand up to China in the region. I am happy to see Trump broadcasting his support of strengthening US-India relations.

Paul Ryan proposed a replacement and Price was working on his during the Trump campaign so there were plans floating around. I just don't think they believed it would necessarily happen so why put so much focus on replace.

Both are good professors. Lauer is definitely better organized (you can find his class webpages dating back years to look at the syllabus). Every class I took with him features weekly quizzes. Personally, I did not enjoy Ciaraldi's teaching style. It was rather plain lecturing which always put me to sleep. For CS2303, the differences will probably not be too big, but I prefer Lauer for high-level courses.
Yes and vice news did a piece outlining trump's connection. Epstein was a member of trump's palm beach club, Mar-a-lago. It was where Epstein recruited Virginia. Trump would eventually ban Epstein from the club for being inappropriate with a masseuse but other reports allege Epstein was inappropriate with another member's daughter. Pretty much everyone in the investigation refused subpoena except Trump. Virginia Robert's attorney said they had a nice, voluntary chat and that it was obvious trump was not involved in the illicit activity. I wish I was a fly on the wall for that as the way Trump talked about Epstein lets on that he knew that Epstein was up to no good. The only proof of trump being on the Lolita express is from epstein's brother as he does not appear in the detailed flight manifests Epstein kept. Trump appears in epstein's phone records and directory but hardly proves any wrongdoing. The Maxwells were also members of Trump's club. Robert Maxwell was a member of British parliament and his daughter was esptein's mistress/recruiter. The connections in this case are very interesting...\nhttps://news.vice.com/article/the-salacious-ammo-even-donald-trump-wont-use-in-a-fight-against-hillary-clinton-bill-clinton
In Trump's defense, he voluntarily talked with Virginia's attorney who said it was obvious that Trump was not involved in Epstein's illicit activity. Trump's connection is mainly through the club he owns in palm beach that Epstein was a member of and Virginia worked at as a locker room attendant.
He does own a store. He talks about it in other videos.
How dare Trump do that... It's not like China flew nuclear bombers around Taiwan the week before in a show of strength. It's not like they occupy the Crimea, they only occupy Tibet. Who cares about a bunch of atolls in international waters... The right may "love" Russia but the left has shown a love for China that is dangerous. End of the day, you can't fight two wars on two different fronts at the same time. Even Obama realizes it with the naval build up in the Pacific.

I have not read anything that supports your first point. There is a difference between providing a public option and having an insurance mandate. The mandate has been proposed as a fix regardless of there being a public option or not. The public option has been proposed regardless of there being a mandate or not. I am not doubting that a mandate would force the younger, healthy people into the insurance pools providing balance, but just a public option does not accomplish what you laided out from what I've read.
I wish he had been harsher on the question of favoring religious minorities. John Kerry declared ISIS was committing a genocide of Christians and Yazidis in Syria. The Obama administration weakly helped and it is reflected in low numbers of Christian Syrian refugees compared to the general population of Syria. 
I found the release cycle to be rather random and slow. They released every set 1/6 at a time which is not a lot of cards. It was a lot of effort to continually keep up with and test. Rotation is every 6 years or something weird. There is a decent amount of errata. Limited is pretty much ignored too.
The ultimate irony is the clip of Spencer saying he is "inspired by Milo's events which cause stirs on campuses". They are trying to use the clip to show some relation to Milo when Spencer is on record saying he does not consider Milo to be Alt-right. Spencer is talking about the planning of his Danger Zone Tour. He said he was inspired by the way Milo turned negative publicity (the protests) into support. Specifically, after Spencer's Texas A&M event, he said “The media was frothing at the mouth for this event,” and “These types of events are tremendous opportunities for us to communicate our message," and "They are ways for us to reach millions of people who would otherwise never have heard our ideas.”\n\nDoes the MSM not realize that giving actually White Nationalist figures like Nathan Damigo a national platform and publicity is dangerous and promoting his views? or do they just not care?
“But I’ll make you this promise. There will come a day where you will cry out for the enforcement of the law,” Mr. Gowdy said. “There will come a day when you long for the law to be the foundation of this republic.

There was the huge deal made of Trump's server communicating with Russia that was explained pretty easily as a marketing server. It was quite popular on reddit and HRC tweeted about it. That was pretty fake.
The backing from this suit appears to be from a Jerry Springer Show producer. I am spectical of this to say the least. http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2016/07/21/trump-rape-accusers-turn-on-each-other.html\n\nThis is also a mess of Jeffrey Epstein connections. It's not surprising Trump would know Epstein as they were in the same social circle and Epstein was a big player in NYC. Viginia Roberts, one of the more outspoken Epstein accusers, worked at Trump's Palm Beach Club which Epstein was a member of and eventually banned from. Trump was also one of the only social elites to have the balls to help in the Epstein investigation. Trump was cleared of wrong doings to do with Epstein and Roberts. In the end, Epstein got a gold-plated deal from the DoJ even though there was more than enough proof. https://news.vice.com/article/the-salacious-ammo-even-donald-trump-wont-use-in-a-fight-against-hillary-clinton-bill-clinton\n\nThe whole thing reeks and looks to be a money grab. Look how much they want for the video and how no one is touching it. If this was something, it would be out there already.
I think that is the wrong album cover for CLPPING. That album cover is for midcity.
The source says nothing about the nature of the attacks too and references the hacking of the "unclassified email system". They could have breached the system entirely or just socially engineered users, which a private server really doesn't protect against. They think the email that phished Podesta was released in the Wikileaks dump (http://www.cnn.com/2016/10/28/politics/phishing-email-hack-john-podesta-hillary-clinton-wikileaks/). He ran a phishing email past campaign IT and they said it was okay. Hillary and Podesta would have had better protection using a google account with 2FA.\n\nWe are extremely quick to jump to point fingers for attacks which could have been prevented. No one wants to talk about how inadequately prepared our officials and systems are for cycbersecurity. It seems like we are leaving the front doors unlocked.
There are 538 electoral votes (1 for every senator and representative). Every state is guaranteed three electors (number of senators + number or reps). So a state like wyoming only has 3 electoral votes because its population is not big enough to earn more. In a proportional system, it would receive less than 3 so some votes are redistributed from larger states to the smaller states to cover the difference. The electoral college attempts to keep the bicameral system that the legislative branch is based on.

If you deem this post to not be "from a distinctly conservative point of view," then remove the post. \n\nThis post has a decent amount of upvotes showing that people want to have this discussion and a re-evaluation of views and values. Do we really need to ensure the comment sections are an echo chamber by banning a person whose comment history shows he has conservative values and proposed an alternative view. To be conservative, do you have to reject the notion of climate change? This video supports the views of conservatives like Ben Shapiro. It supports the view that climate change is happening but that the effects, extent and solutions are up for discussion. There is a link in the sidebar to r/climateskeptics. Can there not be posts or comments challenging it?\n\nWhat rule did you deem /u/wsh009 to have broken? Do you need to then joke about banning /u/wsh009?

Who do you think he should have appointed? It seems to me that whenever he picks an established politician for a position, everyone claims how voters are idiots for believing in "draining the swamp." Now, he picked a non-establishment person, but everyone is railing him for not having experience. Seems like a lose-lose situation. I understand that Carson does not have experience as in government but he definitely sets himself apart from 50 cent and Jay-Z looking at his medical and academic achievements. I don't think an incompetitent-boob could become the youngest head of pediatric nuerosurgery for nearly 30 years especially considering it was at John Hopkins.

He mentions it for the Death panels bullshit but skips over it for the Obama clip. Instead, he equates it to a cute scene of a dad telling his kid he will protect them from anything and just a ridiculous promise that we should have know was never going to be true.\n\nAnd how is it disguised?

But the 1980s called, asking for its foreign policy back.
Americans are conditioned to be weary of Russia especially the older generations. Trump made some comments about Putin's popularity in Russia and in comparison to Obama. A lot of the Russian comments we have heard are trying to spin Trump as pro-Russia. It also makes Clinton seem tough on foreign policy.

Risk corridors do exist but do not work. The authors assumed that they would be net revenue nuetral but in the end the pools were so high risk that most insurers lost money and therefore the corridor was unable to self fund. Another promise that failed. Rubio simply said that, if the corridors will self fund, then why do you need a backdoor provision to provide a bailout? A bailout would just give more money to insurers and perpetuate a failing system which would only cost the taxpayers more. Risk corridors did not work because they were designed with faulty assumptions.
The NYT source was debunked. Ends up the guy had been released from the transition team before Perry joined and even admitted that the quote used was out of context. http://www.mediaite.com/online/new-york-times-faces-backlash-after-sole-source-repudiates-anti-rick-perry-story/
My grandma had a similar issue. Her UTI went undiagnosed, she fainted. The hospital doctor immediately assumed that it was stroke. The stroke treatment obviously didn't work and made her worse. It was a terrible decline. She had no memory and no muscle control. Luckily, her PCP caught it as he knew her history and what UTIs are capable of. Once she got treatment, it was a complete reversal.\n\nUTIs are common among elderly and, as you said, the symptoms are not obvious.
It is because the Preamble to the Constitution outlines several functions of the federal government. The police fall under "establish justice, insure domestic tranquility" and the military falls under "provide for the common defense." Programs labelled as "socialist" generally fall under the General Welfare Cluase: "promote the general welfare." This clause's meaning has always been a point of contention starting with two famous federalists, Madison and Hamilton. Madison said its purpose is to qualify the government's ability to collect taxes for powers already given such as national defense. Hamilton argued for a broader interpretation and that it allowed the government to collect taxes to pay for education, agriculture, etc. Republicans usually favor Madison's interpretation and Democrats favor Hamilton's.

“The duties of the Senate are set forth in the U.S. Constitution. Nowhere in that document does it say the Senate has a duty to give Presidential nominees a vote.

I will try to clarify your response as it relates to Tom Price's Empowering Patients First Act:\n\n> the Republican plans don't offer any individual marketplace that would let you purchase a plan while you're searching for work.\n\nThis is addressed in two ways. The first is getting away from just employer healthcare and allow organizations to establish individual and small employer membership associations (IMAs). The idea here in Title II is that an organization like a trade union could offer healthcare to its members. While not a marketplace, this does mean people will have access to more pools. Title VIX establishes State Transparency Plan Portals. While these are not marketplaces, they standardize and distribute information on purchasable insurance (and Medicaid) in your state including price and coverage.\n\n> So if you're unemployed for too long, you pay through the nose when you finally get back to work (and back on insurance).\n\nThe plan expands HIPAA protections to individual plans. Before the ACA, if you had a group plan, the insurer could only exclude services for a pre-existing condition for 18 months and your premium can be increased by 50% for 3 years. That protection did not exist in the individual market previously. This approach seems reasonable and politically possible. Pre-existing conditions pose a challenge as it is hard to balance the importance that those with the conditions maintain continuous coverage (not just coverage when needed) but not being too punishing if they have a gap.\n\n> Coupled with the cuts to Medicaid\n\nThe cuts come from repealing the ACA and its Medicaid expansion provision. Price's plan does not reinstate the expansion.
The Nazis were not the only economic nationalists. Economic nationalism was extremely common as it was the national economic progression once merchantilism collapsed. You are using the term "economic nationalism" with a very rigid definition. Alexander Hamilton was an economic nationalist with a liberal protectionist slant. His economic nationalist ideas are encompassed in "Report on the Subject of Manufactures." He did not advocate the "Buy only American goods" line, but that we need to protect our developing manufactuering industry from cheap imports from counties with larger, established manufactuering industries. The Nazis may have had an economic nationalist movement but they in no way defined it.
The EPA is not only concerned with dangerous pollutants. CO2 is a greenhouse gas and the EPA considers large quantities of greenhouse gases to be dangerous to the environment. Believing this, the EPA decided to regulate emissions. Their policy is allowed to change. I simply fear that Pruitt may steer too far in the other direction.
He voluntarily talked to Virginia's lawyer, Brad Edwards, when they subpoena-ed him.

He definitely hit the buzzwords and a bunch of the plans are just number tweaks but I do not remember him even saying the name of any of the 4-5 prominent replacement plans. For anyone that is not paying attention and already knows a bit about the plans, there is not a lot of information to go on for further research. Oliver definitely presented this as "my word is gospel, don't bother looking into it further"
A person in North Dakota's vote isn't being counted against a person in New York's when they vote for President either. There is no popular vote. Each state decides how it wishes to determine its electors. The standard is popular vote within each state.\n\nTechnically the senate is winner takes all... there is only 1 seat up for grabs which goes entirely to the winning candidate.
The problem for me is that he only focused on Price's Empowering Patients First Act. There are 4 plans being discussed and personally I don't mind that it is taking a bit to figure out because it is not a simple subject. But Oliver just ignored the differences between the plans and went all in on bashing Ryan and Price (http://dailysignal.com/2017/01/23/a-look-at-four-of-the-gops-obamacare-replacement-plans/). He also says Continuous Coverage Incentives have not been properly explained but Ryan already outlined how they worked back in 2016 in the Better Way reform proposal (https://www.forbes.com/sites/realspin/2017/01/28/will-paul-ryans-obamacare-replacement-work-for-people-with-pre-existing-conditions/#474fdfd37b3a). Oliver also mischaracterizes risk corridors and why they were removed to begin with and uses the single example as a "pattern" of GOP undermining the ACA (http://kff.org/health-reform/issue-brief/explaining-health-care-reform-risk-adjustment-reinsurance-and-risk-corridors/).\n\nOliver also goes after a whole bunch of people that are not even involved. He even goes after Sen. Cassidy (R-LA) who did not propose a replacement bill and has not been relevant to the debate. He also includes a video of Bill Akins who is just a chairman of a Florida county's Republican party as if he is relevant. The commercial was paid for by American Action Network which just promotes center-right policy and is has no involvement and just glomming on for fundraising efforts probably. Most of the clips are just the worst clips that Oliver could cherry-pick and have nothing to do with the actual debate or plans.\n\nHe also talked about ACA flaws for about 1-2 minutes and goes incredibly easy on Obama's keep your plan and doctor lie.\n\nI thought this piece was very poor in providing an accurate view of potential replacement plan and seemed to be more of a hit piece against the GOP.
I was asking the same thing. Why should we be so concerned about not provoking a country that has clearly been provocative?
I know, right. I really dislike the people who yell over to their friend about the mythic they opened.
I think you are confusing the purpose of the risk corridors. The temporary risk corridors were "intended to promote accurate premiums in the early years of the exchanges by discouraging insurers from setting premiums high in response to uncertainty about who will enroll and what they will cost." They were temporary cost control measures until the actual pools could be determined and measured. The premium increases seen are the adjustments to the pool's risk. They are happening much faster because the risk corridors were unable to self-fund. The plan was that they would be funded by the insurers who were making money. Only $362 million was contributed compared to $2.87 billion that was requested.\n\nhttp://kff.org/health-reform/issue-brief/explaining-health-care-reform-risk-adjustment-reinsurance-and-risk-corridors/
That assumes the problem with the ACA is a lack of competition. The ACA has problems with its risk pools and rigid rules. If private insurance companies are fleeing the exchanges due to losses, why would a public option be different? Would it just be tax payers subsidizing the loses of the public option?
As long as the EPA exists with its current mission statement and its head determining policy direction, then I disagree with him being head and his position is relevant. I understand the argument for abolishing the EPA but that is not close to happening yet. I am fine with changing the system, but we must work within the current system we have been given in the meantime.

It seems like the sequel that no one wanted to make but the execs at the studio forced due to Westworld being good. I think the 1980s TV show Beyond Westworld carries on the storyline so if you want to experience the full Westworld franchise then it is worth it.\n\nSide note: One of the things I found interesting about the original was that they described the malfunctions as a disease. Today, we would use the term virus but it had not been popularized at that time. Westworld is one of the first examples of a computer virus used in fiction (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_virus#First_examples)

Trump never appears in the manifests Epstein made. The only evidence is a statement from epstein's brother that Trump was on it. Trump actually answered Virginia Robert's attorney's subpoena voluntarily. The attorney said it was obvious trump was not involved in the illicit activity and withdrew it.

The risks are about the same but people were mostly concerned with where the pipeline was going to run and the type of oil it was carrying, tar sand oil.

I think madbum faced at least a couple more batters too, that's gotta count for something.
Our fanbase is grasping at straws here because that's basically our options.
Christian Ponder was the best looking QB on the field yesterday, probably for both teams.  Sure was playing against third stringers so it probably doesn't really mean anything but it was nice none the less and it may have earned him a back up spot somewhere.\n\nWait, this is for overreaction?  \n\nPonder = GOAT he will lead us to a new dynasty and Minnesotans will gnash their teeth, they will weap and they will rake their eyes with their nails as his glory unfurls and they become aware at what they had and what they lost.
That username is fantastic.\n\nGood thing we already have a couple of chromecasts, that'll make that much easier.
Oh sorry, I just saw it didn't come up in the link search and didn't even think to look at how much Tebow crap is already on the /r/baseball.
> advisors have either been fired or resigned because of their ties to Russia\n\n> GOP has elected to stick their fingers in their ears and not do anything about it\n\nSo which one is it, has he done  nothing or has he fired people because of their ties?  
Because you want us to be *that* bad or because you legit think he's starter material?
Once again we are snatching defeat from the jaws of victory.

The foreground looks similar to a few places I've seen at Lassen, but the cliffs in the background are almost completely different than what you'd see there.
Im noticing the big difference in our offences is that they can throw and catch the ball and we can't... we should probably look into that.
Sounds like we're trying to lure the Panthers with the #8 slot from the /r/nfl thread.  
Devon Cajuste, he was a stanford guy and it's always nice seeing a local college guy transition to a local pro guy.  He seemed special at Stanford too, he was a guy whenever something went his way he did everything he could to make a play on the ball and usually did.  \n\nNow he's with the packers, which I just don't even understand.  How is their WR core so bad that they want our rejects, we have one of the least effective groups in the league, bottom 5 for sure and we can't even keep a god damn prospect for a year to see if he can get good enough to play at this NFL level.  \n\nGod I wish the NFL had a farm team system like baseball.
I'm not mad Blaine I'm just dissapointed
Everyone should take this as a lesson in the possibility of unintended consequences.  Even when you think your environmental cause is a total good it could just be that you're in the way of solving the actual problem.

Why is that surprising?  Despise him all you like, but from the sound of it he has these opinions because he was molested when he was younger.  That fucks you up a lot. \n\nBut hey he's a scumbag conservative troll so good riddance no matter how he came to these awful opinions.

Church.  I don't go every week, but when I do go I really enjoy getting outside of the house, meeting all these people, singing, reminding myself about the important things in life, and being a part of something bigger than myself. \n\nAnd afterwards, donuts.  
You can't stop it, but they can make it more difficult.  Have you ever noticed how easy it is to create reddit accounts?  That isn't an accident, it's one of the reasons this site is so popular.  \n\nOne of the best ways to combat this is to make it more difficult to create accounts, but then the website becomes less able to bring in new users, so that won't happen.  
so not only do we have to put up with shitty football.  We're about to get TD commercial, kickoff, commercial one play end of quarter commercial.  \n\nFuck the NFL.
You have to go back to how things were looking around about week 8 of last year.  Kap was sucking, badly and we didn't even know if anything was wrong with him, he didn't say anything about an injury until after he was benched.  When he was benched we saw an immediate improvement in the O-Line play because Gabbert did a better job of playing as a conservative QB, staying in the pocket, not getting happy feet all the time and making short passes fairly consistently.  He was at least keeping us in games.\n\nNow though he still  plays well with his O-Line but his accuracy seems to have tanked so that's half the reason anyone liked him at all last year.  \n\nNow the only reason I'd defend using him is because if he gets injured it doesn't cost us 16M or whatever huge amount it is next year.  
Damn, I just moved up to concord.  Bought a house for *only* around 400k, BARTing into the city only takes about an hour.  Not sure where you're at  or where you're going in the east bay but there are ways to do it in the Bay Area, you just can't be too picky....

I took a nap instead if watching most of the 2nd half.  Still am thinking that was a good decision.  You can just feel the uncompetitiveness oozing from this team.

In ancient times Islam brought a lot of new advancement into the world at large.  Math and Sciences were enriched by their thinkers and we should honor that.  However, this is very much not the case currently, they are a society that is quite frankly backwards and the left is letting them be backwards and to try and corrupt our society because of their belief that we should all be as one.\n\nThis is foolish.  Some cultures are simple better than others, some cultures deserve to die off.  The current Islamic culture that exists in the MidEast is only concerned about it's own power and ambition, it cares not for helping out it's fellows in faith, it cares not for advancing society at large, it cares not for intellectual pursuits or even camaraderie with others.  Look at how they behave in the Olympics refusing to even play sport against opponents they perceive to be unclean.  \n\nGranted there are a lot of Muslims that have come over to the first world and have adapted well they should be recognized and should be thought highly of.  But there are so many others that are not like this that need to be weened out.  They aren't just a threat of terrorism, a threat to kill our friends and family, they are a threat to our culture and civilzation.  They want to take us down to the stone ages with them.  This needs to be confronted and our leftmost citizens only want to understand and accept.  They are going to understand our enemies so much that we will end up giving up our freedoms, lives and the birthrights of our children because of it.  \n\nSorry just needed to rant about this somewhere and I live in California so there is just about no one I could find to even listen to this kind of talk in the City by the bay.
Looks like someone is upset they aren't getting a cabinet post.  
They said on there Cajuste had a chance at the roster, I was assuming he was just a practice squad body, does anyone know if he's been preforming better than that?
As an interviewer, if someone dismisses you because of a weak handshake you probably didn't want that job to begin with.
Sorry I meant 2nd round pick not 2 overall.
It means that when culture tells us something is "good" that there will soon be political will towards emphasizing it, either with laws, incentive programs or budgeting.\n\nThe conservative position is that gender = biology and that the country operates a little better when people go to bathrooms of those in their own gender.  After that a conservative really doesn't care except to say that tax money shouldn't be going towards it, it's cosmetic surgery and the people should pay for that as much as they should pay for an woman to get a boob job.\n\nPersonally I don't care that much but as much as i do, I believe gender fluidity is either nonsense or a biological disorder that should be treated with therapy not with surgery.  
It has been interpreted, and I'm not agreeing with this by the way, that civil forfeiture is essentially targeting the possessions of the accused, not the accursed themselves.\n\nPossessions have no rights as such, their rights are ignored.  
I'd love to pick up McCaffrey, but I always root for us picking up stand out Stanford guys...  Hyde is great but I have a fear that he's looking a little more injury prone than we can really trust for a long term RB that doesn't run such an injury prone style of running like Hyde does.  And McCaffrey seems a fantastic swiss army type player that I personally love.  I'd love to snag him with our #2 pick.  
That is the thing you need a good priest/pastor/whatever to make it really worthwhile.  The last one we had (and who officiated my wedding) would go off on the weirdest but most enjoyable tangents.  At our wedding his  sermon involved teaching us about how the Vulcan sign for peace from Star Trek was from a hand sign the Jewish high priests used to denote that God was speaking through them or something along those lines.\n\nYou get a guy like that you pay attention, you might be confused but at least you'll pay attention just to see where it's going.

When in doubt, assume OP is a dirty fucking liar.  
People say Kap isn't intelligent that isn't exactly true, his intelligence is fine.  His perceptiveness is what gives him huge problems though which is definitely a mental trait.  He missed wide open receivers quite often and doesn't throw balls away when he should more often then other QBs of similar experience levels.  I'm sure he could write a fine book report but that's not the type of intelligence we need here.
God damn this is just getting damn boring at this point.  Put Kap in just for a damn wildcat snap or some shit.
Oh...sure, if I see trump is dieing or is in fire...I will rush to help him. Not just trump, i may even think of saving any life eg skunk.
The only way this ends up being a good move is if we get a new head of football operations to run things for our incompetent owner.  Every other outcome and we'll be seeing Brown West Coast style for a while now and honestly I'm not sure how much of a fan I can when we have an owner this bad.  
Sorry I didn't mean *all* math and science, I mean *some* aspects of math and science.\n\nDon't completely discredit historical Muslims, they were actually ahead of their time between 800-1300AD.  You can read more about their contributions to science and then what happened afterwards [here](http://www.thenewatlantis.com/publications/why-the-arabic-world-turned-away-from-science) if you're curious.
Honestly though, that doesn't even make sense.  Why would Hillary or the DNC want this, this is the exact sort of shit that gets more independent to conservative people holding their noses and voting Trump.
I'm ditching cable, I'm not sure it's worth getting anything for just one more month of baseball.  I'll probably just be listening to the radio a lot more instead, which for baseball, that isn't a bad thing at all, but I'll miss watching it.
Thank you that is very true as well!
no one would have given us any picks worth having for Alex Smith before Harbaugh came around too.  I doubt we'll be that lucky again, but you never know what situation someone can redeem themselves.

>The best treatment, according to medical science, is to transition\n\nThe science is still not clear on that, there are a number of studies out there, such as [this one](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0016885) that establish that it actually usually does more harm than good.  
I'm here at my new home I purchased a few months back with my wife and our one month old daughter and a glass of scotch.  Not unhappy at all.  
If only Harbaugh had fired him when everyone wanted that, I wonder if the timeline would have changed and we'd still have him around.
Our 2nd string QB is a lightning rod right now and might be better than our 1st string QB.  Our new coach also hates drama.\n\nThis is going to go well, I'm sure of it.
Why is Yogg so good, is because he casts all spells as if he were the player playing him (basically, there are some that don't work like this but whatever).\n\nAll they have to do to balance him is add a roll to the beginning of each spell that randomizes which player is "playing" the spell.  If they do that it takes away all his advantages and turns him more into a hilarious youtube video machine he was built to be.

>If federal officials have their way, science students who spend their school year learning one thing (i.e., how pollution from fossil fuels creates smog) would take a year-end test based on something entirely different (like the basics of electrical circuits).\n\nUnderstanding pollution is important, but electrical circuits are probably more useful in day to day life and just as important for understanding the basics of implementable science especially as they're something concrete that students can physically play around with and "get to work".  I'm actually with the feddies on this if we can only do one or the other.

It is easy to be in a echo chamber and believe that your opponent's are weak. That's one of the reason democrats lost. Try not to take your opposition for granted. No matter how small they are, they got the asshole as president. Don't try to feel motivated by making your opponent's look small..rather work hard to make urself big....lot bigger than ur opposition.

You are right, in a formal writeup multiple periods are meaningless. However, in a conversation, it does hold a meaning . You can google and find it. I have pasted the top result\n\n\n> Those multiple periods are taken to be a single typographic character called an "ellipsis," which is used to indicate that something that normally should be there has been purposely left out. The dictionary says it is "a set of three dots (…), used to indicate that words have been omitted."\n\n\nI consider posting/commenting in reddit as conversation. 
You are ignoring the fact that horse population went down by 63%. In order for human to get universal income, the population has to go down...\nThanks (/s) to ISIS, and other terrorist group, working actively to reduce population.  My guess is rate of decrease of population is way too negative (it is still increasing) compared to technological advancement. Things are a bit out of control now....:-(

But may be you are right , at least hope so...if he gains back his self respect, it will save us a ton .

Welcome to the new world of "alternate everything". Forget all that you have learned, what you believe...Trump and his team has an "alternate" for e verything.\nTrump is "alternate honest", "alternate humble", "alternate science" guy. Actually, he is "alternate president" (read bannon as the real one).
Self centric person...what about my shoe ?
Yeah....Trump has already killed lots of civilians (women and children) in yemen. Including one of our soldier. Before pointing finger to Obama, look at your crack head leader.
I'm so amazed that u r amazed /s
The ban was just to prove that he keeps his promise. There was no eminent threat/security cable , that caused this ban. No specific terrorist was stopped by this ban and there is no guarantee, that while this ban was in place, no terrorist entered the country., This ban was not to secure american life...had it been about american life, then a bigger source of american epidemic should have been dealt with, which is 2000 times more devastating than terrorism on american soil.....that's gun control.\n\nSo this was not for love of america....this was just a personal gratification.
Believe and live in your "alternate world". Real fact is, he hasn't done anything that helps US. Signing exec order is not a big deal. But again, it is too early , so I will let you enjoy your dream till it lasts..  😝
You can stay as long as you want and until you break law and ice agents sends you back. But, that's not the question I guess you are looking answer for. Real question is what happens if you stay longer.\n\nFor example, ur visa expires on 1st April , you continue to stay and you get a job on 10th April. Life is ok..no problem...until you try to leave and come back. The immigration officer while going thru ur docs may find that u overstayed after ur visa expired and then they will put you through more trouble/questioning etc. In extreme worst case, they won't let you in...best case, once you are able to impress them..you get in. It's a matter of luck...\n\nAnd truly, it doesn't matter what the law says 60 days or 10days or 0 days...immigration officer can/ma/will give you trouble.\n\n 
You r too serious....so we elected a president , who will provide 24x7 entertainment.

Totally agree. Its funny people think all extremes..but most of the time , they extreme on negative side. Modern science has empowered us with so many tools. If we need to worry , that should about something we don't know yet or is not real problem. (For example antibiotic resistant bacteria, or a new form of virus, meteorites shower hitting earth or even global warming )

Its not like you are  not afraid of death...but you are all ready for a painful death. Your scope of thinking is small. You can fall off steps or get stuck by lightning, worst is you may get an extremely rare form of cancer that can kill you little by little painfully. I hope you have a peaceful life, but you are talking about a possibility in future that you can't control,having health ins is for that only. So, truly given all the terrible things you are expected to encounter, paying penalty for not having insurance is a very small price.\n\nEnjoy and have fun..

Hello pinky...
Unfortunately, most of the media, subreddits, newspaper are echo chamber of left or right. It is hard to find a place for healthy political discussion. So my take is , I hear everything and connect dots, filter per my wish. However if there is any forum for real political discussion let me know 
You missed "alternative facts"
lots of negativity... :-(
You mentioned "Friendly tip" and I took it in a friendly way. After your tip, I controlled my strong urge to put (... ) in all my subsequent comments. Thanks for ur tip. :-)
U r so so correct. Fear makes people more conscious , more careful , more aware of the next thing...prepares of unexpected..and that, I think is a good thing to have to sustain happiness. However, there's a line to be drawn... If someone gets sucked up in the fear , and fails to enjoy the happy part of life...that's something one should avoid.
Which media do you refer to ? What's ur honest media ? I'm really looking for an honest media...
R u following newsmax or fox ?   I mean, i'm sure u r not located in whitehouse or someone like kellyanne who can listen to Donald directly.. u must be listening to "real news"...so, what's ur real news source ?

It is circulated directly or indirectly. If grandpa invests the money, the investment company will put it back in mkt...if grandpa buys home, the developer will reinvest that money, so it gets back into mkt. Only money that doesn't get back into mkt is "black money/money stashed under bed" and I thought we just stopped accumulating black money.
Thanks a lot, for being so nice to him...👏👏👏
U r right. I mentioned, he is a text book definition of business man. At the end of day, he increased his portfolio and is a billionaire. So, you have to say he is "successful", even if his success is on the blood of poor small businesses. I'm sure most people would hate to follow his foot steps. But, it is always good to know/learn his game plan, his attitude at the point of decision making.\n\nI still wonder, why did he decide to run for president ? Is it power or money or just a wish list (obviously, it can't be serve the nation). Why is he doing, what he is doing now (given that he was a democrat in past) ? Is he thinking, that he can sustain his presidency with this approach ? Or is he just fulfilling all the promises he made to some "dark power" that helped him get into the presidency (like bannon or putin or someone else) ? It is still hard for me to understand , how can he think so irrational ?
> This will obviously never happen...\n\nWhy ? Is there any legal reason...or you are just saying b'cos of low confidence on system ?
Send him to ISIS territory in Syria.....or just send him to syria...
I can give you lots product brands that are indian and successful. They are successful, not b'cos someone (like you) pushed people to buy indian....but due to their price, quality, packaging and marketing. \n\nIf you really love India, then stop\n saying "buy indian" rather you should ask product makers to make world class product....so that people for all natural reason. \n\nIn modern world, you can't survive with a conservative, protectionist approach...open up...you will last long.
Well , then you need to understand , how things appear on internet. It costs a lot to make quality product that is not biased. PBS/CPB has contributed a lot, to the internet and community.\n\nI admire CPB for all their great programs.\n\nBut I think CPB can survive without govt funding. It was coming...CPB knew that.
> underfocusing on healthcare\n\nThat's so wrong. They are repealing Obamacare for the benefit of 20 million who got insured under ACA and will be probably without any coverage after ACA is repealed.  /s
So he kept all his promises...great. can he retire from his position now ? 11days has been tooo long for this country...
Yep...he has that....we also call that self centric, egoist.
He may resign, as his business empire will lose steam and even though he said "America First", we all know, "America" is one of the last thing he is concerned with. He thought, he will be president and he will handover majority of decision making to Bannon, while remote controls his business. But, he is realizing, being president is too tough. He wanted, him being president will have a positive influence on his business, but that's not happening.\n\nThere is high probability, that he will hate to be impeached, so he will proactively resign. 
To me, most important thing that ant human should have to gain my interest/love/respect etc is "self respect", which this president doesn't have . He is not even worthy of a human being...
\n>SA and Turkey are essentially untouchable due to our relationships with them. Yeah. Let's ban Saudi immigration and see oil prices remain normal.\n\nSo its ok for you, if a terrorist comes through saudi or turkey. I guess, getting cheap gas is more important than saving american life. Aren't u contradicting urself ?\nBtw, oil prices has been v flat for a long long time.\n\n>There are 15 mideast countries that ban Israelis for being Israeli. Americans (as private radicalized civilian terrorists) are generally not going to other peoples' countries and killing their people. What kind of fucking question is that?\n\nWhy are we trying to be like a mid east country ? What are we trying to prove ?\n\n>Lastly. We're sovereign nations. Of fucking *course* countries should be able to control who enters. Are you seriously asking me all of these questions or are you being satirical or asking them rhetorically or something.\n\nThat's where the problem is. You mentioned "countries" should be able to control who enters. Here, the "country" is saying ... this ban is illegal. Its someone implementing ban just for personal gratification.\n\n>This isn't 1798 anymore when everyone and their brother is going on the Grand Tour and having a jolly good time gallivanting through Europe and boozing with whores. We're talking about radical islamic terrorism and keeping Americans safe.\n\n\nYeah...keep saying it 10 more times...it\n doesn't convey a valid valuable message.\n\n
Trump: What you saw on tv, reported on news were all fake news. \n\n\nKellyanne : He actually meant blah blah...people are taking it out of context\n\n\nSean spicer: No, he said he will be all americans president , and not all american's president. This proves it's a fake news.\n
Ha...ha..dumbass...with such a small brain and... this is the max u can think.
>Well they are super uneducated....\n\nR u sure ? It seems ur scope of education has been very small. Hence ur brain. Go out and learn about the world. \n\nIts a shame that people like u vote, elect people , participate in democracy. Democracy can be successful only if people are interested in real knowledge. With ur lack of knowledge....u will always end up electing wrong person.\n

>>  can give you lots product brands that are Indian and successful.\n\n>doesn't change the fact that nearly every industry is dominated by the west, mainly because of this bullshit mentality that  foreign brands are "better".\n\n>look at rayban a piece of glasses cost 5000-9000rs , its literally a piece of plastic , where as Indian brands of the same quality costs 100-300rs.\n\nThere are lots of foreign brands for glasses. Rayban succeeded due to careful marketing. Just making a product doesn't help sell the product. People don't buy things b'cos they are cheap....mostly. Especially fashion items. Brands matter and a brand is nothing but quality+marketing.  \n\n>>If you really love India, then stop saying "buy indian" rather you should ask product makers to make world class product\n\n>most Indian products are cheep as hell , people just don't buy it because of foreign brand. that's the cold hard truth. \n  \n\nPeople don't buy them b'cos they don't see the value. You can always compare khadi vs bombay dying or vimal. All are indian...but, if you ask an upper middle class guy about his preference, he will go for later two...it is pure marketing. Nothing to do with "made in India" or not.\n\n>In modern world, you can't survive with a conservative, protectionist approach...open up...you will last long.\n\n>lol go to japan and say that, if its not Japanese its trash there. Japanese don't trust forign brands, same with south korea , you will look like a idiot if you walk around with  a huawei brand there.\n\nEven I (and sure lot of others) trust japanese brand....b'cos they have quality. You can apply same argument....japanese buy japanese for good quality and indians buy foreign brand due to good quality/branding.\n \n\n
>You mean like Trump fixing our inflated healthcare prices? \n\nFixing...how ? I haven't seen anything has been implemented yet or that inflated healthcare price has been fixed. Do you have any "alternative" fact that u can refer me to ?\n\n> Or maybe the fact he's forcing companies to relocate inside the US and create jobs? \n\nFord, carrier already mentioned their decision has nothing to do with trump. Do you have any news source where it confirms  trump forced these companies to relocate back in us ?\n\n> And the fact that he's pushing pharmaceutical companies to lower the price of medicine? \n\nYeah, I saw him requesting companies to make meds cheaper...great effort... ha..ha..\n\n> Not to mention i feel much safer now that he's finally enforcing stricter immigration laws.\n\nUntil someone comes to ur child's school or ur church and starts shooting.  May I know how u felt unsafe before and how u r safe now ?\n\n> He fully supports the police force, something obama never did. \n\nDo you read news ..i mean real news. How do u say " obama never did"\n....i remember obama praising police. And so many other stuff.\n\n> He actually cares about America and its citizens. \n\nHe cares about his own pocket. He is doing every thing to stay in power in conservative majority cong. This affects his pocket. He stopped immigration from 7 countries without his investment. He excluded the birthplace 9/11 mastermind....he cares about america ...ha..ha..\n\n> it's only been 11 days and I feel way better about living here than i did in the last 8 years\n\nEnjoy these eleven days...b'cos all the impacts of his decisions will follow soon and will make everybody's life hell. So next 2-4 yrs will be terrible.\n\n
Yes....they should replace obamacare with Affordable Care Act.... /s
You mean Affordable Death Insurance /s
>He's President.  That's a real fact for you.\n\nHe is terrible person, dishonest, liar, racist, sexist, makes fun of vets, makes fun of disabled...that's a real fact. He is the most unpopular president US ever had..thats a real fact.\n\nAnd he's also fulfilled most of his campaign promises in less than a week.  More than I can say for most of our past Presidents. \n\nWhich promise did he fulfil , mind explaining ?\n
Buddy, try to understand.. this trump guy, is too deep...and I have a feeling, his reactions are his acting (at least some of them). He loves being discussed, whether good or bad. B'cos every time  he is discussed, its a free marketing for him. But truly he doesn't give a fuck to SNL. He reacted past SNL , so that people can discuss about him. He is a businessman....probably a text book definition of a businessman. He took a chance with slight hope of adding value to his business (directly or indirectly). He even doesn't give a fuck to this nation or the world. He thinks he can buy everything...if required, he will buy SNL and shut it down...These are all my guess..Let's see how it goes for him...how long he survives...lots to learn..
What if pence  is also impeached ?

Thanks a lot for the input. WIll check ID shield
Ditch ur habits, lack of self control...not phone. This question should rather go to r/selfimprovement\n\nYou think by ditching ur smartphone phone, you will be able to escape the outcome...but , consider this, u have developed a bad habit and  if you fail to kill ur bad habit at its root, next time you won't have the option to ditch anything, to escape the outcome. Bad habit is like a bad infection...kill it at source.\n So, I suggest keep your smartphone and keep ur promise you made to yourself and be strong. It's just a phone and you can do it.
Thanks..that's a wonderful advice. I truly appreciate you spending time to respond back. We are all under stress and things are changing fast. For me the change was sudden and hard for me to accept it. But, for 2-3 days I was feeling depressed and tired...Never thought I will encounter a person like you in the crowd.
oTry cinnecting dots. On one hand...Jeff Sessions , just declared that , he will reinstate use of private prisons and then this Marijuana. So, it seems, the private prison lobbyist + Jeff Session worked out a plan to keep few people rich enough....at tax payer's money.
Holy moly!!!
22% is not 100%. Stereotyping all africans as uneducated is wrong.. yes africa is  poor  mostly and education is less. But "they" are not uneducated. There are lots of africans who are super educated...you can google and find out for urself.\n
With the level of frustration we all are going through...it is ok to vent out. But good that you saw /s :-)
Yes, he's been doing this bigly
R u OP's big bro ?
Wonder what kind of business will I have to do to hire Kellyanne and make her dance on our meeting table...?
Jeez...u have guts to respond back.... 
Worst as in ?
"Fight fight fight" is good. But I think there should be a strategy..."he" is crazy...wonder, what will ACLU , DNC, moderates in Republican party be doing to stop this crack head. Any insight , guess, will be great. Simply showing up in demonstration is not going to do much damage...the key is "impeachment", and in "court".  
My view is, every human no matter how stupid he is, when he/she looks at himself, will analyze and try to correct what he/she did wrong. I'm sure he does it (at least at this age and after all his successes) and that's how he has billions...he does rectify himself. I'm amazed that all he is saying, tweeting,reacting, doing doesn't come under his radar of rectification. \n\nI mean, it is v easy to just call him "stupid" as that's what he wants all to discuss about, but there is something underneath, which we may not ever get to know. 
I was giving credit to all those who voted for him... will be happy if I find my guess is wrong 😉
U r ...if you believe in it (hell) ☺
Oh I love his face!  ❤️❤️❤️
Every time I read a story about leftists boycotting something I immediately go to that company's website and buy stuff.  I hope and assume I'm not the only one.  ❤️🐘
She looks like a little duckie to me.  What a sweetheart!
"Don't worry, bro!  I'll lick all that water off of you!"
He's completely right.  And also how cool is it that he has Twitter?  And I see Neyanyahu does too.  And don't roll your eyes. I'm a mom with grown children; I'm a little behind with this Twitter thing the kids all seem to like. 😉
I've only one time in years sneaked up on a sleeping rat, my old buddy Smough.  When he didn't wake up when I came in the room I got scared he's died and I poked him.  He jumped about a foot into the air and bit me.  It was my fault of course; I'd given him a terrible scare.  I learned my lesson. ❤️
I'm probably just being terribly selfish, and I mean that non-sarcastically.  Unfortunately I got very sick and disabled and am now on COBRA.  That ends in September, and the only ACA options available to me here in Chicago all mean I will lose access to all my current specialists and at least one of my expensive medications will not be covered.  So Obamacare will likely, literally, kill me.  Which kind of sucks.  
What a shock.  Not.
I teach at a College (among the enemy lol) and the sad thing is it's that these kids are truly afraid because they believe the garbage the mainstream media tells them.  I don't know how we can ever have unity when there is so much fear.  Personally I'm scared to ever say anything even mildly conservative because I don't want to be beaten up by a mob or have my house vandalised.
Obviously if they don't vote for her it's because they hate women.  ...I'm being sarcastic
Sorry I used photo bucket back in the old days. Do you know if there is a way for me to transfer files to a better site?  I don't know I still have all the original files... ☹️
The dog's right.  The groom will never allow you to dress him in a pink tutu and have the event professionally photographed. 
Just looking at them they look like "Snuggles" and "Sweetiepie" ❤️
I'm sorry you lost your rattie.  It's so hard to say goodbye.  ❤️☹️
I live the idea of using tubes as hanging toys.  Great DIY setup!!!
Oh that's awful 
Ha!
I don't understand when my Jewish friends (I also am Jewish) post or claim Trump is anti-Semitic.  He's the first friend Israel has had in a long time.
LOL thanks for the smile
That's hilarious.  Bravo!
Is it possible Coco is sick or has a bad leg or some such?  I was just thinking maybe she bites because getting picked up hurts?
Totally believable I'm an educator and see this BS all the time. Shameful.
This happened to me once and I called my son (who is far more an rat expert than I) and he said, "Mom.  You forgot.  They're rats.  Just feed them whatever for a day or two.  It will be fine." ❤️ Kids.
Omg PLEASE say her friend is called Bill...
If liberalism is a chronic disease, why do so many liberal kids get better after they pay their first income taxes?
It's weird because I remember this one time when Pelosi and Obama told us we all had to buy health insurance.  Does Ivanka sell that?
This photo makes me cry with happiness.  I live in Illinois and I've been starting to think my two boys are the last dumbos in the world.  So happy to see new babies coming!   ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
LOL that picture of Rush.  Ha!  But don't worry, I lost faith in the mainstream media long, long ago.
I know the Seoul virus has devastated the whole area it's terrible.   🙁 When I'm ready for new babies I assume it will require a road trip...
I izz halpin u do wurk so u can cuddlez me.
Awwwwwwwwwww...aaahhhHHHHHH!
Oh I'm so jealous!  My ratties are still too young to lie still for love cuddles!
You can't tell me we should forgive that sort of behavior because of cultural differences.  Those rioters were clearly trying to cause fear and anger.
I teach at a community college near Chicago and made the mistake of suggesting to a e-group of my fellow faculty that losing $10 million in Federal funds by petitioning to be a "sanctuary school" was hypocritical since we didn't even have the staffing to deal with one of my students who felt threatened because if her hijab.  Even though I was advocating for a Muslim student I was shortly thereafter called by student affairs and accused of being a racist.  (???) The next day one of my students inexplicably couldn't register for my class with a staff member in admissions who was on the mailing list - the first time in ten years.  At this school I've also been to a professional development class sponsored by the school where we were told, and I'm not kidding: that we had a moral obligation to teach liberal values because things Republicans say are flat out wrong.  So yeah, the centrists and conservatives among us have to stay silent.  It's a travesty.
Coincidentally I do that exact same dance whenever I see a mirror!  😉
I remember seeing an interview with Nancy Pelosi after some bill or other was passed so there would be federal funding for abortion and she said something like: "Every one should be happy now there will be less poor people!" Which reminds me of these DeadKennedy song "Kill kill kill the poor". This reminds me of that as well.  What were we talking about again? Somehow it got sidetracked...
PS: Boo can't be bothered to chase Lillekatt around until he finishes his Cheerio.  <3
Yeah I'm warming up to Trump in a lot of ways but I think he doesn't really screen himself and words just come out.  It's an adjustment from the usual politicians... You have to kind of accept he works stream of consciousness... 🙂
First, thanks for the news and CDC links.  It's a relief that the Seoul virus isn't as dangerous as there usual hantavirus, but still concerning.  The CDC says workers associated with two Illinois batteries were affected.  I live in Chicago and the few ratteries I've looked into here were just individuals who loved ratties.  So I'm wondering if the ratteries required more than one "worker" is that more likely to be feeder breeders or pet store chains?  I couldn't find a link that listed affected ratteries.  \n(I've had Salad and Boo for six months; it sounds like only 8 weeks is the quarantine duration. Phew.)
I would definitely watch more makeup videos on YouTube if there were ratties involved!
I don't understand is he saying he wants to start new wars or just win the ones we are already embroiled in.  Do you have a primary source for the quote?
Omg so cute!!!!  Please tell me you have another rat called Eleanor!
Ugh I think it's because of the ultra feminist narrative that "all men are rapists by default".  
Cortana!  Sierra117 sends his love. ❤️
I am 52 years old but I would make the pilgrimage to Disney if there were an animatronic Trump.  Worth the price of admission just for the surrealism.
I think so Salad must have gotten seven or eight in his mouth.  
What a sweet face!  Good luck;  I always found rat introductions really scary.  But when ya gotta do it ya gotta do it!  ❤️
...with rodents of unusual size? 😉❤️
The only drawback to rat ownership is that they live such short lives. I tell myself that the silver lining is that it gives me the chance to make a difference in more rattie lives that way.  I'm sorry for your loss and hope you soon have some new ratties to fill the hole left behind. ❤️❤️❤️
I'm sorry you aren't feeling well but I can agree wholeheartedly that when you are so sick that you can't get out of bed the cats can keep up your spirits.  ❤️
As an educated woman, physician, mother and teacher, I can say conclusively that the future will be for humans, as it has been for all time, about half-female.  Unless women start having babies made out of 2 eggs, then it might be all female after the devastating Gender Wars of 2041.  Or, if someone can figure out how to grow babies in tanks out of spermatazoa and monkey eggs, then it might end up all male, again, after the Gender Wars.  But yeah...  probably about half-and-half. ;-)
Please tell me there is a third rat in there named "Napkins". 😉
My cat Dido is also fascinated with the potty; I had to get a gentle closing lid so it wouldn't bonk her head
You are going to love this cage.  Soooooo much easier to clean and tons of room for ratties!
You are so right about the short memory of the masses and short attention span of most. So right. \nPS:  What a relief.  Mature discussion with normal people.  I just found you, Reddit/r/conservative, thank goodness. \n
Ohhhhh so cute!
Omg that's so cute!  I suppose he didn't get too far when they asked him to count backwards from one hundred. 😉
I had same problem.  Finally I just had to wrap each patient up like a burrito and squish the end of the syringe (no needle of course!) into that space in the corner of its mouth.  It's nice if you can get help.  Or maybe you could have a veterinary technician show you the trick to doing it quickly and safely.
So what exactly is your question? Svensk eller norsk?
I would argue that the home-based breeders I've met have been true rat lovers and I've been told today that ratteries that have been found even one sick animal have had ALL of their rats destroyed.  Of course those animals are also those breeders beloved pets.  This is such a tragedy;  my heart is broken for the people affected.
Have you tried washing her?  Maybe she got OK not something weird.  That being said, I'm terribly allergic to one of my cats and not the other.  Maybe it's just genetic diversity?  Maybe you can give your doctor or a vet a call next week to investigate further.  🙁
No they are right.  Soccer is way more important than slavery and terrorism.
The best!  ❤️
I feel like this needs a hashtag like : annoyedcats 😉
The answer is yes.
As Barbie once said, "Math is hard.". 😉
I love Ben Carson.  Pediatric brain surgeon from Johns Hopkins.  He's the one conservative the left can't dismiss as "stupid" or an "idiot", as they do with everyone else.  He makes a valid point.
That doesn't help.
Molon labe!
Oh little sweet faced tortie!  All hail the mighty torties!  ❤️❤️❤️❤️
I'm assuming those are people who require brain surgery.   😉
This is true.  Also I'm a female.  🙂
Yay!
I love this photo; the lighting is perfect on your beautiful models!  
Well that's something you don't see every day.
That's a fantastic shot.  The perfect moment!
Is that supposed to make us want the wall built less or more?  I can't tell.  
Yep they just appear as a cat shaped void on film.  
This actually made me say "Aww" out loud.
You know, and I'm not advocating violence in any way, but it seems to me that if it ever came down to armed conflict in civil war that the Conservative side would probably own more and be more facile with guns.  Just saying maybe they need to back down a little on the violence and violent rhetoric before some overeager folks on the right decide to defend themselves.
Well that doesn't help.
So is freedom of speech not a thing in Sweden?
I think it is hopeless to find unbiased news, because all news is written by humans who can't help themselves.  I look at BBC for liberal world news and Rush Limbaugh for the right US news and I figure the truth is somewhere in between.  🙂
Nowadays it seems anything goes but I think most sane people find pedophilia horrifying.
Sweetie!  Is that a dumbo rat?  So cute!!!!
As a concerned cis female, I would be 100% supportive if men want to march on Washington wearing crocheted penis hats.  Or no pants.  Or both!  😉
Didn't we spend the last 50 years getting RID of segregation?!?!?!!
I'm so sorry you are affected by this.  I am praying for you and your ratties.  I know the CDC takes drastic actions when they find infected animals.  Know you are in my thoughts and prayers.  <3\n
I don't get why folks label Trump as an anti-Semite;. He clearly loves Israel AND Ivanka converted to Judaism.  He has Jewish grandchildren for goodness sakes.  Anyway I have Jewish heritage and I've never ever heard him say anything anti-Semitic.  
Blair Witch!!!!!
Awwwwww Domino is an adorable name! ❤️😊
That's no cat that is a guy in a suit! 😉
My experience is that cats offer far more affection and loyalty than any human partner.  
Me too!  Thank you!
Spider-Rat, Spider-Rat, does whatever a Spider-Rat does...  ❤️
"You want me to hold it up?  Okay?"
Also happened to my rats and the vet suggested putting a bell on the cat so the rats could hear her coming.  Everything is okay now.  
We have all been there, my friend!  
Are you the original owner of your Mac? I used to replace peoples' SuperDrives often at my Mac repair shop-- I can see that being a tool an aftermarket repair person uses to keep things aligned (those drives are absolutely terrible at maintaining stabilization when they spin.) Honestly wish I'd known this trick then! If you bought it from Apple but refurbished, their refurbishment technicians use various techniques they've learned from doing aftermarket repairs as well.\n\nIf this was a brand new computer straight from Apple, then I haven't a clue, but really interesting!\n\nedit: Just asked an ex-Apple technician friend if this was a common practice in their refurbishment roles. His response: "Yes, mostly on the 15" 2010s cause their optical drives made a whirling sound at startup"\nSolved!
So he asked for help with his onslaught of mental anguish, and... ?\nWe told him he's probably fine and sent him away? \n\nI know our mental health system is bad, but seriously, how does this happen so often? The Newtown Elementary shooter also tried several times to get help for his mental illnesses weeks before the attack, and they told him he was fine too. These people are verbally expressing "I fear I might do something crazy." We need to stop telling people who know they're not fine that they're probably just imagining it. The lives he took are not just in his head. That alone should make dealing with these people immediately a real priority.
I came in here to recommend you part it. Yes!
If this did happen, I'm sure it would go viral and there would be an uproar about the employee not being fired outright. That's a bad look, even for a long-haired millionaire.
Anyone else wish we could see more non-party politicians in general?
He leaned forward to catch his balance on the wall. I've done this too, only not as hilariously.
The video linked here is not the original-- it's a re-upload by a leech who (presumably) added highly opinion-based, inflammatory text overlays to the original video, in an obvious ploy to get views. They did not put forth the effort to actually conduct this investigation-- [France 2 did](http://www.france24.com/en/20161219-focus-france-women-suburbs-low-profile-discrimination-gender-segregation-cafes).\n\n[Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1uKobSevmbQ) is the original, which is what should be posted elsewhere if you really want to share what's happening. Giving credit and views to the people who spent time and resources investigating this real issue is how we can ensure these kinds of reports continue. We need them to continue.\n\nPutting the extra two minutes into finding the real video is worth the effort, and results in more rational discourse. Just something to keep in mind.
This could take the top spot over at r/sadcringe. Jeez.
I think most of us live in some kind of bubble of isolation from how life really is. This person makes theirs obvious.
If he means we have an out-of-control GDP, can't argue! We must be doing *something* right.
That's his point, bro. He spent his riches on the shades, so his tires are discount. Priorities.
Furthermore, when someone agrees to pose for a picture with you, putting your hand on their shoulder or upper back will generally not present a problem. The issue (for me as a woman, anyway) is an uninvited hand in the midriff or around the hips. That's too close for comfort if there is no indication of permission.\n\nSeeing the hover hand in a picture of someone next to me makes me feel pretty weird as well-- it's almost like an obnoxious little brother's louder-than-necessary "I'm not touching you!" Pictures last forever, and that one makes me look like a cold person who explicitly asked not to be touched (I'd never do that btw).
I remember thinking of text signatures as an old person thing. Like people who sign all of their facebook comments with their name, totally unnecessary but a relic of the older generation, I think.
What grinds my gears the most is that Mnuchin almost certainly believes he must have a knack for this banking thing. His collection of failing lenders practiced the same illegal and irresponsible foreclosure methods as the largest banks in America, but because the "big four" were excessively more publicized, his OneWest operation went unnoticed while he quietly sold it off for a massive profit.\n\nIn the banking world, that probably makes a guy feel pretty on top of his game, professionally. It's a damn shame he'll likely accept this offer, truly believing that he is serving his country with a skill he figures he must have. In reality, he got lucky because he didn't get caught, and he sold it all at just the right time. \n\nI don't want to see what that looks like on a Treasury level. I can only assume that his flavor of "less banking regulation" is the kind that destroyed our economy less than a single decade ago. This is what happens when we don't teach truth to power through federal prosecution-- this guy would be better off if he had learned a lesson from his mistakes. He now believes he hasn't made any.
This is important too. While I'm really happy OP is finding peace again, I'm adjusting to life without meds for the first time in 9 years, and I couldn't be happier. Each part of our journeys are unique, and there are positives to both medicated and unmedicated ADHD. For me, I am happy to leave behind the socially-damaging side effects of constant chemical stimulation, but I'm fortunate to have the drug available for the right moments.\n\nMore power to you, OP! Congratulations, and I hope you enjoy some awesome successes :)
I keep reading sources that say they've determined it's not the heat, since switching the electronics off immediately results in their lack of interest before the heat has a chance to dissipate-- but we still don't know, so that might also be wrong.
This is especially true for C-language programmers. We want to control your fucking memory allocation right down to the byte and there is nothing you can do about it oh god :,(
Yeah, I'd probably just mentally note that you're a pen enthusiast. I can relate to that.
With the right mixture of medication (which I had to cut down to an extremely small amount in order to have control over its socially-ostracizing side effects), and being outgoing (we're good at that!) and open about my ADHD and what that really means, I've found a dream career I never thought I'd be able to learn, in a company whose executives find my ADHD more fascinating than a liability. They are eager to see me succeed because they get that this thing is real, it's a massive struggle, but it comes with many benefits any company would be lucky to benefit from.\n\nKeep your confidence is my best advice. Sorry if this sounds rambly; I'm up past my bedtime. But I wanted to share that knowledge because the moment I stopped loathing myself for things I couldn't control, the more control I had over my life. We can really do anything, if we're honest with ourselves.
Butter is fat, which is high in calories per gram. If he is not in ketosis and his body is primarily digesting carbohydrates for energy, that unused fat-based caloric intake is probably going to become body fat, and obesity does lead to the conditions you describe.\n\nSo not directly, but it will make him fat.\n\n\n\n---\n> I should note that I'm in the category of people who think we got it wrong on saturated fats in the 90s and 2000s, and they do not deserve the demonized reputation we've given them. There are many outliers, like entire groups of people who eat extreme amounts of pure coconut oil daily, (the most saturated fat-laden oil known to man) and have an especially low incidence of heart disease compared to a variety of other groups. We do not have the whole picture, but many disagree with that statement.
I think you're really confused about what "most people think". I'm happy that you've never had to personally experience sexual assault or rape, but you have this estimation very wrong. Being raped is a wound that never, ever heals. Being raped as a child is a thousand times worse than that. \n\nMost people who understand the permanent, everlasting severity of child rape would gladly accept most penal punishments over that kind of lifelong psychological damage. I think that's a fairer assessment, but you're welcome to disagree. I just don't want you to accidentally represent yourself as an awful fucking person if you simply don't understand this.
After checking with a friend from Apple's refurb department, this was indeed a common repair practice when installing optical drives in the 15" 2010 model, since they have a tendency to wobble on boot.
🙏thank you!
I wasn't putting forth a price point or anything like it-- I just know my hardware and I expected an upgrade the likes of C2D > i5, etc.
This should have ended before the black bar of extraneous text. In fact, this should have just been dialog, and it would have at least made feasible sense.
You have been banned from /r/politics
"Impairment was concentrated among adolescent-onset cannabis users..."\n\nI knew I'd seen this study before. It's specifically regarding pot smokers who start as kids, before their brain is fully developed. Those of us who waited until full-grown adulthood can rest assured that no evidence yet exists that we share in these declines. I'm open to future studies, but this one is particularly cut-and-dry.
No, she wasn't.
Probably true. Part of me wants to believe he's just a down-on-his-luck electronics enthusiast.
Is it like "The Universe" that makes up WWE fans? I hear that term is used less-than-politely behind the scenes.
They've been trying to do that with nations for years-- we're especially good at breaking things (governments, young minds), but not so great at rebuilding them. 
I often just start playing chords I know, find what makes me feel something, and start singing out loud what I'm feeling. It usually comes out best when I find some variation of a chord I haven't tried before-- it makes new thoughts come out that I haven't verbalized before either.
Isn't it basically just a roll of extra-extra-thick aluminum foil?
I used to wear men's skinny jeans from H&M daily until I saw a pic of me in the front row of a group photo... the men's crotch bulge is real, built-in, and (at least in my case), super obvious whether you have something there to fill it out or not.\n\nStill wear men's jeans sometimes, just with that in mind. I'm thinking of asking a tailor if there's anything they can do to remove it.
Not even. The 99c store sells fully-functional universal remotes. One dollar.
You just reminded me that Macs haven't had optical drives built in for a few years now. This is probably an aftermarket/refurb trick since it's an older model and has likely been opened before for one reason or another.\n\nedit: \nJust asked an ex-Apple technician friend if this was a common practice in their refurbishment roles. His response: "Yes, mostly on the 15" 2010s cause their optical drives made a whirling sound at startup"\n\nSolved!
I have severe depth perception insecurity which makes me too afraid to drive in my large, traffic-filled city. I work in games and have never once considered this. I think I may buy a Vive in 2017 and see what happens. Thanks for sharing!
I've fallen once because I tried to lean on a wall briefly that wasn't actually there, to balance myself. Fortunately, only two coworkers were watching and not the entire internet 😂

Drugs like Adderall can do great things for your focus and motivation, but they can also make you a rambling motormouth in a way that's hard for you to notice in the moment. Unfortunately, other people do notice, and it took me some time to realize I could do better by taking less (my doctor wanted me on 4x what I'm on now.)\n\nThere are other physical side effects from stimulants, like no appetite (even though your brain needs even more fuel), increased heart rate, etc. Adderall is dextro-amphetamine, so pretty similar side effects to a small amount of meth, but the dextro- is there to make the whole experience a bit smoother. Still, if you choose to start, don't be afraid to stand up to your doctor if you know he's giving you too much. My older brother is on a massive amount, and it's sometimes hard to hold any kind of conversation with him.
For most complex things like a balanced budget, the answer is in finding the moderate solution by extracting the absolute facts from each sides' argument. I wouldn't call it a compromise, but I do consider that a form of legitimate moderation-based problem solving.
That's been my experience-- looking at the hardware I was given to navigate a physical world, but never quite feeling like it's "me", the same way that my car or my clothes aren't "me." They're vehicles for navigation and expression, but I'm the thing *inside* the body, doing the driving and having the thoughts.
Is it possible to obscure the awkward edges by covering them with your longer hair? Regardless, that haircut is pretty bad-- I didn't know what to expect but I was not let down. You should see a professional you trust, they may be able to accomplish something clever for your grow-out stage right on the spot. Finding a stylist who's able to do triage skillfully may cost you, but in this case I'd say it's worth it, and best of luck to you.
There's something called [body integrity identity disorder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_integrity_identity_disorder) that makes people (among other things) want to amputate certain limbs to feel "complete." It's an actual mental illness and it causes the sufferer to obsess over just getting it over with until they finally do it... unless they get help first. It all makes perfect sense in their own heads.\n\nThat's the explanation, but it's still hard as hell to watch. Especially as someone who lost a finger[tip] a few years ago myself (thankfully it reattached successfully, I enjoy having all ten).

I had a very similar reason for starting keto-- except that my medication was daytime, and suppressed my appetite until nighttime when I more-than-recovered the lost calories-- by about 1500 over what I should have been eating. I love that keto still allows you to eat high calories if you really need to, as long as they're not sugar calories. Great for your teeth too! I recently learned that s. mutans, the bacteria strain responsible for dental cavities, *only eats carbohydrates.* 
From the comments:\n>Just checked out this story out and it appears that these were Golden Corral execs that came not health inspectors and they deemed these meats to not be good and told management to throw them out. This kid's dad made him shoot the video in order to sell it for thousands of dollars, but their is a grain of truth to it because I guess the manager was pissed about the execs coming and had mentioned keeping it in trays to use after they left or something. So the manager was fired.﻿\n\nAnyone know if that's true? I find it more likely that they were embarrassed and made some kitchen worker rush the carts out to the dumpster area to dispose of when the execs left. I've worked at a dozen fast food restaurants and there is literally no reason to store meat intended for use in the worst of a dozen available hiding spots (if you're storing meat outside refrigeration, which is not a thing you do regardless, but I've seen it happen.)

You aren't going to know what's going on if I invite you over to make food together? This is serious? I think that's pretty silly, tbh. If I want you to come over so we can fuck, I'd be pretty intently gesture-driven in that request. Winks, Netflix mentions, whathaveyou. But your assumption that it must be sex is pretty misguided.\n\nMaybe she invited you alone and then got nervous and invited her girls. The point is, leave your pretense at the door and you won't make the mistake of looking like an entitled dude only interested in sex with that person.\n\nMaking that huge leap is unfair to the person who invited you to be a part of her life in some respect. You should hold off on making that *vast* assumption until you have any sort of further evidence that's what's happening. Otherwise, you're going to end up resenting someone who genuinely wanted to spend time with you without pretense-- and that is not her fault. It certainly made me lose a lot of hope in a few males in my life who appeared to be incapable of human friendship when it was all laid on the table.
Propaganda would be the aspects of each sides' argument that do not contain facts, so they would be discarded. If you're left with one tiny little fact from each side that's actually true, they're still worth using. My point is that in US politics, both sides are often very wrong, but they also possess facts the other side may not because of their differing perspectives on life in general. ie. A left-wing legislator who passes banking regulations without learning the absolute facts from pro-banking right-wing legislators (with knowledge of the industry), will likely come up short in their "solution" to reel in the financial sector.\n\nEven if side #2 seems vile and uneducated, they likely have at least one indisputable fact in their worldview that side #1 must know to execute a working solution to that problem. Extracting those facts is something our own legislators seem to still have an *impossible* time doing.\n\nWhenever I see the argument that moderatism is a farce, I have to bring that point up. We have been making the same mistake for more than a century in the way we draft and pass legislation, and it's led to partisan division that brings us even further from a solution. It would be nice to see a change in that system that considers absolute facts with absolute equality, no matter where (or whom) they come from.
Same. No idea what it's doing here.
"The American Paper for Americans"-- we were so proud of ourselves then. I wonder what that felt like.
I would differ on that-- pleasure is not a chemically complex experience. It seems that every living thing has a chemical release capacity when they encounter positive stimuli-- even plants have chemical responses to being watered that aren't much more complex than the experience we call pleasure.

I asked a fashion designer friend this when I was about to just switch to buying men's jeans for the pockets. She said that larger front pockets on tight-fit women's jeans add an awkward looking bulge, and they have so far found no way to make it look right. It's on us, ladies. There HAS to be a way.
I'm an omnivore and my partner is a vegetarian, former raw vegan for almost 20 years. I was a little taken aback by that at first, but he never once passed judgement on my meat-eating habits (when we met I was pretty much on a steak-every-night diet). But as he's opened me up to the world of alternative meat, I realized recently that I don't eat much meat anymore if I have the option to cook this science meat and make the whole family happy. I still enjoy a good steak, but my state is in a drought largely due to agricultural malfeasance like irresponsible cattle rearing. It's nice to have a whole category of vegetables that taste like meat/a main dish that I can work on cooking to perfection, especially since I never used to eat enough vegetables. He's also sort of inspired me to give a shit about things, i.e. I switched to bison steak since they're native and sustainable in the US and all that jazz. I can't say his activism never taught me anything, but I sincerely appreciate that he's never once cast aspersions on my carnivorous decisions. (At least that I know of)

This was no doubt sparked by some minority of customers calling them "not vegan enough." The infighting in that group is often worse than the outfighting. I know a good number of vegans who are constantly being shouted down by "TRUE vegans" for perpetuating exploitation in ways like this-- totally baseless and self-righteous gatekeeping does not look good on anyone, nor does kowtowing to it. You will never be "_____ enough" to people like that.
Most modern Mormons do not practice or support polygamy. The small ultra-traditional sect that does is distinctly identified as separate by most modern LDS followers.
I went too deep finding this actual tweet exchange. The Caps twitter asked people to post faceswaps, and they were making fun of the fact that she did not do that.
haha shoot I'm sorry, my friend answered ten minutes after I got an answer here. It didn't seem to have a smell, and while it tasted pleasant, it did not taste familiar. I need to improve my herb game!
It happened at a restaurant in a bathroom door. It was a severed fingertip rather than the whole finger, just where the nail ends. It was absolutely my fault, but it was pretty mortifying to have that happen around where everyone was eating their food-- I tried to hide it until I got to the hospital.\n\nHere are the gory details if you're into that stuff:\n\nIt got caught in the hinge, the door latched shut, and my fingertip was clean cut off all the way through to the cuticle, hanging by the nail. \n\nI went to an awful hospital that made me pee in a cup (while holding my finger together) to ensure I wasn't pregnant, made me wait for 3+ hours in a hospital bed, and finally a doctor came and confirmed via X-ray that it was shattered inside and the nerves were mostly severed. She numbed my whole hand and used my detached fingernail as a sort of splint since it was jammed in there already. She tucked the dead nail back in under the cuticle and sewed right into it. She stitched it up all the way around and told me we'll just have to see if the rest of my finger accepts it. \n\nI guess I just got lucky with how it healed. I still can't feel much on that fingertip unless I press really hard, but the nail grew in nicely and you'd never know it had ever been severed just by looking. It took about a year for it to look alright. I documented the healing process in this [charming video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__uYY9VFgr4).
I tried everything there was before I landed on Adderall in 2009. Now there's Vyvanse, but there won't be a generic for several more years, so I'm not sure how people can afford it. It looks like it'd cost more than $200/ mo on my insurance, but I'd really like to give it a try.
I'm curious as to how you ended up on this sub?
Seriously give blow-drying a try if you can. Adding a small amount of body will give your hair a fuller look. And definitely lose a good few inches of the back length like others said.
Their response was something along the lines of "that was the joke ;)", but who wouldn't say that even if they did get caught, haha.
She's angry- not afraid, not offended. Just plain angry. We know that feeling well.
All incredible titles. Enjoy it!
See, I actually do think Tim Cook is a nice guy. I think that he thinks he's doing an incredible job, and the people around him confirm constantly that he's changing the world for the better with his philanthropic efforts, etc. \n\nBut that's often the case when a CEO starts making wrong moves-- it's because no one around that person is being honest enough. Leaders need critical people around them who aren't afraid to be perfectly honest, and I wouldn't be surprised if he's lacking those.
We have a guy at my company who famously dedicates a full slide within nearly all his presentation decks to a self-quote. It's obviously done tongue-in-cheek, and while not everyone finds it amusing, I totally do.
Apple charges for all their software now-- iLife (as it were), iWork (again, former title), all of those cost money now.\n\nAlso, I totally agree that software developers need to be paid-- I am one! But if printers stopped including USB type B cables because everyone had them lying around, that's certainly not the case with USB C cables at this juncture. There's pushing for the future, and then there's forced obsolescence-- $75 ought to get me the whole damn thing.
I know we don't know a lot about the exact reasons, but I've always figured in some aspect of the current stimulating their nervous system in a way that must be somewhat pleasant-- it seems like when you shut off the current, they lose interest and exit if they have the option.
I have the anger version of this. It's extremely embarrassing, especially because I like to tell myself I'm a person who keeps her emotions pretty well under control. I have done some really shameful, angry things in response to my SO implicating me or my actions in his own internal pain.\n\nI wish there was an effective treatment option listed that didn't entail either of those medications. I'm already trying to quit Adderall because it makes the rage even stronger.
The part where he mentions his own mental illness-- he's completely aware of it, just hasn't found effective help. That is so god damned sad.

To be fair, you were the *opposite* of scammed. The event was exactly as described!\n\nI'm a female who has been accused of this very thing, and it's fucking frustrating. If I genuinely want to include you in my group of friends, it's because I'm interested in knowing you better. Either accept my friendship (potentially as a pre-requisite to determining if I'm interested in you, potentially not) or, I don't know, accept reality. I've invited platonic dude friends to do friend-based things to get to know them better, and to hear that **they** feel scammed is absolutely insane. I got scammed, buddy. My friend saw me as a piece of ass above all else, and I got scammed. \n\nEvery imagined expectation you had was *imagined*-- and may say something larger about your own ego. Studies show that dudes are more likely to believe any female who's friendly with them must be interested. That's a recipe for feeling like a victim your whole life, but it also prevents you from getting to know any female human well enough to give yourself a chance-- which I gather was your end goal here.
This year I plan on building my first gaming PC in years. Until now I've been trying to make do running Boot Camp on my work Mac-- no more! So excited to play all the PC-only titles I've longed for, but especially excited to finally experience Life is Strange!
I appreciate your insight and explanation. I, too, support the idea that sects are invented. They lead to artificial differences that make it easier for idealogical groups (in-power or not) to leverage public ire to push their ideas. The premise is flawed, so their success is unsustainable, if not overtly harmful.\n\nBut at least one part of our (US citizens') present acceptance of these sects is based in the way we perceive the world, the experiences we've had, and the external ideas that have most resonated with that worldview. We are quick to choose a side if the words are sweet enough. If we could do away with partisanship entirely tomorrow, I'd support that 100%. But as we wade through its murkiest depths right now, I see a small benefit in using those differences (imagined or otherwise) to our advantage, in expanding the collective knowledgebase of our lawmakers and leaders. Most bad opinions (the kind we have no shortage of in the US), are the result of partial-fact, with distinct gaps of information factored in. They can be solved just as easily as filling those gaps-- but doing that effectively requires treating those without that full knowledge with as much respect as we can, so that they feel heard, involved, and begin to consider themselves as stakeholders in our process, instead of members of one team.\n\nCapitalizing on division is the irresponsible way to respond to a political schism-- celebrating those differences (even if they're imagined, they're real to those who live by them), can potentially widen our capabilities as we work to eradicate the concept of sects altogether (which I really do believe can be done in this country.) People need to feel heard before they calm down and think objectively.\n\nIt's a concept that would allow any given American to respond to scandal unequivocally with: "This legislator did an unacceptable thing, and I feel no personal responsibility to protect that person since they presented themselves as a capable leader. It is for the good of me, and my neighbor (whose life may be very different from mine), that this person is removed from a position of trust." The way we as a nation react to the destruction of trust by those in power determines the government we deserve to live under. It will benefit every one of us when the concept of artificial, fear-inspired sects is defeated.
When I was in high school, I failed math class. They put me in a remedial math class (called "math topics") that taught me how to acquire and pay a mortgage, get a good rate on a used car, and file my taxes. None of the other students in my school ever got the opportunity to learn these skills in a risk-free academic environment.\n\nEvery single student deserves to have that class available to them.
Adderall made me even more talkative than I normally am, but less aware of whether I'm chewing someone's poor ear off. I was going a million miles a minute, but that part of our brains that tells us to check up on whether we're bothering that person rarely kicked in (or just didn't work quite right). I would often find myself responding to everyone's own stories with a narcissistic angle about how that relates to my own life, whether they cared or not.\n\nI didn't realize how much empathy I was lacking while I was on the drug. It made me feel self-righteous in my indignant feelings whether I was actually right or not, like a chemically-induced rage when I sensed an injustice, even if it was just something I didn't understand. I was always the person in the room who felt like everyone else was moving and deciding too slowly, but in reality I was just being too intense. It's hard enough to relate to a room full of people when you have ADHD-- Adderall added an extra barrier between me and everyone else, because I was also essentially on speed-- and that came through at times when I wished it hadn't.\n\nThat being said, I'm learning which things I blamed on the medication were actually just inherent parts of my personality, and I'm trying to find a balance between some amount of medication sometimes, and absolutely no medication other times. I still haven't reached a consensus, but that's some of what I've learned so far.
You have to start from the beginning, just like the person who told them the lie originally.\n\nIt's frustrating, time-consuming, and requires a huge amount of patience. But if you care enough for the person you're talking to, you will find the strength to do it. And you will get through, so long as you remain calm, objective, and try to understand/repeat their perspective. All these people want is to be listened to-- they feel ignored and their indoctrination is fear-based. Reversal requires the opposite-- attention, concern, and reason to have hope again. That's what they need, and it's better if it comes from reality. It's our job to help the people we care about get there.
They should include the cable with the purchase of an adapter. That's the sale price for every other fully-inclusive adapter they've ever sold, but now it comes with less-- including the thing you need to make it work.\n\nIf frailty of the cable is a reason, they should still include an initial one included in that cost.

Voting the party line is a scourge. So many of our elected officials proudly exclaim to their constituents that they will always vote with their party, and that is outrageous to me. We don't elect people so they'll do what they're told, we elect them to represent us by thinking critically for themselves. We ought to become serious about holding them to that standard.

I'm a software developer and I've always been a Unix fangirl, so the Mac OS seemed like the perfect place for me to live my life. I still love the OS more than any other for work, but at this point I wish they would license their OS to other hardware developers. I know that's just a pipe-dream (especially since there'd be no easy way to really make money from it), but I selfishly want it anyway. I miss saving up to upgrade my hardware to fit my specific needs. They took that away from us just like they took chroma-keying out of iMovie, to make it easier for lowest-common-denominator users to navigate. It left me bitter.\n\nOn the IT front, I used to work IT for an 80% Mac company, and there are some awesome fully-featured admin suites available (especially those from JAMF) that made the whole process much smoother. I was the only Mac fangirl in my department, but Casper Self Service made life easier for all of us at a time when even updating some software required us to walk over to the user's desk and type a password over their shoulder. In a tech job, that feels rightfully ridiculous.\n\nFinance was still on Windows when I left, and we never had a better solution for their machines. But at least 80% of our users were learning to be self-sufficient, and that made everybody a little happier.

I'm a software engineer. I was stuck in a loop of working IT jobs, showing up late, and feeling like a general disappointment professionally. When the opportunity to change careers within a company I did IT for arose, I applied expecting to fail. It was the hardest thing I've ever done, but in 12 weeks I was on the job and it's such a great profession for my ADHD. Being late is more acceptable and common in software engineering, and instead of being scolded for trying to find new ways to do things, I'm encouraged to do just that. I highly recommend trying out software development for any ADHD'er who's ever thought about it. The pay is also much nicer than the hardware field in most cases.
Like I said, it took me 12 weeks through a boot camp. They're expensive and I lucked out by having my company foot the bill, but these programming boot camps are becoming more common, and more respected on the job. They are miracles for those of us who continuously got kicked out of college and never finished (me.)\n\nBarring that, starting courses on free sites like [codeacdemy](http://codecademy.com) will give you a taste of a dozen+ languages and their syntaxes so you can see what interests you. If you learn enough online and write your own programs (for whatever purpose you want), you can show that code to a prospective employer to prove you know your stuff. I strongly believe that people with ADHD have the ability to write code in a creative, effective way that may not exist yet, and I'm fortunate to be in a programming environment with a few other ADHD-minded folks to toss ideas around with. Our creativity is definitely our strength in this industry.

I feel I answered your followups already in my previous posts. \n\nTaxes aren't directly supply and demand based but if millionaires will buy homes, condos, apartments, land, etc and use it 20%, what does that matter to NJ if they are working families or Chinese billionaires buying stuff for fun? Checks still come in from escrow every month. \n\nThis sounds like hyperbole but it's not.
People don't understand the point of this sub or their complicity most of the time 
As soon they do the same  with Trump's
You first 
That's your fault for believing polls and talking heads with a narrative to push 
Serious question\n\nWhy not ask a bodega for some change?
I hope you're not referring to Flynn because if you are all of your credibility goes out the window
Dude the whole reddit system is a sham of free speech \n\nIf you hit a low enough threshold of points in a sub, aka unpopular opinion, you get relegated as a second class citizen with post restrictions and time limits. \n\nI can't even post it my own states sub anymore because I got brigaded one time. \n\nI got banned from socialism for speaking out against the violence they are trying to incite \n\nI got banned from geopolitics for saying Obama and the state dept funded terrorists (fact) \n\nI got banned from late stage capitalism for speaking out against their violence as well and susceptibility to memes and a hive mind\n\nReddit is purposefully using this system to quiet dissent within communities and create echo chambers 
You mean the report(s) where facts and evidence were not included?
petrodollar is key and i'm so glad to see someone, other than me, bring it up in conversation re: USA and Obama
Can you smell stupid too? We can....
A counter argument to women being the reason for the collapse of society? \n\nNo thanks \n\nThis fits into the pinned topic on this sub. 
Hyperbole? Allegory?\n\nThat's how humans talk. Just saying. 
I didn't vote based on ONLY marijuana \n\nThat would be idiotic 
bernie changed the whole election - he forced Hillary AND trump to talk about income inequality.\n\nit wasn't until he blew up and started getting the attention he deserved that hillary did a 180 and changed her stump speech to mimic his. 
Have you seen any yet? This has been going on since summer 2016. 
> So my question is; are you happy with what has happened so far? Do you think that his contributions to your country are net positive?\n\n No \n\nThanks for asking and engaging. I said I voted for Trump, I never said I support what is going on now. No one cares though and it's a dangerous mindset. 
thanks for the insight - i learned from it. 
Are you purposely acting stupid or are you putting on a front in hopes that we will engage you further?
But I thought he was a Russian puppet 
It is when you are talking about the NYSE and SNAPCHAT, an American company
In what way 
Their terrible critical thinking skills\n\nEvery single person who downvoted me obviously can't think critically
Hahahaha You thinking there is *good* and *bad*. 
Only cause she brought Ebro in it and Rosenberg is fanning the flames \n\nJust my opinion as someone who resides in NYC metropolitan
Cool? 
Capitalism just allows it to be hidden. They are all on the state's payroll 
Nice try FBI
Internet outage?
For starters \n\nAvoiding any chance at talking to anyone OUTSIDE a controlled environment. He hasn't had a town hall since 2013 but has invite only conference calls routinely. \n\nWhen you really take the time to research him, his name, and his connections it's not outlandish to say he is one of the most powerful congressman who hardly uses that power for anything outside of personal gain
You can't look at percentages in a vacuum \n\nWho was he running against? Did they have his money? Name? Were they already sitting congressman? \n\nIt's far easier to be REelected by the uniformed electorate than it is to be ELECTED while running against multi millionaire from a political dynasty 
Sounds like you 🤔
Wait so voting = treason? \n\n
What the fuck 
Stop using Zionist and you're good to go
Impossible when capitalism runs the market and we live near the so-called center of the world, NYC
Eggs? Fuck ton of damage?\n
...This is how high quality torrents are released \n\nWhat world are people in where multi part rars are abnormal?
This. They are super powered to us humans. 
Yet again, another person who doesn't or can't read then attacks something no one is even taking about

Yeah they aren't coupons\n\nCostco includes the manufacturer discount on the display price and the mail is just "hey check out this wild price!!"
Since you say you just turned twenty, can I ask if you frequent /r/trees? \n\nI posted there about how not all Trump voters are nazi's or idiots and that there were legitimate gripes with Clinton(not pizza related) and I got every single logical fallacy under the sun thrown at me. I tried to engage and show how they are doing what they THINK Trump voters do.... \n\nDo you see others your age simply regurgitate what they read and say? I tried to stay calm but ended up blowing up once someone said they wish I get the federal minimum so I'm not allowed to vote anymore. \n\nIt's bonkers. I'm a little embarrassed by how I acted in some threads but please feel free to dive in and see what I mean regarding the other posters. \n\nEdit I am 30 BTW 
You should expand your understanding of these political parties 
Know how \n\nAnd *can execute it from an engineering and physics standpoint* are not the same though
Nicki has an ABC family show coming out right?\n\nShe isn't gonna touch this 
Valid\n\nIn my opinion some things don't deserve to be entertained and if that goes against the subreddit well then I'm guilty
Because there are things called facts and evidence?
Serious premise:\n\nWould this get anywhere near the attention if they were 20 year old white kids?
I just said this same thing in my head \n\nThen thought of the look my wife will give me when I run this documentary by her\n\n😔
Talk about propaganda jeez
It is amazing. I'm glad people like it, means we will probably get another season at least 
This is the key trend to take away here, IMO
Over dramatic? your response tells me you are talking about Flynn and that tells me you have no idea what you're talking about so therefore I'm totally in the right to undermine your point\n\nLet me ask you a question have you ever seriously and critically thought about why Russia is a long-term enemy and why going to war with Russia now again for no reason is good for the American people? Have you ever thought about that instead of reading the news?
You're an idiot \n\nCarry on 
You keep talking without saying much of anything and your defense of gerrymandering is wrong and naive. 
To get your otherwise valid point heard and understood by others you need to reign in the anti semetic rhetoric\n\nEverything else is legit, change the antagonist to globalists or just neoconservatives. Ditch the Nazi talk and people will start taking passionate Trump supporters seriously
any link provided would probably be met with \n\n"conservative garbage"\n"fake news"\n"lol"\n\ndo the research on your own, dude. \ncome to your own conclusion instead of constantly relying information to be brought, explained, and analyzed for you. 
Same. Thought I was the only one. 
It's not a conspiracy if it is happening and the reason taxes are a part of this is because there is ZERO incentive for politicians to do anything that doesn't line their pockets and the properties are still being bought and paid for....
>Why should my taxes go up because a neighboring town has been poorly managed?  \n\nIt's kind of the whole point to living in a society  with taxes and laws and distributed burdens of responsibility, no?
I'll tell you what\n\nTaboo, the TV show was so intriguing, I would love a dark gritty story about the revolutionary war/declaration of Independence\n\nAnyone with me?
The ACA is still in place though and you used it as your number one point...
I honestly don't know\n\nDo I?
I do as well.\n\nI honestly don't know why I re-subscribed recently - probably looking to engage in the jovial discourse that was common before 2016. :(
What about the run off? Into the Pacific and ground water? You can't not address the aftermath and only consider the dangers of human clean up 
And he should be in a ditch 
This is a great question and I'm glad SOMEONE is asking it \n\nFirst it's fake news, then domestic abuse/cheating, now it's Russia \n\nUs Americans are so fucking gullible.
So no one will notice the blood
So we can expect him to be on the Yankees starting the same year as harper and trout? 
Lol I don't *hate* this 
That's not what you asked though 
..... Why\n\nWhy don't you provide facts and sources instead for using your own personal, wrong, opinion \n\n~~Hundreds~~tens of millions voted for Trump. If you think we are all the same you're naive. \n\nI feel sorry for you considering I can see right through you as a person based on this simple sentence. You're shallow and can't think for yourself. You see the news and the rise of the term nazi and fascism and the violence being perpetrated BY SELECT FEW and decide to close your mind to everything that doesn't fit your mold. \n\n
maybe you should expand yours? 
I said Hillary ONCE\n\nWhat are you even saying? \n\nHow can you read my comments and say this? \nQuote me where I said Hillary more than once (and not the other post where another idiot brought it up as if the election wasn't between these two people) \n\nHow can you discuss an election without bringing up the other side? \n\nWhy don't you guys make sense? \nWhy don't you see how little sense you make? Your sentences are grammatically correct but they don't address anything and are based on fantasy world where you think my argument is about Clinton? \n\nMy point has already been proven hundreds of times over - no one can think for themselves and are attacking Trump voters without ANY real reason other than fear and hatred \n\nPlease go smoke your weed and think you understand the world better than anyone else, I don't want to hear this bullshit anymore 
I called his NJ office and said I was appalled at his absence and he should be ashamed for having an invite only *Tele Town Hall* hours prior. \n\nThe rep said I will be invited to the next Tele town hall, which means, in my opinion, he has NO PLANS TO MEET WITH HIS CONSTITUENTS IN PERSON. \n \nIf you REALLY do the research, this guy is scummy and needs to stop being voted for. \n\nHis family is a political dynasty and has money to the point he does this for fun and to further his OWN agenda instead of what HIS PEOPLE WANT. \n
Thanks for the insight
Rumors are it'll be Mike and Katie Nolan maybe

True colors
Why are they highest in the nation?\n\nBecause we live near NYC\n\nWho wants to live near NYC?\n\nPractically the entire world. \n\n\nIt's not as simple as getting your local authority to lower taxes. The money needs to come from somewhere and OTHER people are going to pay it....\n\nTherefore supply and demand, our property taxes are not going down. You will just be pushed out like many people get pushed out of cities and neighborhoods, the only difference is that the whole state is being gentrified, from North to South, and they don't care about you. They care about wealthy globalists buying property and sitting on it as investments. 
*Useful idiots*, they are \n\nI don't think it is a bot unfortunately. Just someone who can't, or is being paid to not, think for themselves
He's also the Golden Boy of the DNC and regardless of what your opinion is that should give you pause
Yeah that's what I meant, you seem to be in the states \n\nCan you take a pic? This would be big if we find various time covers perpetrating different kinds of propaganda based on location 
you're asking for a *source* that a former president was a war criminal?\n\nthe source is hundreds of diplomatic cables, essays, analysis, government documents, missions, statistics, etc.\n\nits not that easy. \n\nyou can assume i am lying, i dont care. when people dont want to learn on their own, i dont care to engage with them.

You're right, that was my bad. I knew that but extrapolated the population incorrectly. My apologies. 
As if it's super easy to go from US to any country anyway? Unless you are a doctor or from other specific industry, it's almost impossible to emigrate somewhere else. \n\nDon't give me this woe is me bullshit. America had it's doors open for decades. How about someone else step up?\n\nFuck off

Fringe groups like... the department of education ... People like Jeff Sessions. Whether you'd do what they do yourself is irrelevant of the people you select do it with you blithely indifferent approval.\n\nWas Hilary or Bernie a PC policing SJW? What were they going to do, to that end? There's no equivalency. Even the equivalency isn't an equivalency. PC policing isn't going to hurt people . . . It's also not desirable or real  
That's hundreds of people. If you don't have a positive opinion about one of them you just don't know of very many. It's just a really simple minded conclusion to come to.
That's not a "but" it's just another random fact
If I flew a lot I'd start calling them Billomats. 
It's the exact opposite of a black and white argument and I doubt you believe differently. It's a salt and pepper argument. The whole is neither black nor white.  
Looks like she got really careless with a chicken pot pie, is all 
I always hear "misrepresenting" as a pretty strong word. I can't think of a way to use "misrepresent" that would still be considered truthful.
"likely" meaning the odds are around 52:48 instead of 48:52.
Perspective. Try to attain it. You care about what lessons are being taught? Obviously not. You care about people getting hurt? Obviously not. You think Trump's motorcade is just "anyone"... Obviously not. Obvious to anyone who isn't dedicated to the task of ignoring (or hiding) the obvious.     
So pretty much every armchair general in the history of the world is more evil than an emergency responder or a lifesaver is good. I'm convinced.

It really doesn't make any sense at all . . . but it's a lot like real life. People are just fucking dumb and cruel.
Seriously... What is fucking wrong with people
A classic case of "pay attention to me I'm a victim". 
It's pretty much the same idea as Trump culture, except with hearing instead of critical thinking and fact finding. It's a matter of pride, which is more important, emotionally, than whatever potential gains are to be had.

Of course if you can build your own stingray, steal one, hack a tower, etc. etc. you can continue to do the equivalent. At least the police's hands are appropriately tied to keep them within the law for a change. End to end security is what people need. the choices are Signal, whatsapp (so far), or security theater.
I'm sure he does see himself that way, but half the fun is in never admitting it. Why would a villain tell you that he's a villain?

Honestly anyone in the majority party on the judiciary committee would probably be a very helpful voice. The Senate can't initiate, but they will be there for the trial.

Maybe the sound editor had another set of musicians fill in something to match the on screen musicians' movements.

A few more minutes and oxygen balloon would start to seem pretty unfun, too. At least with nitrous he'd die happy.
That's not what tone is. There are countless stories about people, elves, and giants going here and fighting that. Somebody dies, etc etc. The dialog is hugely instrumental in establishing tone. Even stories about (like the darkspawn) kidnapping and impregnating people can be told in a way that minimizes the human toll. Just look at history textbooks for an example. They breeze through that stuff like it was nothing.
You are literally wrong about what you say, which is not even much in common with what the other guy was talking about.
Once you have a kid, though, it's something else. Marriages used to be more like that all the time. Just one more way that the trumps are throwbacks to crueler times.

And if they didn't get to rattle off their moronic shpeil first, no one would even know their motives, just "armed assailant shot, no other victims; motives unclear, ties to militia groups"
Honestly I have never heard of anything quite as revolutionary to both being a great story and to get kids reading as Harry Potter. I didn't read it for many years after it was out, but all I heard for years is how kids are loving it like nothing else. Who can even say for how many children it was the reason they got into books, period. Before Harry Potter, if you were trying to get kids to read, it was always a guessing game . . . maybe you'll like Alice in Wonderland, or goosebumps, or the sports almanac? But since they came out, it's THE thing.
I'm not mad. I'm just disappointed.
You're making a mistake to think those things cannot coexist. A) Syria is a shit show and even though there are  more than two sides, you still don't get to pick every group that is also on yours b) if you save lives, you have been a hero. If you take them you have been a killer. They don't undo each other.
Bribing the press core. Bribing. smh
This is one of those movies that was more about the journey, for me. I don't think of it as very spoilable. I agree in principle. I just don't want anyone to think it wouldn't be worth watching just because they know so much about the conclusion (compared to, say, an M. Night Shamalyan movie that might be just tedious in such a situation) \n\nIt's a very beautiful and honest story that doesn't sugar coat life's complexities. The best type of sci-fi.
I wonder if the painter went up in a balloon, or just sort of winged it from what was known
The very name Russia comes from their foreign ruling class, the Rus, meaning red, because they were basically Vikings or something.

It's funny how many weirdoes post crazy disinformation on reddit. A couple years ago I might have realized you were just talking about the other post, but people just talk like it's opposite day all the time now and my guard is up so high. I'm sorry I didn't give you a little credit. It's something I lost in Trump's information war and I hope to have it back some day.
Hah! For a second there I thought it was some kind of silicon valley neologism, trading stock for advertising dollars or clicks, some kind of weird arrangement. I was already mid eye roll when I realized it must just be a typo.
This has got to be about the head trauma at this point, because he is clearly the most dangerous criminal I've ever seen reported on reddit and not to the police, by far. You never said you wanted your head bashed in, that's not what you agreed to. 
Anyone recognize the punk girl? She looks really familiar but didn't have any lines and wasn't credited
I may finally remember that guy's name now that I know what a balaban is. The broad city episode he was in, with Jeremy and the fake bags and the shiva was legendary.
It's that "if" that makes the difference. Trump is working to turn it into a "when" whereas most leaders pay lip service to truth telling, separation of powers, abiding corruption and the appearance thereof, etc.
It has NOTHING to do with racism!! It's about smashing people's heads!
I hate to say it but maybe that's just a flaw in the system. It's not optimized to incentivize network operation, when you consider operation to mean growth and user base expansion. It only got big enough to become comfortable, and they don't want to deal with all the people who want to do business. Just like everything else, people act in self interest (usually). If the miners wanted it, they'd abandon core or make them write the features that they wanted. That's what peak Bitcoin looks like, unless we get a massive influx of miners who are motivated differently.

Most of the time, yes,  smarts at least help you get success within a range of what opportunities you have access to. And the rest of the time . . . ____. The is no 100% risk free combination of smart behaviors that lead to money (even starting out already rich and smart, but that's probably 99.99%). That is to say, luck always plays a part for better or for worse, as well (lucky to have whatever happens to work out for you; to be healthy, born beautiful or at least not so ugly that people avoid you, athletic, mentally healthy, get the winning opportunities, meet the right people, have a family that doesn't hold you back, avoid accidents, theft, betrayal, etc etc). Just because you can ruin anything by being sufficiently stupid (and not again lucky) doesn't mean anything that's ruined was because of stupidity.\n\nOn the flip side, finding happiness without needing as much money is the ultimate life hack.\n\nLife has a lot of variables
http://www.historynet.com/men-against-fire-how-many-soldiers-actually-fired-their-weapons-at-the-enemy-during-the-vietnam-war.htm\n\nI have read (casually... I am unclear on the reliability of what I've read) that it has changed significantly over time. This is one such article. Careful study and motivated training between WWII and Vietnam, in particular, raised the percentages of those US soldiers who shot to kill. As it says, though, it's hard to say what happened during combat, longitudinally, though. Most importantly, it's unclear to what extent the success of that effort was overrated, too.
There are a lot of us, we just tend to get drowned out by the more vocal ones that everyone typically thinks of when thinking of conservatism.

Regarding his personal life, strictly speaking, I really doubt that there's anything worse out there than what Nicole Kidman and Katie Holmes could tell us if they wished. If those two are not out to get him (and they do not appear to be), then the rest of the world can probably hand-wave it.\n\nThe real story is scientology itself. He's been instrumental in keeping that train rolling, and it has a massive list of offenses to be disgusted by. They treat people like no one should be treated.

This coloring book is really not funny, and helps people not at all. Come on, at least mention "audit2allow" or the AVC log. If anything, it's hurting the selinux cause. You wouldn't be entirely unreasonable to assume "oh they think the coloring book is funny . . . I guess the selinux authors and users really are just a gang of smug idiots who cannot be relied on to help me. setenforce 0 it is." You wouldn't talk about file permissions and not tell them about "ls -l" or "chmod" yet somehow it's funny to pretend to be educational with a cat and a dog talking about how your system is going to be broken and implying that you will never know why?\n\nand before anyone gets mad at me, just hear this, first, that I did NOT disable selinux.
If the cops and Congress decide that they'd rather let him have what he wants than  obey court orders, that would be it. The Constitution is just paper.

Everybody loved Colin Powell until he went to the UN and lied for Bush. He could have been president if he'd wanted it. 
That's very funny, dad. Thank you for making a joke.
It's also bizarre to me that, in everyone's mind, whenever "the government" does something, that means that Trump somehow did it. This was the USDA's decision. I agree that they ultimately report to Trump, but he's not down there demanding they do things. \n\nIt seems like almost every news story that gets traction here has Trump shoe-horned into somehow. 
A prime example, I doubt he still has that view considering it's how he won the presidency.
Sorry for the delayed response, and sorry for not directly addressing your question, but here's what I think:\n\nI don't really care how the author feels about the Church, or whether or not he actually believes the GO was a rogue branch, acting without the greater organization's knowledge or consent. He may be biased and that may undercut his conclusions, but the facts that he states in support of those conclusions are verifiable and accurately recounted. That's all I'm relying on his report for - an account of how the Church reacted to the GO's actions. \n\nYou may wonder why I don't care; it's because whether or not the Church was *actually* ignorant can be argued about at length, with no one able to reach a definitive conclusion. \n\nIf I'm a prosecutor looking at this case, I'm more worried about what I can prove beyond a reasonable doubt - not what I suspect. And that is what is relevant to OP's question about why the organization as a whole didn't face greater repercussions. Because prosecutors would have too difficult a time proving anything about what the Church knew - especially in light of how the Church reacted.

But people liked Obama and they don't seem to like Trump, and people tend to take shots at people they don't like. In every case - Trump, Obama, or Lövin - it's just political posturing. 
I honestly don't know. Although it seems like the government *shouldn't* be able to sell. The idea being that the psuedo-equity stake is supposed to operate like a tax, and the government generally doesn't sell its right to collect taxes from a certain entity. \n\nBesides, it's not like the Government would actually be buying the stock in this situation, it's just a method for replacing a traditional tax with a "tax" that is tied to a % of profits.

I used to do antitrust law for a state agency. I thought you were pretty spot on. There's a reason we regulate utilities the way we do, and all of those reasons should apply to telecom. \n\nEven in Texas where we have supposedly "deregulated" the electricity market, providers still have to apply with a state agency before they can raise rates. \n\nThe idea of completely deregulating telecoms is beyond retarded. And I say that as someone who generally leans conservative.
*AND* then leave it to the people of France upon his death. Which is swell. 
Fuck this is painfully true.
1. Reducing protections for highly educated professionals (i.e. make it easier for foreign doctors to practice in the US)\n\n2. Facilitate medical travel\n\n3. Allow for internationalization of Medicare (allow medicare recipients outside the US to buy into the host country's system)\n\n4. Develop alternatives to patent financing for prescription drugs (i.e. have the US Gov pay for more research and make results publicly available, rather than relying on private businesses who patent drugs in order to recoup costs)\n\n5. Replace corporate income tax with psuedo-equity stake (give government non-voting shares in a company rather than pay taxes)\n\n6. Individual tax credits as a replacement for copyrights (wat)\n\n7. Work-sharing alternatives to unemployment insurance (offer employees the option to work fewer hours rather than get laid off; gov gives money to make up difference in salary)\n\n8. Vacant property tax

I kinda like number 5, just for the novelty of it. Number 7 has a lot of superficial appeal as well. Numbers 1, 3, and 8 are all a little odd.\n\nNumber 6 seems so unworkable I have to doubt the author's familiarity with copyright law. Especially when there are much, much simpler solutions available (e.g. reduce the term of a copyright). 
There's got to be an r/relationships thread about this. 
The hypocrisy of the left is staggering. That's what happens when you follow people rather than principles. \n\nNew Yorkers are suddenly proponents of states' rights. Californians are talking succession. Every liberal I know is now vehemently opposed to executive orders as undemocratic. TPP was bad, now its good. \n\nYou reap what you sow. 
> open carry advocates who walk around with AR-15s are hated by a lot of people in the firearm community\n\nIt really depends on context. Slung over the shoulder with no magazine at an open-carry protest? Fine with me. Holding it magazine in, low and ready for no apparent reason? You are fucking retarded.

I'll go down on the ship with you. Anyone who thinks you become the top politician in a major western nation without knowing how to play the game is deeply naive. Anyone who thinks a politician is above that game because he's young, good looking, and knows how to play an audience is shallow to boot.\n\nBut there's a flip side that I think you're forgetting - he's still a person. He still has feeling and no matter how big a con artist, the holocaust can still resonate deeply with people. \n\nI mean, yes - you are correct.

Non-voting shares are often referred to as "preferred shares." Company's can generally set up tiers of ownership however they want, but usually "preferred shares" are entitled to regular dividends. \n\nThe idea is that a passive investor doesn't really want to get involved in running a business, but they do want ROI, so they'll take preferred shares. Normally, preferred shares will be converted into voting shares if dividends are *not paid, allowing the preferred share holders to throw some weight around and get their dough. 
I don't know enough about what the cabinet members do or who has chosen to argue that one way or another. Mattis and Chao seem like solid choices, I suppose. I can even understand Tillerson. \n\nBut like I said, I'm not well-informed enough to have a strong opinion one way or the other. 
Of course. 
I'm not a woman, but women tell me that there are still systemic issues that adversely affect them. It's not about rights - I mean, I agree that women have the same rights as men. Does that mean that there are no longer issues that disproportionately harm men? Are men not still at an unfair disadvantage when it comes to divorce or reproductive rights? Do men not still suffer disproportionate sentencing in the criminal justice system? Same question, but let's make it about black people. They have the same rights as white people, but still suffer much harsher sentencing and are more likely to be arrested. They're also less likely to be hired.   \n\nThey can have the same rights and still have to deal with shit they shouldn't have to.\n\nIt's not a zero sum game. There's nothing wrong with advocating for better treatment of a group of people, and it doesn't imply that any other group of people needs to be treated worse as a result. I agree - women aren't oppressed in this country. But that's not what the protest was about. And I don't agree with the protest. I think it was a waste of time. But articles like this - from dontsteponsnek.com? - don't help anything. 
Tim!
Sure, sure. Don't get me wrong, it's a great picture. 
Because we don't require employers to keep employees they don't want. Sucks, but that's just the other side of the same coin that allows employers to get rid of incompetent employees. 
\n> Church leaders today maintain that this dark chapter in their religion's history was the work of renegade members who, yes, broke the law but believed they were justified because the government for two decades had harassed and persecuted Scientology.\n\n> Boston attorney Earle C. Cooley, Scientology's national trial counsel, said the present church management does not condone the criminal activities of the old Guardian Office. He said that one of Hubbard's most important dictums was to "maintain friendly relations with the environment and the public."\n\n> "The question that I always have in my mind," Cooley said, "is for how long a time is the church going to have to continue to pay the price for what the (Guardian Office) did. ... Unfortunately, the church continues to be confronted with it.\n\n> "And the ironic thing is that the people being confronted with it are the people who wiped it out. And to the church, that's a very frustrating thing."\n\nhttp://www.latimes.com/local/la-scientologysidec062490-story.html\n\nAdditionally, the Church of Scientology has disbanded the Guardian Office (the department within the organization responsible for Operation Snow White) and replaced it with the Office of Special Affairs. *See* Davis, Derek; Barry Hankins (2003). *New Religious Movements and Religious Liberty in America.* Baylor University Press.\n\nThis is why the organization itself faced minimal repercussions. It deflected blame onto individuals, vowed to change its culture, and disbanded the offending branch. Federal prosecutors would rather focus on the individual bad actors within the organization, and so they did. 
This is in the UK. 
I'm not familiar enough with the charges to comment. However, I think the comparisons he draws in the article are fair and his account is factually accurate. The fact that he may have some bias doesn't undercut his statement of the events or the Church's response. 
"It's so emo!"\n\nThat's when I knew it was time to stop worrying about taste. I'd call it shoegazer, or drone, or something other than emo, but it doesn't even matter.

Their view of Scientology is surprisingly positive, and they point out that the conflict between new religions and government isn't a new thing. Even Christianity was at one point considered a crack-pot cult.\n\nThey're credulous about the Church's claims that they were unaware of what the GO was doing with Operation Snow White, and that the revelations lead to "a complete reorganization of the church at the national, continental, and international level...." After an internal investigation by the Church, 11 high level officials connected to OSW were required to resign. Some were even expelled entirely from the Church. In 1983 the Church decided that the GO was "unsalvageable" and disbanded it. This even lead to the relocation of Church headquarters.\n\nAll in all, the Church's claimed ignorance is believed by the authors, and they make a good point that the revelations lead to a dramatic change in the entire organization and personnel. \n\nEdit: Also, please bear in mind that the entire book isn't by Davis and Hankins. It's a collection of articles written by other authors. Most of my information is from *A Contemporary Ordered Religious Community: The Sea Organization* by J. Gordon Melton.
This sounds more like some functions or tasks within those industries is being automated, but that doesn't mean the jobs themselves are. I can see that leading to a reduction of jobs, but no where near the amount that is (or will be) seen for factor jobs.

Twin Peaks is the bomb though.
The OP tacitly indicated that he was soliciting responses about US airports in the wake of the new executive order restricting immigration from countries with ties to (or issues with) terrorism.\n\nThis poster took the AMA request at face value and described his situation at the Saigon airport - which is actually in an unusual position due to the Lunar New Year ~~"Chinese" New Year (is it still considered Chinese? I don't know)~~ creating a great deal more travel than usual. \n\nWhich is a bit funny, because his response is still valid if unexpected.
"My name is ASAC Schrader, and you can go fuck yourself."

That's all I'm saying - if a group of people isn't happy with how their being treated, and they have a point of focus for expressing that unhappiness, then I have no problem with them getting together and expressing that discontent. \n\nOn top of that, the linked article is snarky and pandering. It doesn't offer any real critique of protest. All that shit about sharia law...I mean, what the hell? Can we not strive to be better than some third world shit hole?\n\nI don't like the article. It didn't accurately represent the point of the protest, and it was by and large low effort fluff designed to please a certain audience. Basically, the kind of thing I expect from CNN or Vox or HuffPo.

I don't necessarily disagree, but I think you're underestimating the cost of the wall. You can't just roll down there and start building. There are a ton of soft costs beyond materials and labor. Not even mentioning the massive sum that will be required to condemn all the privately held property the wall will have to cross. 
You've hit the nail on the head. \n\nI mean, what's so legal about driving 70 mph on the highway, but so dangerous and illegal about driving 71, or even 75?\n\nNothing. But we have to draw the line somewhere, and where that line is will be arbitrary to a certain extent. Plus, there is some benefit in having a bright-line rule - it's easy to follow. 
He's not wrong though. He's just explaining the state of things today, without the history that lead to this situation. 
The new cycle for me with anything Trump related goes \n\n1. Negative thing about Trump gets posted \n\n2. Things seems too moronic, ironic, or hilarious to be true\n\n3. Look in comments, turns out thing is not true or is only partially true\n\n4. Rinse and repeat\n\nIt's getting to the point where I'm skeptical of what are completely reasonable criticisms. There's just so much bullshit generating FUD around this election that I'm overloaded trying to wade through it all. \n\nOf course I had to do the same thing in 2008, but at least back then it was just older relatives posting bullshit on facebook. If I didn't watch Fox News or read Drudge Report, I could avoid dealing with it. But now it's everywhere.

Fair enough, but I'm not arguing with you. It is a matter of fact that lawyers and judges interpret the written law relying (in part) on the drafter's intent. You may not like it or think it's bad practice, but that doesn't make it not so. 
I worked in the Capitol for years. Several conservative politicians, including Rick Perry, were opposed building a border wall. The concern was that it would be expensive, ineffective, and damage existing infrastructure. For one, you have the aforementioned eminent domain issues. Two, there are several porous areas along the border that are that way by design, and do not contribute to illegal immigration. Putting a wall there will screw them up. Lastly, building a wall without effectively manning it will do almost nothing, except maybe donate building materials to several of the colonias nearby. \n\nI'd rather spend all that money increasing boots on the ground and giving Border Patrol agents better equipment. 
What the actual fuck is going on with r/pics?

HBO cancelled it before its time (needed about two more seasons), but the show creators did a good job of giving it a satisfying close to all the arcs. \n\nI would recommend it highly, especially the first 3 seasons. 
> But that's not the problem I or other people on this sub have with the women's march. They didn't come out and sensibly protest an issue or law or something. \n\nLook, I agree with this. I'm not supporting the protest, but I think this article was dogshit and I think the above post missed the point. 
Yeah...maybe. But I have my doubts. Judges - especially appellate judges - aren't law machines where you input rules and facts and they spit out law. They're people with experience and intuition. They *typically* know bullshitters who are trying to game the system.\n\nPlus they have the option of not hearing the appeal. You can then appeal their decision not to hear the appeal, which the state Supreme Court can also choose not the hear. \n\nThis happened a lot in law school; students would forget that judges are people who know the difference between the spirit and the letter of the law. You can show a person the rules and tell them the facts, but there is nuance in the application of one to the other - students would tend to get myopic about that aspect and just assume that the law works like a math equation. It doesn't. You can get away with some things, but this type of shit will not generally fly. \n\nEdit: I also think you might forfeit your option to sue for cruel and unusual punishment if you don't appeal the original sentence. You can't accept the sentence, carry it out, then sue.

> protesting for rights they already have\n\nI completely disagree with this kind of thinking. Firstly, because they weren't protesting about rights they already have. They were protesting persistent issues that relate to gender in our country. Agree with it or not, that was the point of the protest. Second, and while it may seem undeserved to some, Trump has become a lightning rod for those issues due to his disgusting comments about grabbing women by the pussy and his recent actions related to abortions. \n\nPersonally, I think the protests were ill-conceived, poorly executed, and accomplished nothing. But there are obviously a huge number of Americans who disagree with me and that's fine. I'm a gun owner and I certainly don't intend to stop protesting in favor of "rights I already have."\n\nProtesting is a first amendment thing. There weren't any riots or arrests. I disagree with it, but that's America and I wouldn't have it any other way.
"Legislative intent" is 100% a thing that courts determine all the time. Nothing strange about it, and it's no different for the bill of rights.

Do most states not do that? I live in Texas - we don't have income tax, so (almost) everything gets paid for with property taxes. It actually works pretty well and gives you some control over your state taxes (e.g. by living somewhere with lower home values). 
What is giving you that impression? I haven't seen anything that seriously indicates those high-end professional services are being automated. 
This question is a bit hard to answer, but I can give you some insight from a legal perspective. \n\nCriminal prosecutions of organizations (for example, a business firm, or in this instance a "church") are guided by the U.S. Attorneys' manual, which is promulgated by the Office of the U.S. Attorney. The relevant materials can be found [here.](https://www.justice.gov/usam/usam-9-28000-principles-federal-prosecution-business-organizations)\n\nHere are some guidelines from the manual:\n\n> Prosecutors should focus on wrongdoing by individuals from the very beginning of any investigation of corporate misconduct.  By focusing on building cases against individual wrongdoers, we accomplish multiple goals. First, we increase our ability to identify the full extent of corporate misconduct.  **Because a corporation only acts through individuals, investigating the conduct of individuals is the most efficient and effective way to determine the facts and the extent of any corporate misconduct.**  Second, a focus on individuals increases the likelihood that those with knowledge of the corporate misconduct will be identified and provide information about the individuals involved, at any level of an organization.  Third, we maximize the likelihood that the final resolution will include charges against culpable individuals and not just the corporation.\n\nMore specific information about prosecuting individuals can be found [here.](https://www.justice.gov/usam/usam-9-28000-principles-federal-prosecution-business-organizations#9-28.210)\n\nAnother relevant bit:\n\n> Prosecutors should be aware of the public benefits that can flow from indicting a corporation in appropriate cases. For instance, **corporations are likely to take immediate remedial steps when one is indicted for criminal misconduct** that is pervasive throughout a particular industry, and thus an indictment can provide a unique opportunity for deterrence on a broad scale. In addition, a corporate indictment may result in specific deterrence by changing the culture of the indicted corporation and the behavior of its employees.\n\nThere are practical difficulties to go along with these states goals. Specifically, many criminal charges require a level of intent, or *mens rea*, which really doesn't apply to an organization, because it's a legal fiction that must operate through individuals. While this doesn't necessarily prevent the criminal prosecution of an organization, it does make it more difficult if other members of the organization claim that the individual bad-actors were not acting on behalf of the organization, but were rather rogue agents. And this is, of course, what the Church of Scientology claimed:\n
Time tested method, and has an error rate of almost 0 when properly implemented. 
Hey goddamnit. Michelle Williams is a legitimate gospel singer. 
What's strange is no one in the linked thread is talking about gun-related politics or politics at all. It's just gun guys goofing off. The OP is known for being snarky and opinionated, and he's just using that reputation as a way to solicit donations. \n\nIt's like the internet version of volunteering at the dunking booth. Which is awesome, and I think completely bestof material. I mean, his response posts are really well-informed and thoughtful. The idea is funny, the execution is funny, and it was all very well-meaning. What's not to like?\n\nOh yeah, guns. So of course this thread has gotten really nasty and political.

Trump and Spicer have both said that this is what they're referring to.\n\nTrump said: "We’re working on a tax reform bill that will reduce our trade deficits, increase American exports and will generate revenue from Mexico that will pay for the wall if we decide to go that route."\n\nSean Spicer then followed this up with comments suggesting that the Trump administration is considering a 20% tax on imports, starting with Mexico, that would help finance the building of a border wall between the US and Mexico. "When you look at the plan that’s taking shape now, using comprehensive tax reform as a means to tax imports from countries that we have a trade deficit from, like Mexico. If you tax that $50 billion at 20 percent of imports — which is by the way a practice that 160 other countries do — right now our country’s policy is to tax exports and let imports flow freely in, which is ridiculous."\n\nSo this is what they're talking about. And it is not uncommon, it's just not used by the US.
I guess my point is that this is all just showcasing to appeal to voters. \n\nSome people will like Obama more because his picks were more diverse, some people won't because they'll see PC culture run amok. Some people will like Trump more because he ostensibly eschews diversity for meritocracy, some people won't because they'll see a bigot who only wants the opinions of rich white men.
This is what I can't understand. How is it not deeply troubling that the intelligence community - an unelected group that are notorious for avoiding accountability and operating in secret - is working to undermine a democratically elected administration?\n\nAll of these leaks in the the last few weeks - they're all coming from the intelligence community. How is it that a newspaper is able to get its hands on the transcript of the head of national security's phone calls? \n\nAnd people are giving this pass because FUCK TRUMP. Really? Now you think the CIA/FBI/NSA has the nation's best interests at heart?

Got it for free with my new GPU so yeah I have it. A buddy of mine tried it out in the beta with me and liked it enough to pre-order it. My brother might also get it a couple months after launch.
The music was really the only part of the show I liked
That would work too, but as no one has commented on it and the writers haven't said anything about it (I think) that kinda makes me doubt he can do it. I mean we know it isn't his semblance.
If I were a betting man I'd say they asked him to wait another 25 years.
Out of curiosity what is your GPU? I've been getting the same thing with a brand new 1070 and my buddy has a 980ti and is getting the same. The only thing that seems to fix it is setting all settings to low. The freeze seems to coincide with the GPU dropping down to 0 utilization. I have yet to see it in any other game so it's something particular with Wildlands.
Oh really? I thought it was just a damage change, I didn't realize it affected the speed of the round (even though that is exactly what it does in real life)
Ignore him, in his eyes you can ignore laws if your intentions are good.

My buddy and I can't wait to try it on the hardest setting with no HUD. I really want to find all the weapons and attachments, it's one of my favorite parts of the game.

You nailed it. The Nevermore & Deathstalker fight in V1 grabbed me for it's choreography. The finale fight in V4 grabbed me as well, but not because the fight was a sight to behold, but because I am emotionally invested in the characters and what happens to them.\n\nFrom a choreography standpoint the fight in the V4 finale was just boring in comparison to the one from V1.
It's so completely unsurprising that they would leave their garbage for others to pick up. Another blatant display of their "I matter most" mindset.
That's the combo I used, it was a bit stressful though when helis showed up as I didn't have the 40mm to deal with them.
Turning off HUD elements really ups the difficulty.

I've been really enjoying it, despite the freezing I am getting every 10 mins or so. However I knew what to expect so my expectations weren't that high. This is after all Ubisoft, creators of Assassin's "climb another tower" Creed, and Far "attack another outpost" Cry. They stick to what is safe and will make the most amount of money for the least amount of risk/effort. You can't look to them to innovate or even deviate from the "formula". \n\nFor that we have studios like CD Projeckt Red, who actually care about what they create beyond just making a profit. So this doesn't surprise me. But I got what I expected and wanted, which is an open world where I can have semi-accurate combat and play with friends. Unfortunately none of my friends are getting the game because they forgot that it was made by Ubisoft and therefore follows the same mold as every game they make.
I was playing GTA:V and all of a sudden the roads weren't rendering or anything. Alt-tabbed to see what the cause is and see the background download. Can't wait for tomorrow.

Shouldn't be too hard, some animation changes (like the legs of the "captive" dragging instead of moving) and some coding to allow for it. 
Good on them then. It's idiotic to act like your party was cheated because the popular vote doesn't matter. Both candidates know how the game is played and Hillary played to the states that matter because of the EC, as has every president. Those crying about the popular vote are really just hating on the rules of the game because they lost.
Also running a 1070 and I'm getting massive fps drops at times. I'm talking going from 80+ down to 4 and the game freezing for 4 or 5 seconds as a result. No other game seems to be doing it and I have no idea what the issue is
But that's now how elections are won, and she knew that.
In self defense? Fuck yeah.
THIS IS HAPPENING!
Such a shitty thing to do
Depends on the bullet, a .45 for instance is slow and heavy and has a decent amount of drop. One way to reduce bullet drop is taking off the suppressor, I seem to remember it decreasing drop as well as increasing speed (and according to a couple posts on this sub also allows for object penetration).\n\nAs cool as it would be for them to change bullet drop on a per weapon (or caliber) basis, a general drop at around 200m seems alright with me.
It wouldn't be able to handle it, sorry bud.
It's supposed to ensure that all states have equal voting power and is a compromise so that the president is elected both by the people and by congress. It was set up this way so that a charismatic tyrant couldn't come into power by manipulation of public opinion. \n\nThat's about as much as I understand it, I should do some more in depth research on it myself.
I actually didn't start reading the books until last week. So many things I didn't know.

Unless there's something I'm missing the federal government could absolutely go after recreational marijuana use even in states that have legalized it. Federal law supersedes state law and marijuana is still classified as a schedule 1 drug (which is complete bullshit considering one of the requirements for being a schedule 1 drug is no medical use).
Is there a reason why the video is suddenly unavailable in the US?
Ah ok, that's different then. They just said they were "comparable" which I had serious doubts about. But if it's just reskins of existing weapons then that's just fine.
Their candidate lost so they have to show how upset they are with the results.
I actually chose Wildlands for my promo, after trying out the open beta of For Honor I realized it just wasn't my cup of tea.
Not all of them do but they are trying to change that. My ISP (Comcast) rolled them out in my area not long ago, and there are no other really good ISPs to go to, so I just have to bend over and pay the extra money each month. Hooray net neutrality and corporatism!
When you cease being able to think for yourself and can only parrot what your betters tell you. Also known as the majority of the left.
Wow.......CA cannot break off into the pacific soon enough
It reminds me of BF3 and 4, the drop and the travel time add to the suspense and make you feel like a badass for making that shot.
It's about half of the speed the actual round would have. He's using an M40A5 for the final shot and it uses the .308 cartridge. Depending on the grain of the bullet and the powder load you could get different results but even a large 185gr bullet would have a velocity of around 770 m/s. \n\nSo whatever is being used in the game has a slower velocity than that. I wish it were more realistic but I assume they have some reason for not using real data.
You're being downvoted but you're not wrong. Marijuana is still illegal under federal law, which does supersede state law.
Just dropping in here to state that I have a Nexus 6P and I did the build prop mod to allow me to get Google Assistant. Since doing that I am getting the same issue as OP, before the build prop mod I never had any issues with "ok google" unlocking the phone.
How do you know it's 100 hours?
The copper jacket helps prevent deformation, especially since this is a full metal jacket and not a hollow point.
Not sure, I killed one of them one time after he surrendered and was told "no, bad spec ops person with no accountability! Do it again and the game might end" 
Hooray! I'm average!
I just really need that in my mouth right now
I was under the impression that the drone optics were under a different key? In my menu it showed it was 'v' instead of 'n'. That being said pressing 'v' never turned it on, always had to do it before launching the drone.
Unless/until they add more I would think so.
I recently went through the process of trying to get it on my 6P and I'm not sure you can get it without root. At the minimum you will have to unlock your bootloader which means you will have to reset the device. And when I tried to install TWRP I HAD to install SuperSU at the same time, otherwise TWRP wouldn't stick (this is an issue with 7.0). It was a real pain in the ass but in the end I got Assistant, have an unlocked Bootloader, and am rooted.
I'd really rather not, that and r/politics are two cesspools I'd like to stay away from
Random HVTs for elimination or interrogation could be cool. Hijacking convoys or choppers could be fun. Ideally it would be for something tangible in game, though I doubt they have a system set up for that. But adding in new unique (or just plain new) weapons based on completing these challenges would be fun. 
The alarm towers kind of make some sense, unless someone is right next to it they aren't likely to hear the bullet impacting the box. But if they're close enough they should investigate. The power going out and all the NPCs just going about their day is really immersion breaking, and makes no sense. \n\nI'm really hoping for an AI rework sometime in the future, though I'm not holding my breath for it.
I mean I can appreciate it, it's just odd that they pay so much homage to the lore and then change her hair on a whim lol
Yeah this happening to me as well, it even happens in the middle of a round. Toggling the setting does fix it for a short amount of time, but it always comes back.
Same. I just got into chapter 3 of Blood of Elves and I'm very confused about many things, for instance Triss's hair
This seems about right from what else I have observed. Quite a few things are local only, for instance the chickens are local to you. My buddy was shooting chickens while I was getting a drink, I come back and they are all right there in front of me and still alive, but on his screen they exploded into puffs of feathers.\n\nRadios also seem to be local only, same for jokes told by the soldiers.\n\nWay too much of it is localized when playing with other people, not liking that at all to be honest.
Good
Can confirm. Any time a Winston or a Genji jumps into the back line I run screaming to the nearest DPS/Tank
You are correct, however I would still recommend looking into getting some self protection. As cliche as it is the saying "when seconds count the police are minutes away" is very true.
Was he actually able to refund the full 500k? From the looks of it the payment system actually declined a few of his attempts as he only had one login ID and the system stated that you can only refund transactions that took place with your ID.
I would be OK with this
Anything beyond around 200m and you start to get drop. There were a couple shots I took at some alarms from over 500m and I had to aim about 4 or 5 ticks down from the center. Side note, you don't actually have to hit the power box on them to shut them down, just a hit in the general area will do.
Not a fan of this. Microtransactions for cosmetics is fine, for weapons it's not. Either make the weapons part of the base game or tie them into DLC. Not a fan of weaponry you have to pay for.
The presidency isn't decided by popular vote. Those that supported Hillary keep going "but the popular vote!" but had roles been reversed (Trump won popular but lost EC) the Hillary supporters would be saying the same thing: "popular vote doesn't decide presidency". \n\nIt's only brought up so much because their candidate lost and they want to blame the EC because they feel cheated and they don't like who won
Well said. People are acting like there are going to be roving death squads in the streets shooting anyone who Trump doesn't like. Their so caught up in their own fear mongering and victim status that they can't think logically.
I have one friend that pre-ordered the game (I got it for free with a new GPU) and I'm going to try and convince him we play through it with no HUD or minimal HUD to increase difficulty and lengthen gameplay. \n\nI'm not sure what they'll do as far as endgame, it's not an RPG like  The Division so I doubt we'd get extra content like that game has. More likely it'll be extra missions/zones via DLC and that'll be it. Either way I hope they prioritize polish and patching before even thinking about DLC, but knowing Ubi they have likely already started development on the DLC.
Nope, if you're kissing a wall instead of placing the C4 like a sane person you lob it like a 5 year old at softball tryouts
Exactly this, just mark them up and call your targets. Once you all have the shot you go on 3. Far more fun when your squadmates can actually miss their target too, adds to the suspense.
Usually if you patent any tech while working for a company they own the patents
ISPs will try and kill this via data caps and their competing service(s) which won't count towards the cap. While this is good news it won't really force any competition so long as ISPs can grab you by the balls via data caps.

Oh, and here I thought he was elected through a democratic process and legitimately won the presidency. Damned conservatives rigging the election!
I guess if it's the kind of thing the deceased would have liked or laughed it then it's fine. Just seems so disrespectful to me.
I hope that on higher difficulties they add in ammo loss if you reload after firing two rounds. So you lose whatever ammo was left in the mag similar to BF4's hardcore mode.
Once you have all your intel they are useless. Unless you're starting some kind of kinky sex dungeon...
Same here. At 1080p on ultra I get around 45-60, depending on what I am looking at, with ultra settings with a GTX 1070. However I get freezes often enough to make it not worth playing at those settings. The game basically locks up for 4-5 seconds, and watching GPU usage shows that every time it happens GPU usage drops to zero. Only happens in Wildlands though.
Unsubbing from that and /r/politics has made my feed so much better
My big issue with that game was their idea of making things tougher meant everything became a bullet sponge. Very boring to me.
Just you, likely same for your difficulty. Quite a bit of the game is local to you. For instance what you see/hear in the game is not the same as what your friends see/hear.
I actually love the chatty dialogue between the squad members. Yeah it's cheesy but it's funny and can relieve some of the tension or the boring aspects when driving/flying to your next objective. 
The analogy of politics and sports is really spot on, doesn't matter what your "team" says or does so long as they beat the other guys.
What settings? Also can you grab a screenshot of the final results of a benchmark?
In that situation yes, but if you think a knife is better for you than a gun do what you think is best. 
Possibly, but a buddy of mine is getting the same issue with his 980ti. The only sure-fire fix we have found is setting everything in the game to low or off. I was tempted to start fucking around with the settings to see what exactly is causing it but decided not to bother until we have some drivers for the game.
These are fucking epic! Blizz seriously, run with this
Good thing the Reddit pussy brigade is just a small minority after all, which the election proved. All of your virtue signaling doesn't mean dick, America is now on the path of getting shit done. Get fucked. 
What exactly is he hostile about? Is he really so hostile or is the media's coverage of him hostile?
You are unhinged. \n\n>Plenty of Trump supporters are ok with killing illegal immigrants on sight.\n\nSource? What's your definition of plenty?

They're not socialism at all. Are you literally retarded or did you just graduate high school? The government investing in infrastructure is in no way shape or form socialism or even related to socialism.

I fail to see how it's hate speech. Men and women are physiologically different. It's *impossible* to you that those differences, molded by evolution over millions of years and permanently encoded in our genes, could express themselves in varying cognitive abilities in modern society? ***Impossible***? \n\nThe fact that you worked and were taught by female scientists means literally nothing. Negligible sample size, plus there would be a ton of overlap in the Bell curve - millions of women who were great at scientific endeavors. \n\nBut, just to mirror your point - I've worked with females in the STEM industry, been taught by them and had them as classmates. I have never encountered these women being treated poorly or sexist, and in fact they received preferential treatment more than anything. 
yep, that's pretty much the cult of "fact checking"
Man, the best curry I ever had was at a hawker market in Singapore. It was just a couple bucks. God damn I wish I could go back right now and get some of that shit. The dude was serving the naan straight out of one of those cylindrical brick ovens. Hnnnng
Not really, that's just what pit apologists try to say. \n\nThat "study" (survey) is trash. None of the dogs are >50% one breed so obviously they're going to be very hard to identify. Most of them are 25% and lower. \n\nAnd besides that point - there are many many thousands of dog breeds. Pit bulls make up 3 or so and are easily identifiable when they make up a decent chunk of the genes. 
How about people take responsibility for themselves and stop eating like absolute shit? People *can* do it. It's not out of their control. We can do a much better job of teaching them and holding them to higher expectations. It works, and it's cheaper and much easier than more heavy-handed regulations.
Nice ad hominem. I'd be interested to see an actual response. But it looks like in typical Leftist zealot fashion - you're going to proclaim your outrage and flee at the sign of any serious discourse. Sad!

Just to clarify Foulke's find was the most complete skeleton found *up to that point*, if anyone is confused (like I was).\n

I am just pointing out an indisputable fact that he was not good in college whereas almost every NFL starting qb was.

What is that defense by the Pelicans guard on Westbrook? Get off the court scrub, I'd bench that dude so fast. That's pickup ball defense. In a close game too. Embarrassing. 
I have a feeling that all the "shitty" commercials we complain about here are probably driven by troves of data and research and work well in the big picture. There's just too much money at stake for these companies. They have access to so much information. And even if we hate them, we still talk about them which keeps the companies in that "name recognition" territory which is probably what they're after. \n\nI dunno, I don't know shit about ads and marketing.

I think [this](https://www.census.gov/hhes/families/files/graphics/HH-6.pdf) may be the household data you alluded to. The data could surely throw a wrench into household income over time statistics. \n\nHowever the OP linked individual income by sex, was wondering how you account for that even if non-wage income is considered? Someone else seemed to think that non-wage income was included in the income-by-sex data. \n\nApologies if I missed something - I'm on mobile so it's hard to peruse all the data. 
Uh, words don't matter man. Actions matter. Your "cursory" glance at history illustrates that fact quite well.

Is my understanding of this chart correct in that the 0% means you have to have literally no income (ie homeless from your post) to get Medicaid?\n\nWhy don't the ACA subsidies start automatically after the state-level Medicaid cutoff? That would be an easy fix no? Or am I oversimplifying?\n\nAnother thing I want to point out is that, according to the data on [this website](https://www.valuepenguin.com/understanding-aca-subsidies), the "subsidized" premiums are still quite expensive if you're at the mid-upper end of the range. \n\nLook at their example:\n\n>To illustrate, for a single individual with an income of $28,725, the applicable FPL would be $11,490 and their income would be 250% of that amount. Under the law this would cap their yearly premium for that Silver Plan at 8.04 of their annual income $2,313 or about $193 monthly. \n\nAlmost $200/month for someone making less than $30K? That's crazy to me. I would imagine that plays a significant role in the "coverage gap." Not that it means anything statistically significant but I know healthy people who fall into this category that choose not to buy Obamacare and pay the penalty because it's cheaper.\n\nI'd be interested in some data on *who* exactly doesn't have health insurance and their income.

Probably that I had received some *information* indicating my suspicion. \n\nIn the case of this "article", there is no such information, or really anything indicating there were hacks or interference or whatever.

The EA doesn't have to solve the entire problem of terrorism. \n\nIf *some* acts of terror are committed by radicalized immigrants, then stopping immigration seems like a no brainer at least in the short term.

Someone elsewhere in the thread linked [this page](http://kff.org/uninsured/fact-sheet/key-facts-about-the-uninsured-population/), it has a partial answer to your last question. Look at the graph Figure 2. \n\nIt seems like the ACA has worked quite well for people in extreme poverty (<200% FPL) but there are those at the upper end of the subsidy range where it's still too expensive.

Anecdotally, I played football for 11 years from the age of 7 to 18 and around 19 years old I developed a peripheral neuropathy that causes chronic pain in my feet and ankles. I was never diagnosed with a concussion but my football career ended almost 15 years ago before concussion awareness had been raised significantly. I often wonder if there could be a connection between the repeated blows to the head and my current condition. Thanks for doing this AMA!

I agree about the maps and the titan gameplay. I don't like any of the maps in TF2 as much as the maps in TF1. I definitely prefer the Titan Gameplay of TF1. It felt much more balanced. Now everyone plays Tone or Legion and most other titans get destroyed pretty quickly. Another point, the titan shields in TF1 made it so that AI controlled titans seemed much more viable. Now if you spend much time outside of your titan you can pretty much guarantee that someone else will have destroyed it by the time you are ready to go back to it.

I would argue that there is a cost to the airline. They have to build and maintain the functionality that lets you select a seat. The fee offsets some of that cost. For example, Southwest has no need for this functionality and therefore incurs no cost and doesn't charge a fee.

My communications professor had a funny take on who reads what newspapers. He said:   \nThe Wall Street Journal is read by the people who run the country.    \nThe Washington Post is read by the people who think they run the country.   \nThe New York Times is ready by the people who think they ought to run the country.     \nThe Miami Herald is read by people who run other countries.       \nHis one for USA Today was: USA Today is read by the people who find the television news too difficult to understand.

And I argue that it is an unreasonable punishment because, unlike jail time, it will never end.  It's a perpetual punishment, tacked on to even the lowliest of felonies.  I wouldn't be opposed to disenfranchisement during jail time, and possibly even probation.  But if we're going to espouse ideas about rehabilitation and reintegration, why would we continue to punish someone who has carried out their sentence and presumably paid their debt to society.

As the media is has been taking great pains to point out, such strongmen start out as populists, and once the people are on their side they flip the script and take over completely.\n\nYa know, what Trump is supposedly doing.\n\nLogically, one should imagine that in the stateless Communist utopia where everything is done via direct democracy, such systems would be indemically vulnerabile to being taken over by populist strongmen.  I'm pretty sure the Ancient Greeks warned us about such things after the periodic slide of some their city states into the controls of Tyrants, whom we now call dictators.  But what do I know?  Marx was surely a student of history and couldn't possibly espouse a system so vulnerable to such development, right?  There's just no way that a group of people could allow themselves to be blind to the weaknesses of their preferred ideology, especially when the claims of said ideology *feel so good*.  Inconceivable.\n\nEdit: thanks for the gold, kind strangler.\n\n... and yes I've been waiting to use that *forever*.

Yeah but the mechanical skill to actually go that fast takes some time to develop.  I run 2-4 minute lakes and that is slow compared to some players/builds.
I believe PoE.xyz is now PoE.trade which is the PoE trading platform, not really a crafting tool.\n\nPah of Building has some facilities for that, they added a new gear crafting feature recently.  PoB is much more useful for playing with your build and digging into the numbers.

That's largely because they already have everything they need to get their new build off the ground.  A few tabs of leveling uniques mean they can focus entirely on powering through to maps instead of trying to figure out why they suddenly die all the time once hitting act 4.
Yes, well liberals need to excise the leftist cancer just like conservatives need to cut out the white supremacists and neo-nazis.\n\nAll you "social Democrats" need to understand that social Democracy isn't socialism, that socialists don't like you and will stab you in the back if it gets them closer to their utopia.\n\nFascism was a response to Socialism/Communism, not Liberalism.

Yeah, haven't looked at those builds at all.  Mostly play solo, so it never seemed like a viable option.  That being said, doing groups with an aurabot is amazing.
Same here, except it  seems to be possible to make the remove-only tabs public again and still get listed in PoE.trade.  I had a few sale tabs that I used in breach that were no longer public.  Making them public again maintained the same prices as before, and I sold at least a couple of things out of them over the course of the night.

I wonder what kind of "legacy code" pretzel logic they have going on that precludes MTX and Guild stash from working like the regular stash.  It's like they implemented three different versions of the stash functionality, it's weird.
Of if you expected "put American workers first" to mean "enacting a Marxist reform platform".\n\nIt might come as a surprise, but Marxist thought isn't the only alternative to the current status quo.
The pathologically obfuscated UI doesn't help matters at all.  Three cursor keys (two with page up/down combos), no idea which set of cursors keys will be used for what elements until you try them, pointless mnemonic menu items that breaks down quickly into being completely arbitrary (think having a,b,c for menus instead of n for nobels, d for designate, i for zones, etc).\n\nThe problem with military is that so many minutia are simulated you're essentially counting on your dwarves correctly interpreting your configuration.  And dwarves are extremely stupid, so they won't unless you know enough about the various bugs and gotchas to avoid "doing the wrong thing" on your military screen and possibly screwing your military up permanently.\n\nThe primary difficulty in DF is how buggy everything ends up being because of the insanely overcomplicated way everything is implemented.  Frankly it's a miracle the game works at all.  And you must always remember that DF is a simulation first, game second.  So decisions made to benefit the simulation will tend to detract from the gamey aspects.  For instance, in v40 Armies are actual groups of entities roaming around the world, but if there are no armies near your fort you may never see a single one. Sure, it's realistic, but makes the game really boring.\n
That's what 24 hour clock is for.  No AM/PM dongle necessary!
But the news *are* political hacks.  I'm not going to pretend anyone is capable of complete neutrality, but the media isn't even trying anymore.  In my view, they are the "opposition party" because they are the PR wing of the Democratic Party, if only in spirit and not in name.\n\nIt's always been that way, the news organizations have always had their own political views and agendas.  It's more recently that we've had them adopting a near consensus of left wing politics.  Fox news is the token right wing news organizations in a sea of homogeneous left wing news outlets.  \n\nThe "liberal news media" (so called for decades now, hardly controversial) needs Fox in the same way a stereotypical white dude needs a black friend, so they can claim "see, we're not a monoculture, look at Fox here, those right wing rascals, haha, this political consensus is totally organic, trust us" much in the same way as Joe Whiteguy can claim "I'm not racist, I have black friends!"  You would believe Joe, why are you believing CNN?
Which is why no one cares about what they have to say.  It's also why Bernie's "political revolution" is little more than the left wing tea party.  Nutters gonna do what nutters gonna do.
I would have imagines they'd do that with the forthcoming EU army, but this is an interesting possibility.  Now if only Arabs weren't renowned as the world's worst soldiers...

Cool story.  In any case, I'm not arguing Millennials are necessarily unique, but rather we're seeing a far more hyperbolic response by them to these issues, probably because the internet makes everything seecm hyperbolic.  In addition, it's not always straightforward to determine how far a particular message on the internet has spread to others.  That is, to what extent should internet texts be understood to be informing the discourse given that it isn't a simple matter (for regular users, i.e., not admins) to determine the reach and influence of any given text.\n\nSo when we watch a video of, say, a feminist going on about how men are all evil and should be matched off to gulags and kept for breeding purposes, or an Alt-righter claiming the international Jewry is promoting anti-White ideologies and trying to exterminate the white race, how are we supposed to determine the "nut-factor" of these voices?  Clearly, not all feminists believe men should be kept as breeding stock, but how is the general public supposed to know that, aside from "common sense"?\n\nConsidering every fifth or sixth word in any given Reddit thread is "sexist", "bigot" or "cuck" I'm curious to know how one *doesn't* come to the conclusion that Millennials, in particular, are obsessed with race and racism.
The contention is that Stalin's brand of Communism is an inevitable result of such Communism per se.  Once you've built your stateless utopia, some strong man will snap it up for their own benefit.  Shocking.
Yes, the arithmetic is simple.  Applying the effects of the damage to every enemy on the screen at once due to your immense AoE is not so trivial, even less so for stuff that hits that area multiple times.
What I meant to say is that if you intend on permanently barring someone from participation in our democratic system, then you may as well kill them instead, because obviously they aren't fit to be part of society.  A bit hyperbolic, but the permanent disenfranchisement for a felony, especially when it continues after release, is essentially civic death, and one more way for society to shit on people who already face a great deal of hardship, and one that they can never redeem themselves for.\n\nA great number of things are felony offenses, but how many of those can you say with confidence warrant the lifelong punishment of being reduced to a second class citizen?\n\nIn any case, the practice is already waning, and will probably disappear in all but the most implacably stubborn Red states.

A Radeon 7850 is enough for PoE, if you've got a decent CPU.  I personally went from an ancient AMd phenom2 to an i5, keeping the same GPU.  Frame rate is always above 60, typically in the mid 100s.  You absolutely do not need a beefcake GPU to play this game.  CPU über alles.
Why do you suppose they cling so tightly to the sociological definition of racism?  It's the tenous thread which keeps them from being lumped in with the rest of the racists they bang on about.

We must eliminate these dude's in fancy suites in order for realize the worker's paradise!

I've seen it on a normal Act map, we were getting chased by an exploding red circle like the one from Malachai pt 2.  It was some random ass area too, can't recall which one now.  Is there a prophecy that adds such a thing?
The "hard left" subs are gold.  Try /r/latestagecapitalism, they're super cereal over there.
After a while you'll get so efficient at levelling that you'll barely even notice Act 1 fly by.  Hell, I often forget to go back and claim quest rewards until I do /passives after getting to end game to see what I missed.  It is kind of nice getting three or four skill books at once, especially later on when levels have started to slow down a bit.
I tried the game back in 2013 when it was released but couldn't get the hang of it and eventually deleted he game because of obnoxious steam updates.  It took some videos from Quill18 during Essence to finally make things click, been hooked since the last week's of Essence.\n\nWatching someone level and build the tree helped immensely, along with a healthy dose of explaining some of the gotchas and little things to avoid noob traps and whatnot.\n\nAs for build guides, many only take you so far.  A lot of them are basically a tree and example gear, which is of questionable utility even for seasoned players.  This damnable game even needs a guide for choosing a guide, lol.
You will probably still hit the wall even with a build guide, unless you're the sort of person who adapts very quickly to the immense puzzle game that is gearing a character.  Unless the entire build is geared with uniques finding good rares, even with PoE.trsde, is non-trivial.  \n\nWhat's more, many build guides don't really give you much to work with in regards to what mods you should be looking for, how to gear while you level (I.E, incrementally improving your gear).  A lot for guides are basically just a tree (sometimes a set of them with progression), end game gear, flasks and jewels, and occasionally an explanation of how the build works.\n\nA build guide can go a long way towards helping new players get orientated but the quality of the build guides out there is so wildly variable that they can't possibly be considered tutorials, per se, except for the odd few which bill themselves as such.  There's no real curation of build guides other than their relative placement in a Google search.  Poebuilds helps, but even then the only metrics you have are the metadata for the forum post they're attached to.  "Oh, this one has 69k views, guess it's legit."\n\nAnother thing I've found is while they may have a video showing some gameplay of the build, there isn't any good indication of how difficult the build is going to be to play.  Some, like vaal spark, require a good deal of mechanical skill to be able to maintain the speed necessary to keep vspark charged and achieve the same wicked clear speed you'll see someone Tso getting.   Others, like Mathil, make nice builds for very highly skilled players, and while he may admit that you can skip some damage nodes in favor of more defense, it isn't usually abundantly clear that unless you've got Mathil tier knowledge of the game that you're probably going to have a bad time.\n\nI've only been playing since just before he end of Essence, so a lot of this is pretty fresh in my mind.  I've come a long way by following build guides and trying to understand why the guide does what it does, what the various nodes do and why the guide creator chose the paths they did.  What is never explained is the practice necessary to achieve the "gotta clear fast" meta, regardless of how OP your build is.  The streamers who zip through a map in two minutes didn't always do so, and as a new comer, expecting to be able to do so yourself in short order is unrealistic.
I'd call it left-lite.  They bring some of Marx's anti-capitalist ideas into capitalism, but aren't seeking to destroy it.  Socialsts tend to dislike liberals because of their continued support for capitalism.
Am I wrong in believing that the current media establishment is a problem and that free speech and the first amendment are not predicated on the existence of thus existing media establishment?\n\nHere I thought that corporate interests were what were ruining the country, yet when the *very same corporate interests, as manifested in the corporate media conglomerates*, are accused of not having the people's best interests in mind everyone loses their fucking minds.  What in the actual fuck?  \n\nI fully realize that there is a risk of the vacuum caused by the death of the existing media could be easily filled by something far worse, but to argue that the corporate media is somehow isn't just a facilitator of corporate manipulation of the country, and in some cases a willing participant, is assinine.\n\nWhether the sitting President is the one to tackle this problem, I don't know.  I suspect not.  However to pretend there's nothing wrong just because you don't like the one making the accusation is absurd.

"We reviewed the footage and have determined that the player was killed by a large group of monsters."
Anti-Semitic is a dog whistle for racist.  That is, anti-Semitic comments are racist and by the "one drop rule" of racism anyone making such comments is racist.  Of course, the best thing about accusations of racism is that it completely subsumes a person's personality such that even the most perfect Progressive  would be wholly tainted by a single racist utterance.\n\nThis generation's complete obsession with racism and bigotry, and (of course) stamping it all out is really weird and isn't going to end well at all.  People are so obsessed with race and it's turning into a pair of opposing cliques in the Progressives and the Alt-right; both are made up of ideologues, both are obsessed with racial purity and stamping out wrong-think.
Tbh stripping felons of voting rights is really fucked up anyway, it's a practice that needs to stop.  It's probably arguably unconstitutional, but since it's states doing it they don't run afoul of the same Constitutional issues.  What's the point of it anyway?  If you don't want criminals participating in our democracy, then just execute them and be done with it.  Somehow I doubt that'd be considered acceptable by a significant portion of the population.
I get solid mid-100s on a crusty Radeon 7850, this game does not require a beefcake GPU in any sense.
Jokes on them because Arabs are well known to be terrible soldiers.  Look at the stories about the Iraqi army, they desert at the drop of a hat and the commanders care more about their personal prestige than unit discipline.
In what way is the current media establishment the same thing as the free press?  Are you saying that a free press is impossible unless the status quo is maintained?\n\nWhy are the existing media conglomerates entitled to continued existence?  Do you suppose no new media would arise after the current one falls?  Or are you counting on some supposed tyrannical executive fiat that states no new media companies may form?\n\nIf the media could be proven to be acting knowingly against the public at large would you change your mind?  Because I'm not sure why the allegation that the media as it exists today is not acting in good faith should be so obviously absurd.
Sure, but I should have said "not sure if they have a meaningful impact" on the HoWA unique.  I'm not sure a small buff to life leech is going to significantly improve the build.\n\nCurious about the WEd cluster and other claw passive changes though.

I'm not sure if you realize this, but one can be a white supremacist without the trappings of Nazism.  That is, all Nazis are white supremacists but not all white supremacists are Nazis.  In fact, a white supremacist could adhere to any number of the same positions as a Nazi, without being a Nazi.  This is true because Nazism is a specific ideology, not some vague collective of any and all racist ideas.\n\nDo you also wonder if the person who made the comic also believe in Lebensraum, the superiority of (specifically) German culture, or the infallibility of the Fuhrer Adolf Hitler?  I only ask because those are things a Nazi would believe.  Failing to do so would place even the most fervent of white supremacists outside of the Nazi ideology, and probably get them into trouble in Nazi Germany despite their white supremacist views.\n\nIn closing, calling anyone with racist views a Nazi is not only stupid, but incorrect.  Please stop.

It's known as "white passing" and is enough to strip victim status from any minority.  The logic, if you want to call it that, is since these individuals can be white when they want to be that they don't actually suffer the same injustice as someone who is obviously non-white.\n\nYou may wish to think of it as a reversal of the one-drop rule, whereby even a hint of whiteness is enough to lump said minority in with the rest of the racist, sexist, Islamophobic white devils.  The Nazis would be proud, assuming there's any brotherhood amongst dyed in the wool racists.

Relevant red pill filled video: https://youtu.be/wNkDiBOO4H0 \n\nEdit: Crazy video series! Part two near the end talks about the trilateral commission and how most National Security Advisors have been members. Flynn wasn't but he appointed Juster who is. Third part of video series goes into the media members and their complicity. I'm still watching and swallowing this large pill...
#important \nPedes I'm at work and need help. I think I'm on to something, possibly 55d underwater backgammon. Trump's tweet said his comment was in response to a fox news story, but it didn't specify which one or exactly when! So the media jumped on the "debunked" Tucker segment (which is not really debunked just because the Swedish officials who have been actively censoring the situation say so). Anyway my question is what other story on Fox News could he be referring to? Did Fox cover the 14 year old who married the pedo that impregnated her? Or some other story that can't be debunked? I can't really search right now but I bet this is yet another chess move.
I bet it's the 14 year old that legally married the pedo that impregnated her. I just can't search right now. Did Fox News cover that story? A story which is impossible to "debunk"...
Oh I member. Now he's busy cucking all over Facebook
What in the actual fuck does ABC hope to accomplish by publishing the names of CCW license holders?
I just don't get it. Do people seriously believe Sessions, Flynn and Trump were all "hey Russian ambassador, tell Putin thanks for the hacking now what can we do for you in return?" This is all ridiculous. Time to fight back. Special prosecutor for Hill Shill, Loretta Lynch and DWS illegal campaign activities, classified emails and pay for play. Full scale investigation of Obama for current seditious activity, using NSA for sabotaging Trump before inauguration, using IRS to target political opponents, using our money to fund liberal groups, tanf corruption, the Iran deal, and uranium one. Also while we are at it put his birth certificate under a microscope and for the love of Kek, unseal his school records!
This. Think of how hypocritical it would be for Trump to say sanctuary states must follow federal law but not legal marijuana states. It's up to Congress to change the law.

Trump and Sessions made it clear it's up to Congress to legalize it nationwide. If he didn't enforce federal marijuana laws wouldn't that make him the biggest hypocrite in regards to sanctuary cities?
So let me see if I understand this. Bank of America fir instance was found guilty of screwing customers out of money, but instead of paying back the customers there was incentive to donate to liberal activist groups.

Rather, the plan is intended to supplement production after Play-Doh  **sales have increased 20 percent annually over the past five years.**\n\nYou can't make this stuff up.

Much of the "science" you are referring to is deeply flawed. They have even manipulated data to support the narrative. It's interesting how many on the left seem to worship science, except when it comes to statistics they don't agree with, genetic and biological differences, gender, and what constitutes a human life.
Yeah, Obama must be real angry with the firm that promoted his book.

#important question:\nAnyone reading this that thinks it's no big deal, would you feel the same way if billions that should have went to the US Treasury instead funded the NRA or pro-life groups?
I agree it is bullshit but the fact is there are no federal bathroom laws, there are federal marijuana laws though. I'm holding out hope that Trump is doing this to not look like a hypocrite when it comes to sanctuary cities. Law is law, it's up to Congress to legalize weed.
It does seem unbelievable that a former POTUS would be imprisoned, but it was also unbelievable to me that a former POTUS would actively try to unseat his predecessor... until now. We are in an age of firsts it seems.
It's so screwed up when you piece it all together. Check out this summary: https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/5xa0bi/paul_joseph_watson_on_twitter_if_obama_is/degmvqo What's even more screwed up is the only media to be taking the whole thing seriously is fringe conservative media. Nothing from the alphabet soup msm outlets. Even this am on CBS (I believe) they said Trump firing back after Russian fallout...yada yada. Never mentioned the wire taps.\n\nEdit: they are now talking about wire tap "accusations"

This is despicable. Seriously. Why are they forcing this issue so much? Less than 1% of the population is transgender, so why are they forcing the other 98% of CHILDREN to give up their right to privacy? I truly don't understand, and I am typically pro lgbtq. As adults we have all had interaction with this, ko big deal. I just question why they are literally forcing the issue with school age kids.
This is truly sad. The man should be arrested and imprisoned, instead he will marry the 14 year old child he impregnated. Sick
They can claim their kids that are in Mexico?!?

From what I read it's not criminal charges but a school investigation\n>The school district’s investigation will determine whether Rhode’s statements violated the state’s code of professional conduct, said OSPI spokesman Nathan Olson.\n\n\nRead more here: http://www.tri-cityherald.com/news/local/education/article133537274.html#storylink=cpy
On Fox News  Sunday Mo Elleithee said the press is an institution that is part of the bedrock of our democracy and it is dangerous to turn people against it. Well, if it's part of the bedrock of our *constitutional republic isn't it important for the msm to be honest, accurate, and credible? As Dan Rather said, "Facts and truth are not partisan. They are the bedrock of our democracy." There has been extreme bias and many examples of completely false and/misleading news from "trusted" and "neutral" sources. The President had a right to call them out on it just as much as they have a right to say what they do. Alerting people to the **fact** that the media is nothing more than a business with an agenda, has no affect on their ability to pursue that agenda. It's a shame that you can't trust what you read, and that applies to all second hand sources. That is why it's important to read or watch first hand as much as possible and read sources with opposing views, while applying critical thinking. Unfortunately, many do not take the time to do this and instead consider themselves "well informed" because they read trending Facebook posts.\n\nEdit: I forgot to even mention the blatant corruption and collusion revealed by wikileaks. The msm essentially acted as an extension of Hillary Clinton's campaign. Before you say wikileaks got their information from "Russian hacking", I'd like to remind you there is still zero hard evidence of this. The fact that the media and politicians repeat it like gospel does not make it true. Also, the source doesn't take away the validity of the information.
Links to articles/archives?
Any word on how Jeff Zucker got his job? I found nothing on Google.
It's a hard situation but it pisses me off that he has the nerve to say all that on national TV and call himself an American. I think anyone who is now an adult with no criminal record should be able to become permanent legal residents but not citizens. No right to vote. It just makes me angry he would say that because the whole point is he is not an American citizen and IMO should not be allowed to become one just because his mother broke the law.
There was a single issue that was a huge no for me with Rand but now I don't remember what it was. Amnesty, TPP, or refugees I think. He seems on board the train now though. I'd much rather him as Senate Majority Leader than Cuck Ryan.
Tucker is right and I might get a lot of hate for this opinion, but the fact is after the Flynn sabotage Sessions should have amended his statement.The opposition will stop at nothing and President Trump and everyone in the cabinet knows this (or should!). Mistakes like this can not happen. Period. Unless it's part of a chess move, which I am really hoping. Otherwise there's no explanation. Sessions seems genuine and innocent but still should have realized any opening given can become an Achilles heel. It was a no win situation but amending his state would have been infinately better than waiting for the globalists to strike.
Can't watch video right now
Happy birthday! We have the best stepdads
He discovered Russian operatives hacking my a$$. More like he found out Russians were being framed.
It should be revisited since it is in state interest. All you have to do is look at the additional costs of teaching English as a second language to see proof of that.

When eating less than 2000 cal/day your brain subconsciously freaks out and starts behaving differently due to being in 'starvation mode'.

You're making a (presumably) false assumption that it's an automated system that filters based on what users typically filter.

People seriously don't get this because MSM is *really good* at appearing sincere. They will do everything they can to maintain their reputation and come off as honest. They will convince you that every story reported was done to the best of their ability. They say they are never trying to attack people, but are trying solely to show the truth.\n\nWhat they don't tell you is all of the stuff they *don't* report (which is a fucking lot), and they will never report it if it doesnt fit into their narrative. They will *never* say their narrative except in board rooms.

"100% of women get with 10% of guys (aka Chads). This is because women are inferior minded, shallow, and non-intellectual beings who serve few purposes: sexual pleasure and reproduction. Unfortunately, women have been 'sexually liberated' and by giving such brainless organisms autonomy we have essentially doomed our race. Our genetic future is compromised because we started putting evolution by the wayside in favor of cosmetic breeding. I, for one, am far above average intelligence and have human qualities that should be passed on for generations for the success of our species. However, from what I've seen when attempting mating calls in the wild there is no hope for anyone of actual merit. Our future is all athletes with 1.5 GPAs until we take away the privileges that many women have become accustomed to as rights. This is honestly one of the few things that Islam got correct.

Should have marked this better, DM and I agreed it could make sense for the Fire Arrow damage to total 1d8, figuring you dull the arrowhead by wrapping it in cloth.\n\nFirebolt as in the cantrip, or is there a fire ammunition thingy I haven't found? \n\nI thought of making it STR or DEX for the save throw (like the Trip manevuer), just couldn't think how you would just overpower a rope that's tied around your legs before you fell. :/\n \nAlso thought you just get ADV on melee attacks against prone creatures (still really good, true)\n\nMy concern is making them too powerful or just plain poorly balanced, my DM is okay if I'm versatile from preparations beforehand and can carry all the equipment in realistic ways (dropped my tent to make more room in my backpack, for instance). \n\nI found rules for oil and whatnot, but couldn't find non-magical fire damage attacks short of smacking them with a lit torch. :/ \nAlso thought this kind of was working in the constraints of existing rules lol \n\nThaks for the input. 
Found this thread checking if anyone had thought of new ideas (I thought I was clever for coming up with shark V_V).\n\nAnway...\n\nSpirit of the Shark: \n\nSpirit Power: While Raging and not wearing heavy armor, any enemy that lands an unarmed attack or grapple is dealt 1d4 slashing damage. The spirit of the shark gives you a tough, rugged hide.\n\nAspect of the Beast: You gain swim speed equal to your walking speed, and are able to breathe underwater. In addition, you gain advantage on any Wisdom(Perception) checks relying on smelling the blood of organic creatures. \n\nTotemic Attunement: While raging, you can use your bonus action after hitting a target with a melee attack to cause the target to begin to profusely bleed. At the beginning of each of its turns, for as long as this condition lasts, the target must make a Constitution saving throw equal to the damage dealt, or take 1d4  damage as it continues to bleed.\n\nI do like the idea of blind sight with smell (if bleeding), but I main goal was an almost Water World barbarian. 
Yeah, think it was a Berserker.
Druids can only shape into beasts they've seen in some manner. A DM that doesn't keep this in mind could cause a Druid to begin to stagnate, especially a Moon Druid, where CR relevant beasts are a core component of their class. Had a level 11 Druid feel she only had bear and elementals for shapeshifting, in a game I was playing in.\n\nI've not run into this myself, but I would imagine a thoughtful DM could help a new Wizard expand his spellbook as well.
The songs played in the various clubs. I'm not even much of an EDM/techno fan and I liked them.\n
That last bit...sounds like incredible can of worms Best I can think, anyone wanting to cause a problem would just stay ahead of whatever the map radius is, and people who only defend one point could be counted as afk. \n\nI think being able to report issues in post lobby would be simplest for players, but it could be some time before Ubi reviews reports (if they need to analyze the match a player is reported for and decide it was offensive). It sounds like what Ubi is going for would put more effort on players, but (hopefully and presumably) , result in faster reviews per incident. \n\nPros and cons to both. I favor the former, partially because I'm lazy.
For styles, if you are confident in parry skills, try using her deflects. Gets you a shoulder pin or a light attack combo. \n\nPardoning that, a free GB or light attack 's probably most reliable. \n\nIf you can knock them down, your biggest confirmed damage combo: light light sweep heavy. They can't dodge the sweep if they're getting up, and you get a free heavy whenever they're down. 
Gah. What is this from? I know I've seen this before, and it'll drive me mad now. O_o
What about Orochi's that have gotten gud? :p
Matt: Have you had circumstances where you felt the mood of (generally decent) players turning negative? (frustrated, resentful, lack of agency, etc)\n\nIf so, what approach do you try to take to handle the situation? \n\nHad such an atmosphere during my last session,  need to talk with the player to get feedback.\n\nThanks, and happy plotting.
Bravo
That sounds pretty reasonable lol\nSaw a conqueror that got revenge from taking damage. 3 of us literally could not kill him. 
Pay rent from a physical check.
This might be my lack of seeing exploitive, skilled min-maxers but I've just seen it make the character busted at one specific niche (general something around dealing damage without receiving damage). as soon as they are in a context where that niche doesn't apply, they feel the investment.
You. I like you. 
I just saw this happen against a warden. Flashed right initially then swung left. Think I've seen this on Orochi (top then left) as well. 
That seems pretty close to what I had (apparently underestimated how far you can throw one lol) I'll bring up each to the DM and see what is verdict is.\n\nD'oh, looked up the word to make sure I had it right, then didn't check the spelling. 
I'm playing a Ranger in my first ever real foray into D&D, and so am near completely ignorant of 90% of the common knowledge as a player (the first time I saw a Beholder was in Dragon's Dogma). \nAs a ranger, I'm expected to know a lot about a favored enemy, kind of central to em. \n\nSo, generally my character is about as clueless as I am about things, but when it comes to my favored enemy I just let the DM talking head for me about what my guy would just know. Then get advantage on any rolls for the super obscure stuff about them (favored enemy). \n\nTL;DR DM filling in expected knowledge caps is okay. 
Ranger has proficiency with Simple and Martial weapons, figure a Deb Bullet still fires the same as a regular bullet from a sling?\n\nWould have to ask DM if he thinks Bola is simple (probably not), martial, or exotic.

Learning piano is one of those Someday goals of mine. When did you start learning and would you have any tips?
I forget if a Rakshasa can alter its shape from intrinsic powers, or if they need to cast a spell to do so (example of a Doppelganger vs mage casting polymorph). If the former, I don't believe an anti magic field would dispel current alterations, but would prevent one from being able to use any such supernatural abilities while in range. \n\nAt least, that is my understanding of supernatural abilities from previous editions. On mobile currently, so ability to look things up is limited. 
Fantastic
Don't know that I'd sell shortS Spare the Dying. Saves you from needing to get to the person who went down mid-fight, and use an action to stabilize them. A healer's kit or med check will stabilize them, butthey'll still be unconscious for some time (unless you have Healer feat or use magical healing).\n\nAlso, any effects that would instantly kill the target (Power word Kill, Beholder Death Ray, etc) don't. I forget if it just knocks them unconscious or negates spell entirely. But it's pretty significant. (Just fought a beholder who hit 58 hp fighter for 53 damage from death ray.\n\nOn mobile, probably typos in here
Well, it is a team buff. The caster lets so many people in on the effect. \n\nI believe the druid can learn/prepare it and maintain concentration of a spell in animal form. Could cast it, shift into a squirrel or something,  crawl into a pouch or pocket on the thief, and presto: they both get +10 stealth and can't be tracked by nonmagical means. \n\n\n....immediately regret trying to bring back presto
Had a coworker do a "git branch temp" before starting to teach him to pull with rebase. Ensured nothing was lost and he was able to better understand rebasing with the practice, and a bit what branches are. 
Well great. Now I need to watch the entire series again. 
The post specifies that they run in circles at least occasionally. How would an automated system know they're actually afk?\n\nThe report process is a bit too extensive, but it would hopefully make consequences more immediate and transparent for Ubi when they review reports. Look at how controversial Lol's tribunal is. They're aren't really good solutions to this problem.
Oh, so you'd want the absent player booted, and replaced with an AI?\nThat would work, I think. I'm used to LOL where the lobby is shut down if someone fails to pick.\n\nOr are you ralking about the match players Vs AI?
Wondering,  would making PK lights take more stamina solve the spam?
Literally started reading reading Sabriel 15 minutes ago. First time reading it since middle school.\n\nOh...supposed to have a question. How was your AMA?
There's a pattern  that whenever a legitimate controversy rises up (Sessions and Russia), Trump makes an outrageous claim.  It distracts from the genuine issue until it has blown over. He's done similar acts throughout his campaign and presidency. Off hand the "millions of illegal voters " claim a while back. 
Could you recommend what tools/practices would most please you?\n\nUbi is starting this system in reaction to our complaints. Constructive criticism is being noted.
On mobile right now, so haven't been able to check it out yet.\n\nI'm working on something very similar with Dragon Age RPG, as a personal project. \n\nMy biggest hurdle (besides data entry because...bleh) was defining my db schema. Ended up learning some NoSQL and mongoDB to handle the "lawl, structure"-structure RPG systems. Curious to what your approach was?
a sneaky rogue under Pass Without Trace: 37 stealth in their worst case scenario....gah. \nThe game suddenly becomes Elder Scrolls.
*Takes all of your movement to light. \nIdea was it takes X seconds to move 30 feet, and Y seconds to ignite the arrow and let the fire spread, and you can't do both and still attack the same turn. \n\nStill getting used to this not dividing actions into things like Major, Minor, Free, etc. 
Retreat implies destination,  at best this is breaking rank and fleeing with disregard lol
I can both assure everyone that he did in fact turn into a sheep, and confirm that it was hilarious. 
I'm not sure why he so wants a Str to hit bow, so it's difficult to give an answer.\n\nIf your player wants his character to be this BA archer who can fell beasts out of the sky: I'd recommend looking at the Greatbows from Dark Souls. \n\nTo spec that out on a napkin, start with a Heavy Crossbow, add a Str requirement, and bump the damage to 1d12 + Str. If that feels unsatisfying, can give another detriment (i.e bowstring breaks on a Nat 1) and add a benefit (i.e triple damage on crits), depending on your game.\n\nIf your player just wants to hit more with his bow, add a Feat that lets players learn a Fighting Style, and tell him he can take Archery for a +2 to hit.\n\nIf your player just wants to hit more with his bow and doesn't care about game balancing, then I feel bad for you son.
Read the article, which I'll link here for ease of access.\n\nFrom it: 'In it, she said Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) were “real pioneers when it comes to school choice."'\n\nThe article is critical of this remark, citing from the Department of Education, "The Department of Education states on its own website that HBCUs were established because 'there was no structured higher education system for black students.'"\n\nI was not able to confirm that quote on the DE website, but did find the definition as, "“…any historically black college or university that was established prior to 1964, whose principal mission was, and is, the education of black Americans, "\n\nThey're critical because DeVos' statement seems to show a lack of understanding on the foundation and social climate these schools began in.\n\nOriginal article: http://www.independent.co.uk/news/education/education-news/betsy-devos-historically-black-universities-colleges-set-up-pioneers-of-choice-a7603441.html\n\nD.E HBCU: https://sites.ed.gov/whhbcu/one-hundred-and-five-historically-black-colleges-and-universities/
May be a bit late, but you should check out the Exercise out of depression subreddit. /r/EOOD if I remember correctly. 
Would also like to know. Most duels I'm in feels like against sandbags
MMR. Gear Score will depend on what class they play and what loadout they use. MMR reflects the skill of the players, that is consistent across any match.\n\nDifferent MMR between game modes *should* help to make matchmaking more fair, and not punish people for trying unfamiliar game modes.
I read that! Rather enjoyed it, I like that I rarely know where Gaimen's books are going, or where they'll end up.
Really like the idea of the Con save. Might do it at 8+proficiency+damage. On a fail, unconscious with 1 death fail, on a pass, crit damage. 
The 1d8 is the total damage, should have specified. Figure you kind of dull the arrow head by wrapping it in cloth, so target only really gets hurt by the fire. \n\nBreaking off the shaft was the counter option I had in mind for em, yeah. Figure it's probably trivial enough to say "I do it" vs something like a DC 3 Strength check. 
You do realize that virtually everything he has done in his career has been about deception and conspiring against others in the name of the right wing agenda, right? Why don't you look up what he was planning against CNN correspondent Abbie Boudreau in 2010. He has an axe to grind.
Well, remember that Pike was still Astral Projection-ing during the whole episode of it. I think magical abilities couldn't be used (the energy required would be absorbed), but they aren't dispelled either. \n\nAstral Projection Pike wasn't able to heal Vex, but she wasn't dispelled (aside from when her Skype died, which I take as Matt rolling with the punches).
Regarding:\n"A specific circumstance in which you should avoid using git pull --rebase is if you merged since your last push."\n\nIf you configure pull to preserve merges with rebase ([pull] rebase = preserve) should keep any merges (local or on remote) whenever you pull, right?
Blind sight may have been a better comparison. Just reread how good True sight. 
I think failing ready checks ending the lobby would be good. However it looks like the issue here is people getting into games and then going afk, relying on team to win while they get xp regardless. 
Generally companies aim to discourage practices that allow one player to harm the enjoyment of other players. This griefing/afk technique seems to fall under that category. 
5 level 5's, (Ranger [me], Druid, Sorcerer, Fighter, and Warlock) are following the trail of a man who has organized hill giants and kidnapped my family. \nI have a quiver from Azuth, which essentially casts daylight twice a day.\n\nWe're walking along, and suddenly two hill giants are teleported in about 20 feet to our left and white. I have Alert, but roll a horrible initiative. Both hill giants throw rocks at our Fighter, dealing near 50 damage and taking him down in the surprise round. \n\nI yell for everyone to scatter, and throw down a 2nd level fog cloud centered on the fighter. Druid brings fighter up, Warlock doesn't move and takes dodge action, sorcerer dashes and moves out to where I am (was 100-feet ahead of rest of party). The giants rush to where they last saw the fighter and try to attack blindly. \n\nI ask DM if I can get enough impression of where the fight is happening to have an clue where to shoot. Pass a perception check, and declare an attack with a daylight arrow on the giant I can hear. He says I can do it, but roll with disadvantage. I use inspiration,  attack...Natural 20. The arrow soars like a meteor and slams into his head. It's now a fight against a 2 blind giants, one with a beacon shining off his head. We attack with him advantage, he with disadvantage, and we destroy him. \n\nTl;dr embedding a daylight arrow into a giant in a fog cloud was awesome.

Cool clip, but it feels like any Deathmatch/Dominion highlight needs to specify item levels to be impressive or not. :/
Are they reverting the guard break counter to what it was in the beta in the next patch?  (1.0.3?) Still waiting for that to land on ps4, the new guard break is just not wiring into my brain. 
Hm...I think I like this as the best Ranger interpretation I've seen so far. \nA few concerns and questions, however. Currently on mobile, apologies for poor formatting.\n\nI'm not sure about the Hunter having access to each offensive trait (first tier). I didn't feel much issue with committing to one. With some only working on reactions, it's unlikely they would be used.\n\nSide thought: I did feel that Colossus Slayer was a bit strong when I played though, I'm curious if it would work better if it kicked in when they were half health. \nEnd side thought.\n\nBlood Frenzy seems much stronger than the other options, as it is essentially advantage on every attack. I might make that more like a Barbarian's Reckless Attack, where they can choose to attack with advantage, but all attacks against them also have advantage. \nAlso, would the companion benefit from the selected traits?\n\n10 seems like a high ceiling for intelligence, I think that is average intelligence for sentient creatures. Concerned the companion would almost be a separate PC/NPC of the party. Awaken spell may be a good parallel for this, I believe it works on any creature with an intelligence below 4. If this narrows the field of candidates too much, might add Fey to the roster.\nSo, a ranger could have a companion that is any Beast, Fey, or Monstrosity with an intelligence less than 4, of an appropriate CR.\nHm...seems a lot of things have intelligence  <=4. Maybe 6? (Referencing a bestiary app with some stats)\n\nAnyway,  overall seems very good on a first read through.
They also do not list the tools used for analysis. The best I could think of would be somehow find the IP addresses used for profiles, or a geotag Facebook keeps for profiles. Either would limit the profiles to a geographic area, not a specific individual. 
Oh, seems my question is on the wrong comment. That's a bit awkward....So, um, how are you today? 
Joan of Arc and Mark Twain
Hm. Yeah. However,  there is already a lot of pushback on Ubo about how inconsistent matchmaking is. If they made this change, would it be acceptable that more lobbies would be dropped because >=1 out of 8 users failed to ready after 70 seconds (or whatever the max time period is to ready)?\n\nI think so, but I could understand concern of making one problem worse when trying to address another. 
Sunlight
Those racial benefits can be so fantastic, and mirror certain feats. \n\nAs the only human in an elf-heavy party, learned darkvision as my second level spell (Ranger), to be able to use what they always have up. \n\nI don't get why people say variant is over-powered, it allows more customization which I guess can help get min-maxed builds sooner

Pike was able to sustain Astral Projection while in the range. (Pike was still physically in Vasselheim at the time)\n\nThis could be Matt not wanting Ashley to sit out this encounter, or could be a hint at how this area works. Since this thread is about internal consistency, it seems worth bringing up, and often forgotten. 
You can full guard -> shield bash very quickly.\nConq's best tool for opening someone up, in my experience.
Your Lie in April was fantastic. Well...first half and end episode in particular. Kind of show I have a hard time recommending to people though.

I see it as a comeback mechanic, similar to what's in Mortal Kombat.
25/M/USA So would it be safe to assume that you like RWBY? (RT, anime, superheroes :P)\n\nI know that solitary feel, message me and I can explain why I am something of a RWBY fan girl. ^_^
Went and searched for the song after reading this, it's terrific. You have earned my upvote.
Oh yeah, did pick up a grappling hook a while back, but didn't really think of using it as ammunition. Seems like it would be difficult to fire accurately? \n\nCame up with Barbed arrow to be used best in conjunction with Cordon of Arrows. 
virtualenv and virtualenvwrapper are pretty fantastic. 
Didn't have book on me. Was thinking of Death Ward. Slight difference. 
It has to be case on a target within 90 feet, I think after that it sticks to them until the spell is broken.
House-ruling that human variants get the skilled feat, instead of an extra skill. (2 more skills/tools they can choose)\nStarting the game in about a week, so will see how it plays out)\n\nPlaying a human variant ranger now, and the race feels a bit weak compared to party (high/wood elf and half-elf). I imagine it is really good if you are trying to min/max a character (or any circumstance where character focuses just on a certain thing),  but haven't tried
"I am haunted by waters" - A River Runs Through It. Book had a lot of great prose. 
Gotta admit, aside from light attack damage, none of those are what I had in mind. I expected longer deflect and shoulder thrust windows, and changes to her stamina. Being strictly better with more mixups is also good though :D
No one ever watches the white side. >_>\n\n"an clue"\n\nso much shame. 
Have you used your full guard?
Interesting, when my schema started turning into an octopus I looked into NoSQL. Dragon Age RPG is a bit cluttered, and I kind of went to meticulous detail on storing some things. Everything is still kind of early, have been a bit slow on it lately. (Using Django, MongoEngine, and their Rest-Framework extensions)\n\nReeeaallly not looking forward to actually dumping all the data in. lol 
Look at the difference of the fresh posts. It's not even close. I wonder if digital/streaming would have helped Dr La Soul.
Don't apologize. Based on the lack of Canadian team cup wins over the past several decades, it's easy to get confused. 
RTJ 3 just fucked the list up.\n
Shit. I'm officially old. I don't agree with how she handled it, and believe that this is somewhat staged, but I can get why a parent would be concerned about a 14 year old listening to hip hop. She also probably put off the "the talk" with him or just left it up to the school to deal with.
It's called a "Luthor". 
That albatross is going to be hanging around Houston's neck for a while.

Are there any good releases this week I should check out?
I'm a fan of Gucci, it's just these rappers that you literally have to read a lyric booklet to understand their rapping. Don't get me wrong, I listen to different genre's of metal where that's how it is, but most of these new-wave trap rappers aren't producing their own beats. What the hell are people actually fans of?
I have yet to listen to the whole thing. I did think he built on his previous works
I'll add flossing and getting regular(6 months/yearly) cleanings to this. Last year Last year I went to the dentist for the first time in a little over a decade. Several fillings, 2 root canals, and about 2k out of pocket later, my mouth is now about as healthy as it can be.\n\nBrush, floss, get cleanings. It's better than not doing it. Trust me.
I'm not sure if it's been abandoned, a stray, or someone's cat they let out. It looks a little too clean to be a lifelong stray, but I'm also not an expert. I don't think it's fixed either, but again, I'm not an expert.
I think the gripe is, year one was basically a beta people shelled out $90 USD for. Everything prior to TTK really didn't matter.
There's Wegmans near me, and they have a self serve loose leaf tea area. That's my go to now. 
They will. Destiny felt like a beta test, and they still haven't figured out how to not piss off their fan base. If I purchase Destiny 2, it won't be for a several months after release. 
For what it's worth, I'm in metro-west Massachusetts and have no desire to travel to NYC. The cost of traveling, tickets, and a hotel/Air BNB is too much for me. It would also be a gigantic pain in the ass. That's at least a 5 hour drive.
It reads like most of the titles do at r/the_Donald. It's probably bullshit.
I have this same problem. I'm trying to reinstall it, but at like 1% - 1.5% percent downloaded it crashes.
Which is better, choice 2 or 3 for the thesan? Should I hold on to the order for another roll?
Honestly, I took most of /r/The_Donald as being a big inside joke.
I think C goes a bit further than just how they're portrayed by sportswriters. I don't think David Ortiz is disliked by other players the same way those other guys were.
keep that stick on the ice, man. 
I made the 2010 midterm election comparison to 2016 a few times as well. The smugness of the establishment democrats has been their undoing again.
Ricky, get your hands off the fajitas.
I dunno man. I know nothing about cultural views towards violence or hockey in China, but the whole thing looked pathetic. No one did anything. The zebras just let that shit continue to happen, and the Red Star(s?), my god. They just sat back and watched a bunch of their teammates get punched in the face repeatedly. The victims didn't even seem to fight back for godsakes. Is their main advertiser Charmin ultra soft toilet paper? Pathetic.
I wonder if we're going to see some version of the sinister six built up over the course of a few movies with this reboot.
Yeah, I did. I wasn't too much of a fan of the rapping. 
There's nothing to understand. This did not happen. It's a fabrication from the childfree subreddit.
There's a small place in worcester called Sol De Mexico that is really good
Wow. I'm glad I live in Massachusetts. Fish and chip's usually runs around $10 here. Hell, this one place in town will give you a platter of fried fish, shrimp, scallops, clam strips and clam bellies with fries for about $23.00.
You know, it's awfully transparant who and what you are. Throwaway user name that's only used to promote Clinton/ and smear everything else. How much is CTR paying you?
Did he actually knock them out, or did they flop on the ground because they didn't want to fight and or get penalized? \n\nTo the point you brought up, it was pathetic. How the fuck are you going to sit there and watch some dude going around attacking your team mates one after the other. I'm not familiar with the KHL culture or their rules, but those mother fuckers are softer than baby shit. HC Kunlun Red Stars are so soft, they have a thread count.
Shoot, they got em good. How's the Game gonna get out of this one? /s
As an artistic medium, it really bums me out that there aren't more hiphop projects like Deltron 3030.
For easy meals, get some gallon sized (freezer) bags and throw together some stuff they can just dump into it and turn on the crock pot for a meal. There are plenty of recipes that are literally "put this stuff in the crockpot, turn it on low for 8 hours". Boom, dinner and some leftovers depending on the family size. Hell, even vegetable trimmings and bones can be used to make broths for soups and stews later on.\n\nPS - Good luck to your friends. They're lucky to have someone thoughtful like you in their lives.
What are you looking for? Liquid Swords by GZA is a classic. Newer stuff? The new Tribe album was great.
It's not universal, but it is very prevalent. Especially when a white person is using "ghetto" as a way to insult a black person.
She also didn't go to that college. The event happened at UMASS Amhearst and she "went" to nearby Hampshire college. The place is known to be a joke.

I'm guessing there's a clause that the label has to handle her social media presence. You know, since she gives Trump a run for his money in social gaffes.

Yankees fan in MA here. I was so sure the Red Sox would be terrible this year. I didn't account for the fact that everyone else in the AL East would be just about as bad.\n\nMy name is Dan. I confidently told my coworkers that "Nostradanas" predicted a year of defeat and embarrassment for the Red Sox. I bet that if they finished the season with a winning record, I would wear a Red Sox hat for a month. I'm now shopping for a Red Sox hat. Goddamnit. I'm just glad I didn't go so far as saying I'd get a tattoo or something.
I'm from Massachusetts, you and everyone in the union can have some of ours. I used to live in a "city" that had like 6.
This should be for any personal calls. Most businesses that are above mom and pop level record most things over their phones anyway. \n\n
You just described what has been beginning/happening in my City for the past 4-5 years. Large groups of young men saying "Bikes up, guns down". The ironic part is there has been at least one one instance of someone being shot while the robber stole the dirt bike at gun point.\n\nI never implied the guy was a junkie. Not at one single point.
That's why I voted for Scott Brown. She and the democrats in this state believed the seat belonged to them. That sense of entitlement cost them.

Does anyone know why Birdman/Cash Money has decided to hamstring Lil Wayne's career? At first I thought Bridman/Cash Money was unsatisfied with Tha Carter 5. Now it just seems like Birdman/Cash Money wants to bury Wayne's career. 
The worst part is, their unethical behavior didn't end there. I work for a credit union where we saw a huge increase in fraud coming in from Wells Fargo. Clearly fraudsters saw how easy it was to open accounts and exploited that.
No. They occasional write stories that expose corruption/fraud in the area, but for the most part they're just a clickbait website. Their actual blog is absolutely atrocious with the amount of ads on it, and most of their articles revolve around trashy people that are in New England.
I'm curious how they're going to handle the new anti-clickbait algorithms facebook will be implementing. They're basically buzzfeed meets a New England version of TMZ.\n\nI was on board when they uncovered the Mosaic Cultural Complex was a sham, but most of their stuff is just trashy and pathetic.
Everyone involved in this sketches me out. Where the fuck were the cops? Why did their citizens arrest feel like they were trying escalate the situation without geting too aggressive?\n\nEdit - also, the dude trying to fuck teenagers needs to be put in prison for a long time. Who knows what would have happened if he met an actual kid.
Just give Sleeper Agent McDaniels a chance. Look at the Texans. If they hadn't dumped a ton of money on their backup QB, they very well could have won that game last week.
Good luck posting Turtleboy Sports links here or in the Worcester_MA subreddit. Not a lot of people want to read a blog written by a Worcester townie who spends more time jamming ads onto their site than proofreading their articles.
You don't instinctively catch things. Your instinctive response would be to swipe at it and bat it away.
Uh, your husband is as fucked as Cash. Your husband is okay with a 30 something year old loser treating your house like a motel that charges by the hour. Except, you don't charge anything and you prepare this creep special meals. All of this after he tells you and your husband that he's going to fuck your sister, Greg's 17 year old sister in law. You need to go to counseling with your husband or divorce him. This is completely unacceptable. BTW, this was written by a guy in his thirties. None of this is normal. In fact, it sounds an awful lot like that show "Cuckoo" on Netflix.
The prices of seeing Boston sports teams play makes me want to live in a small market area. I've never been to a Pats game, and I've only been to Bruins/Sox/Celtics games when I won raffles from work. Getting into Boston from Worcester sucks any way you do it, and it adds on to that ticket cost by a decent amount.
Maybe they let it sit long enough before cutting/serving? It seems dumb to me though.
The source of the leak doesn't matter as much as what was being done behind closed doors. I don't understand why people are buying this shift in the narrative. \n\nThe Democratic party is weaker because of all the shady backroom collusion and the outright disdain for infosec. 
Do you honestly see the Jays, or Orioles winning the World Series, or the ALCS?\n\nEdit - Highest I'll go is mediocre.
I mostly meant things that leave a trail. Things like passport(s), bank accounts, cell phones, etc. For all they know a wanted man has been in their home for 5 months.  
No. No breaks for you. The Red Sox decided to pull a candy-assed move, and paid for it. Throw all of the stats you want at me, Lester isn't mentally weak like the Red Sox starters proved themselves to be this year.
The writer of this article thinks people dislike A-Rod *just* because of his history with PED scandals. Take a fan from any other team and ask them to put a list together of memorable A-Rod moments. I doubt many of the things that make the list are for positive play on the field. I'm not saying he wasn't talented, I'm just saying he didn't help himself throughout his career. The negative outshines the positive.
Young Thug's album/mixtape dropped the same day I think. It got way more attention from this sub. 
Do you dress yourself, or do you get help with that every morning? He's specifically saying it for the reaction and hate.
In your defense, what other purpose does a grappling hook have? You know, besides climbing and swinging...

"Dating". Lets be real here, no sane 33 year old wants to "date" an 18 year old girl. \n\nOP mentions he "doesn't believe in technology", and he's dead broke. How broke and how "off the grid" is this guy? Broke and off the grid to the point where he doesn't have a bank account? They should run a background check on this guy. Maybe he is some selfish dirty hippie, or maybe he's hiding.
He can start by telling them his employer helped rig a primary.
Seriously? First off, I'm pretty sure 15 year olds have to be tried as adults to be executed in most, if not all states. Second, a child forced into a marriage with an adult man would not see that kind of charge in 2016. Stop excusing away savagery. \n\nEdit. - I was wrong, she wasn't forced into it. Still, doesn't explain a teenager being sentenced to death given her circumstances.
I don't think it's unfair to describe everything that came before TTK as a beta Bungie fleeced players into paying $120.00 for. \n\nIf I learned anything from Destiny and The Division, it's to wait at least one month after the release date to begin considering buying a game. I'm not saying I won't play Destiny 2, but I'm not going to be first in line for it.
Unfortunately for your degenerate fanbase, the tuck rule wasn't fake. Nor was it a bad call. 100% legit baby. Deal with it.
This looks amazing. Absolutely amazing.
The switch flipped because Trump can barely be stomached by the rest of the GOP, let alone most rational people. I see you're from New Jersey. Even Chris Christie has begun to distance himself from Trump. Based on the debates, I'm not even sure Mike Pence can stomach being in the same room long enough to work as a cohesive team with Donald.\n\nWhile we're talking about Mike Pence, his time as governor of Indiana has shown why he does not deserve to be anywhere near that position of power. His policies led to one of the worst outbreaks of HIV that this country has seen. He lead the the Economic Development Corporation that rewarded companies for sending jobs out of America. Last but not least, it's been reported that Indiana has lost $60 million due to the "religious freedom" law he signed. An amount that has probably grown since the article was published back in January.\n\nIn closing, Hillary and the DNC cheated Sanders out of the primary. This is something I won't forget. I voted for Romney in 2012, and I would have voted for him again had he run. As an independent voter, I can't vote for the Trump - Pence ticket. They're just too stupidly dangerous for their own good.
I haven't really cared much for the direction of the show since Netflix gave them money. There was a certain charm the earlier seasons have that the new ones don't have.\n\nThe one thing that worries me is the longtime characters that are leaving. Almost every new character they've introduced has been unlikable, or just flat out poorly written.
I'm pretty much doing what this guy said. I'm on a Mass Effect trilogy play through right now. I'm still on the fence about buying Andromeda on release day. I was pretty disappointed with Destiny and The Division. The hype was greater than the end product.
I have a charged one\n
This is just the opinion of an internet stranger, but you may want to talk to someone at your local police department regarding this situation. At the very least, they may be able to give you information on your state's laws and regulations when it comes to squatting rights.
No, she just wants to call her a nigger without the social repercussions. Ghetto and thug are just used as synonyms for that word now. Look at the sentence structure and the way ghetto is used.
I'm just curious as to why the visiting team put the goon out on the ice. Wasn't this a preseason game?
It's happened before. Josh Koschek comes to mind. Anyway, you'd have to be out of your mind to show up to a professional fighter's gym and challenge them.
Have you ever watched Trailer Park Boys? That's why. Before you know it, you'll have the drunk trailer park supervisor watching you like a shithawk.
His name is rod_mikey on instagram. He's was in jail or still is. The reason: being an asshole. Maybe *he* owned his dirtbikes/ATVs but the people in Worcester don't. They've robbed people at gunpoint for them, they drive stupidly in groups, and have been caught drinking while doing donuts at public parks/sports fields. These are not people you should be sticking up for. Most of them are gang members.
Nah, those wikileaks emails were Russian propaganda. The 30+ years of baggage Hillary came with was imaginary. She won the primary fair and square.\n\n\nIt's like these people are delusional. They can't admit their candidate was terrible.
I still can't tell if people actually like him as an artist or like shit-positing about him.
Yeah, duderbot508. I forgot what to do with it though.
Because my back is screaming in agony and I can barely feel my feet.
People didn't understand the fundamental difference between nuclear weapons and conventional bombs (and some still don't) back then. The long-term contamination was especially poorly understood. Up until the 1970s or so, the US military had a [shoulder-fired nuclear weapon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Davy_Crockett_\\(nuclear_device\\)) which would have given the soldier firing it a dangerous dose of radiation.
I go hiking a lot, and it does suck when you see trash laying around, but most of it isn't from people littering. It's from people who accidentally drop stuff from their pack, or from people who don't keep a tight lid on their trash or recycling at home and it gets blown away. Mowed lawns and paved streets are smooth and wilderness and waterways are sticky, so the trash always ends up there. If you talk about how much you hate litter in a group, they'll all agree with you, but half of them will have uncovered trash cans at home or loose wrappers in their car waiting to blow out the window.
People do this on hiking trails sometimes, and it's pretty annoying. Not only are you disrupting the peace and tranquility that the rest of us are out there trying to enjoy, but you're also scaring off all of the wildlife we want to see. 
A year or so ago one of my neighbors had a smoke detector that was doing the low battery chirp for days. I brought the neighbor I thought had the issue a fresh battery to put in, and she took it. When the sound didn't stop, I went back a few hours later and told her I brought her the (9 volt) battery for her smoke detector, and she said "Oh, our smoke detector doesn't need a battery, I thought it was for the remote control." \n\nSo I go get another new battery and stand outside trying to triangulate the sound. I identified the source and brought them a battery, which the guy who came to the door took and acted like he wasn't aware that it had been chirping for days. Hours later I went back and talked to a woman there and explained that I brought them the battery so they'd put it in the smoke detector, and she finally did it. I have no fucking idea how they could stand it for days like that.
One of my friends played Barney for kids parties. He had the voice 100% down. The suit was very hot and he would sweat off a few pounds of water. It was pretty easy to get into and he would put it on over his clothes at his car. It was a little hard to move in but Barney doesnt do much acrobatic stuff. 
I have some facebook friends that are always posting dumb right wing and especially "natural news" stuff about vaccines, vitamin c curing cancer, etc. A couple of them have deleted my replies or complained about me debunking their shit on their page, so I just post it on my page and say "one of my friends posted this and this is why it's wrong."
Well, people tend to release their sphincter and bladder when they die, and 4 year olds are particularly prone to that. As you struggle to breathe, it will be a race between the weight of the corpses crushing you to death and the shit and piss soup that you're aspirating drowning you, so I'd change "honourable" to "horrible."
Oxygen really is toxic, as is pure "dihydrogen monoxide." Oxygen is very corrosive, and people who need supplemental oxygen suffer from oxygen toxicity if they are on it at high concentrations for enough time. 
No, it's like you telling a nurse that she's doing a shit job because she's not stopping the firefighters from starting fires.

Way to throw them off your trail!
Nothing, but the reason the White House has daily briefings is so they can manage the news a little and give their take on things. In the absence of that, they'll have to face the scrutiny of investigative reporting replacing that news coverage. It's in the White House's interests to hold the briefings and to allow all of the outlets to participate. They could much more effectively quash reporting from outlets they don't like by simply not calling on them to ask questions at the briefings.

I have a question about 1st generation red dwarf stars. I understand that small red dwarf stars have lifespans in the trillions, or even hundreds of trillions of years, but we don't see any red dwarf stars that don't have metals (stuff heavier than lithium) in them which would need to be created inside other earlier generations of stars. I have read some theories about planet formation that suggest that heavy elements are required for the formation of smaller planets through accretion, but with only lighter elements available, gas giants can still form through gravitational anomalies. Could the same  thing be required for the formation of small stars, too? If that's not a plausible explanation or if you have some insight on why we don't see 1st generation red dwarf stars around, I'd love to hear it.
This is correct, but it was most often used to point out that someone was claiming to have done something impossible. It was the 19th century equivalent of "Quit your bullshit."
They can also [distinguish between human languages](http://www.upi.com/Researchers-find-elephants-can-tell-languages-apart/61311394555133/) and recognize the languages spoken by people that are more likely to be a threat to them.
More to the point, they included other outlets that aren't part of the press pool, and are under no obligation to share the information they get. The press pool has to make all of the info they get available to the other reporters that weren't present.
Like I said, he's not a great orator. From his writing, it's clear that he had a deep understanding of the policies he is a proponent for. You should check out his bestseller book [Our Revolution](https://www.amazon.com/Our-Revolution-Believe-Bernie-Sanders/dp/1250132924).

When people say X dollar company they usually mean the market capitalization of the company, not how much they control of their customer's assets. The most valuable company in the world is Apple, at around $665 billion, but there are a number of banks that control more than $1 trillion in assets.
The ballpark number of species would be about the same, but like you said, the types we'd have would be different, and that would affect the number of species, too. \n\nSpecies that don't get around much during their lives tend to have lots of different species in the same family because their geographic isolation makes their evolution diverge from their cousins up the road. For example, most species of beetles have a home range of less than a thousand square meters, and there are over 400,000 known species of beetle in the world, which is about 25% of all described animals. The biologist J.B.S Haldane wrote "The Creator would appear as endowed with a passion for stars, on the one hand, and for beetles on the other..." because there are so many. \n\nBefore the Permian extinction event, about 2/3 of animals in the ocean were sessile, or attached to stuff for their whole lives like barnacles are today. Stationary animals couldn't move with their appropriate climate like moving animals could, so after the Permian extinction event, only about half of the animals in the ocean were sessile. Fewer sessile species means fewer species that quickly diverge from their neighbors because they don't mix genes with each other for a while.
Bernie's site had extremely detailed plans for all of his policies. He's not a great orator but he wasn't short on details.
Hopefully the Gates Foundation has endowed a burn unit or two.

Certain types of cancer (as far as we know) only develop if you have a specific viral infection. HPV to cervical cancer is the most commonly known one, but there are others. There are some cancers that can be transmitted directly, but they are very rare in humans. The Tasmanian Devil facial tumors that /u/LadyFoxfire mentioned is one. Then there's [this poor bastard](http://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2015/11/04/454066109/a-man-in-colombia-got-cancer-and-it-came-from-a-tapeworm) who caught cancer from a tapeworm.

I have read that the James Webb Telescope will be able to study the atmospheres of some exoplanets orbiting bright stars. Do you expect it to be able to tell us anything about the atmosphere of these planets orbiting so close to such a dim star? 
To calculate the acceleration, you need to have derived the "Fg" part of your equation, which is what the formula I gave does. All of the necessary terms to calculate the acceleration are in Newton's formula (the force and the masses,) and more to the point, you claimed my formula was wrong, but you now acknowledge that it's Newton's, not mine, and presumably admit that he knew what he was talking about, lol.
Sure, all 5 kinds!
The important question is...what's in Document1???
The formula for gravity is F = Gm1m2/r^2, where m1 and m2 are the 2 masses and r is the distance between their centers of gravity, and G is the gravitational constant 6.67408 × 10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2. If we change m1 to 0.68m1, we get F=G(0.68m1)(m2)/r^2, and we can factor out the 0.68 to get F= 0.68(Gm1m2/r^2 )
There is no burden of evidence on me. You edited your comment and that is plainly visible to anyone who looks. You have been kind of a dick throughout this thread, also plainly visible to anyone who looks. All the evidence for Newton knowing what he was talking about I need is in the first post that you claimed was wrong, which is also plainly visible to anyone that looks. What say we just move on? I'll even let you get the last word, since you strike me as the type that values that. Go ahead and insult me one more time for the road.
The polls leading up to the election disagree with you.

Yeah, the comment he was replying to had a typo I think, and she meant to say "68% of," not "68% lower."
Yes, lots. The [horseshoe crab](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horseshoe_crab) evolved 445 million years ago, right in the midst of hte [Ordovician–Silurian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordovician%E2%80%93Silurian_extinction_events) extinction events and has survived the other 4 major extinction events and lots of minor ones. This [chart](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/06/Extinction_intensity.svg) shows the extinction record since ~~multicellular~~ *complex* life first evolved around 600 million years ago, and the horseshoe crab (which is a super weird animal with copper based blood instead of iron, like a Vulcan, and whose blood is blue, not green like Star Trek would have us believe) has survived all since the one labelled "O-S."
I don't get particularly mad about theft. The person stealing stuff isn't doing it to hurt you, they're doing it because they want stuff. Personal crimes are much more offensive to me, when someone does something to you with the goal of hurting you.
And most of us have practiced saying "pay a fine" and "pay a fee" in the car.
So that ~~you~~ **u** can be beautiful.
You edited your initial post. You originally claimed that all you need is Fg = ma, which is incorrect. It's OK to be wrong once in a while kid. That's how you learn.
He still hasn't turned over his mailing list. You probably can't understand this, but Bernie is a man of honor. He would never have the support of his fanbase if he didn't have an absolute personal incorruptability that rivals Pericles's.
Yeah it's not the exact same thing as what Trump's man did today, but there was a lot of apologist articles trying to claim Obama's guys didn't do anything wrong at the time, which wasn't true. Fox News ended up getting a front row seat in the briefing room not long after this happened.
The 90s was when Hot Topic was pushing those stupid "Pornstar" shirts. The only part that makes it $100% true is that she says she made them instead of saying she bought them at the mall.
That's not really true. The number of ~~orders~~*phyla* has declined (all ~~orders~~*phyla* of organisms except for one evolved during the Precambrian explosion for reasons that aren't understood yet) but the number of species rebounds pretty quickly. After the P-T extinction, it took about 10 million years for there to be as many different species as there were before. Other mass extinctions recovered more quickly, but except for the close together Ordovician and Silurian, they all started with about the same number of different species.
It detailed how his programs would be paid for, if that's what you mean, and it didn't rely on some pie in the sky 3.5% growth rates.
The weight of a mass is literally the mass times the acceleration...You must be the other guy's other account, I guess. I give up, you can go ahead and get the last word too if you'd like.

Besides this stuff, centuries of colonialism and post-colonial instability have contributed quite a bit. It wasn't always like this; In the time of the High Roman Empire, the Aksum empire (Horn of Africa extending inland) was considered to be one of the 4 great civilizations of the world. Sub-Saharan Africa was a land of unbelievable wealth. \n\nThe same region (Horn of Arica, extending up to Sudan) is the most likely candidate for the Land of Punt, which Egypt did lucrative trade with a thousand years before the Trojan War. They sent vast amounts of gold, incense, spices, ivory, and wood into Egypt. Queen Hatshepsut of Egypt built a fleet to trade with Punt and other civilizations on the Red Sea, and pretended in temple reliefs that Punt was sending tribute to Egypt, but other records show that that was a cover for a straight trade relationship.\n\nLater on, from 1200-1600 A.D., the Malian Empire in West Africa was one of the richest in the world. When the ruler Mansa Musa made a pilgrimage to Mecca, he gave out so much gold to the poor along the way that he caused an economic crisis in Cairo, Egypt, and Medina, with hyperinflation virtually destroying their economies for a decade.

That's assets they manage, not the value of the company.\n\n(edit) Their market capitalization (the value of all of the shares of the company) is [131.8 billion GBP](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/HSBA:LN), or about $161 billion.
You can't tell because he edited his first post, but he said that Gm1m2/r^2 was wrong, and all you need is Fg=ma. \n\n(edit) and for more proof that he thought it was wrong:\n\n>If you're right, then calculate earth's gravity for me using the formula Gm1m2/r2.
Microprocessors were around before 1984 lol. People born in the 1970s grew up with video games and we even had online porn before 1984.
I was talking to people online on BBSes in 1980, and they'd been around for a while before that. Used to play a 1 turn per day version of Risk called Global War in 1982 or so.
Which did you miss the most?\n
We had those craptastic apple computers with the green squishy screens in school in 1981 or so. Learned to program a turtle to do tricks in LOGO, and it had already been around since 1967.
Yeah, the truck didn't right itself; the driver kept his head and probably saved a bunch of lives.
Energy can't be created or destroyed, but it can be converted to matter, and vice versa. Every second, our sun loses 4 million tons of mass that is converted to energy through fusion, and so do all the other stars undergoing fusion in the universe. Plus, as /u/BubblsAndSass mentioned, this formula works whether the mass changes or not.\n\nTL;DR: The mass of the universe actually is variable, and this guy is a tool.
There was a place near me when I was a kid called Mr Burger, and the logo looked just like this. I think it had been a Burger King that got repurposed. There's one of those near where I live now that was turned into a taco place and the playground has been Mexicanified. Anyway, my brother worked at Mr Burger when he was a teenager, and they were getting black market Kentucky Fried Chicken breading for their chicken somehow.

I was expecting a quiche punchline.
There is no force of gravity for a single mass. Gravity is always a force between 2 masses. The m2 mass is the mass of the person standing on the planet, or the mass of whatever thing you're trying to find the weight of. The reason we can estimate the gravitational pull of a very big thing like the earth and use a simplified formula like Fg=ma is that the differences between the various m2 masses (people, Volkswagons, cruise ships) are all very small compared to the m1 mass (the mass of the Earth.) You, my friend, are getting your very own /r/iamverysmart post!
There's nothing wrong with this. The guy wants to post stuff he wants people to see on his page, and doesn't want to argue about it. You can share the post to your own page and pick it apart there if you want.

It wasn't a miscommunication. Here's a [New York Times story](http://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/23/us/politics/23fox.html) written after the fact about it, and the NYT has no love for Fox News. It wasn't what Fox tried to represent it to be, but it wasn't innocent either.

10 million years to recover from the worst extinction event in Earth's history. Less extensive extinction events have recovered faster than that. People often refer to environmentalism as "saving the Earth" but what we're really trying to do is save ourselves. If we fail, the Earth will likely recover from the worst we can do to it pretty quickly and erase all but the tiniest traces of our once great civilization.
This guy is the first one to realize that it's always been wrong on every keyboard.

The Earth is the only place that we know life evolved, so our sample pool is a little low, but one conclusion we can draw is that it takes a relatively short time for life to evolve when the conditions allow it, and a relatively long time for large and complex life to first emerge. \n\nThe Earth formed about 4.5 billion years ago, and for the first few hundred million years it was a ball of molten rock undergoing constant cataclysms, including massive collisions (one with a body the size of Mars is theorized to have cracked the planet, breaking off the material that would form the moon) and conditions were constantly changing. It wasn't until about 4.1 billion years ago that the crust cooled and solidified and the oceans began to form. \n\nThe oldest life on Earth is debated, but life may have emerged by 3.8 billion years ago, and certainly was around 3.5 billion years ago, so somewhere between 300 million and 600 million years is the time it took for the first single celled life to appear. Multicellular life appeared not too long after, but organisms stayed pretty simple until the Cambrian Explosion, when all animal phyla except for one evolved, only about 541 million years ago, and intelligent life (the homo genus, our species is even younger) first appeared less than 3 million years ago. \n\nSo in the only example we know of life evolving, it took 300-600 million years to appear, around 3 billion years to get complex, and 3.5 billion years to develop intelligent life. That's around 4 billion years where you can't have an extinction event bad enough to wipe out every living thing, and a lot of places probably don't get that long. I'm as confident as I can be that we will find life on other worlds in our solar system, but I doubt we'll find any complex life.

First comment: "more socialism."\n\nWow, what a bunch of fucking retards.\n\nEDIT: Actually, on second thought, I'm all for it, because I want SJWs to further distance themselves from reality and show everyone how unpalatable their ideas are.
> This is a result of a crisis\n\nNo, this is a *response* to a crisis - and one formed by bureaucrats who decided that it was more important to come up with *any* solution rather than a *tenable* and *sustainable* one. \n\nAnd even with the percentage of them who had appreciable skills to begin with, I'm not convinced those skills will translate well to Western expectations. Some of my work includes travel to the Middle East, and *those* countries don't want Syrian technical employees - they won't work as cheap for entry-level stuff as Indians, and aren't good enough to take higher-tier technical positions that those countries typically fill with Americans, Brits, Germans, Aussies, or Kiwis. \n\nHow many generations is it going to take being *completely and totally dependent* on the government in these countries before they start producing populations that are net-positive taxpayers? What will the "soft costs" be - of increased crime and social stratification? There is a rational argument against taking refugees that has nothing to do with national security matters. 
If we're talking academia, we're *well past* this point.
Why "hopefully all of us?" 
>  You guys live in some fantasy world \n\nSays the fucktard advocating UBI. 
> In that Linux doesn't need anything from AMD to continue. AMD needs something from Linux.\n\nYeah, no.
You da man. Thanks for putting this out there.
I love a happy ending
Then it seems like the solution would be for states and local governments to raise that minimum - just like the normal minimum wage - as appropriate. \n\nThe feds are setting this as a baseline for H1-B entry into the USA, but that doesn't mean that a local government couldn't push it higher, right?
I'm not sure why anyone would listen to this twat. His two cents came out the day after election day saying "[markets may never fully recover](http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/projects/cp/opinion/election-night-2016/paul-krugman-the-economic-fallout)".\n\nMiss Cleo has more credibility than Paul Krugman.
Fuck off back to nowhere.
>  I mean I understand your interest, but people get hurt by these "cool techniques."\n\nWe are not debating the morality of malware, simply objective technical analysis - and if you lost an entire business to malware, perhaps you should try to focus a bit more on the technical instead of your own personal feelings.
> My favorite rule I have is any partners I have can only ask me to shave if they also shave. Either we'll both have baby smooth legs, or neither of us will.\n\nI wonder if Internet Rosie O'Donnell here also expects her partners to wear dresses if she does.
Yes, and our weapons of choice defeat rocks, pitchforks, and guillotines every time. \n\nSo please, liberals, bring your knives to a gun fight. You'll be sufficiently armed enough to warrant "justifiable homicide" but not enough to actually pose a threat.

> branch of secret government, with a black budget, and no oversight.\n\nWith all due respect, this isn't true - as popular as an idea as it seems. \n\nBoth HSCI and SSCI are bipartisan committees that have extensive oversight and budgetary approval for clandestine budgets. In addition, many operations require a direct executive signature. \n\nThe bottom line is that when individuals in Congress on these committees say they were unaware or if the president claims they weren't briefed, you're getting "fake news" - or their signatures approving these budgets and operations are being forged.\n\nThe reality is that classification is used as a tool to protect political careers - and that many high-ranking government political officials are "classification authorities." The president and members of congress can claim all day long they weren't briefed, and it would be illegal for the agencies they blame to tell their side of the story.
>  Thirty lashes and a stoning just to be sure\n\nNo need to stoop to their level, just send them back to their shitholes and don't take any refugees or asylum-seekers from those countries. 
Not the shrill idiot you're replying to, but I'd like to see a *lot* more nuclear. I want more research and development into clean and safe and long-lasting nuclear power.\n\nI went to a Tesla dealership recently and test-drove one of the sport sedans, and was distinctly left with the feeling that I was driving what the future of environmentally-sustainable personal automobile ownership was going to evolve into. It wasn't weak and pathetic like so many hybrids I've test-driven and owned, and frankly it blew them all out of the water in terms of energy efficiency. It really is a remarkable driving experience, but their *minimum recommended setup* is that you have a 50-amp 240v service to charge it, and they *prefer* 80-amp 240 if you can get it, which is really just nuts when you think about it.\n\nI just don't see wind and solar providing the necessary surge (or really even sustained) power supply to sustain that kind of home draw. You'd have a bunch of people commuting home and plugging all their cars in around the same time, and it would just cripple the grid, likely even as it stands today. Nuclear power can sustain *and* burst and isn't reliant on giant batteries to buffer you from things like an overcast or unwindy day - because seriously, the idea that the day-to-day weather should dictate whether there's enough supply on the grid **is a fucking retarded idea.** \n\nI want *real* ideas for *real* evolution in energy. Wind and solar might be nice supplements, but they're not an actual solution for what our energy requirements are going to be in the future. 
Why? That seems counterproductive. You're not the problem, they are.
> at least offer reasonable criticism.\n\nOkay.\n\nThe one time I visited AltRight is when [this post was linked there,](https://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:bMUCFBP1KUwJ:https://www.reddit.com/r/altright/comments/5ptasf/the_big_list_of_redditors_calling_for_violence/+&cd=2&hl=en&ct=clnk&gl=us) which details calls to violence from left-leaning subreddits. One of them was serious enough that the poster who made the threat was arrested.\n\nNone of those subreddits have been banned. \n\nI want to know why AltRight was banned for "doxxing" but users aplenty in politics are saying people [should be killed](http://imgur.com/a/t1uGE) and the communism and socialism subs are stickying posts encouraging violence in protests and the admins appear to not give a shit, even when it's apparently serious enough IRL that the poster gets arrested. /u/spez and the rest of them can fuck right off. I presented this same viewpoint in another sub and was downvoted and told that the leftist threats weren't "true threats" and then *yet another* protest by leftists results in protesters setting things on fire, beating people and pepper-spraying those wearing Trump hats, so don't fucking tell me that the calls for violent protests from the left on reddit aren't "real calls for violence." 
> I don't understand how someone can hold such contradictory attitudes.\n\nSimple: they're fucking retarded. 
This is why the media is attaching themselves to a "ZOMG RUSSIA CHANGED THE OUTCOME OF THE ELECTION" and pushing "fake news" without really vetting it. They sat around circlejerking that Hillary was going to win in a landslide and need something to quell the cognitive dissonance bouncing around their empty skulls on Inauguration Day.
Okay, so assuming Trump won't nominate Garland - which he shouldn't - then is the strategy to wait for four years?
Funny, I don't remember him being an advocate of taxing the personal computer for all the secretaries in the typist pool it'd replace. 
> Also they themselves got into trouble twice recently with famously republished "Muh Russia" stories which were proven to be complete lies.\n\nSource?
We deserved better than Obama irrespective of his race.
Considering the nature of nation-state cyber-espionage coupled with the abysmal security practices, I do not doubt that Russia was able to hack the DNC.\n\nI am doubtful of the following:\n\n- That WikiLeaks' source is Russian IO. It could just as easily be an insider who gave them the documents, or gave them Podesta's password since apparently most of the staffers knew it and WikiLeaks just copied everything out themselves. \n- That the e-mails resulted in the election going for Trump. I doubt the motivation of voters in Pennsylvania or Michigan or Wisconsin was primarily motivated by a bunch of weird shit the DNC did - rather, I suspect it was motivated by dissatisfaction of the job Obama did in relation to how the economy impacts them, and a (correct!) feeling that Clinton would be more of the same, or even worse. \n\nFor the record, I also have zero doubt that the Russian IO program obtained the contents of Hillary's private e-mail server that had classified information on it. 
>and are still working with groups like ctr.\n\nI think you mean ShariaBlue.
Honestly, I'm not sure it would behoove SpaceX to fully partner with NASA, because they'd lose massive amounts of agility and ingenuity and replace it with shitty government bureaucracy and even shittier management. 
Okay, so what's the strategy here then? Try to delay it for four years and hope for a win in 2020? 
"Kill them all" - try it, you safe-space-needing fucktards.
It's almost like your comment, except I left out the idiotic parts.\n\n>Keep trying, you'll be like me some day if you work hard\n\nI have no desire to be retarded like you.
It is called yellow journalism. 
> Abolish the CIA/NSA\n\nHonestly, that isn't the answer. The real answer is to first get politics and shitty government appointees out of these agencies as a first step.\n\nSecond, as most would tell you at the worker-bee level in these agencies, they fail upwards - meaning that instead of getting rid of an underperforming and shitty employee, they promote them into another department. It's easier than firing someone and gets rid of them quick. \n\nAt one time, America had the idea that intelligence services weren't needed, and that "gentlemen don't read each other's mail." That didn't work out well for us historically. The solution isn't to go back to that, but to depoliticize these agencies and drain their respective swamps of management that is utterly ineffective.
> Working in private industry there is much more PTO, larger salaries, and larger and more regular raises, and usually bonuses.\n\nFor technical people and those with skills, yes. \n\nThe government is great for harboring shitty managers, unskilled workers who have seniority via attrition, and people who plain suck at their jobs but don't rock the boat. \n\nI did a stint in government for a while. When I got fed up with the terrible management and politics and bailed to private sector, I immediately doubled my salary, plus had greater 401k contributions and time off. Extremely skilled technical experts are paid a pittance in government - but the admins who have been there for 30 years with a two-year generic degree were making more than most of my team with MS degrees in Computer Science but less than 5 years of job experience. Government service rewards loyalty and compliance, not expertise or performance. \n\nWhen people talk about "overpaid government employees", I think what they're *really* talking about are those managers who *might* last 6 months in private sector or the employees who'd never be hired in the first place in private sector - and there are a metric shit-ton. During the shut-down several years ago, my organization ran with a 15-20% staffing level but completed 80% of the work that they put out at normal staffing levels. *That's* what people are talking about.
Thanks!
I don't know about "warmongering fuckwits" - perhaps just poor students of history.\n\nWe armed and trained Osama bin Laden once upon a time, because certain people believe in the doctrine of "the enemy of my enemy is my friend." History has borne that out to not be the case in the grand scheme of things, but nobody who authorized Osama to get US-funded weapons is up for re-election, so those decisions have precious few repercussions for those in charge, but significant repercussions for our nation as a whole.

> It creates a more stable society\n\nNot in the US\n\n\n> less strife, \n\nNot in the US\n\n\n> and less competition for resources. \n\nProbably not at the level where it would be relevant to the US.\n\n> It also creates goodwill for the US and extends its soft power.\n\n[Okay.](http://imgur.com/LKwhDxB). \n\nIf people want to extend goodwill and believe in the mission of Planned Parenthood International, they can donate their own time and money to it instead of funding it with money that should either not be taken in the first place or used to directly fund federal mandates consistent with the Constitution. I'm frankly tired of hearing about why we need to spend millions of dollars on birth control for third world countries and how it's buying us all these intangible diplomatic and goodwill benefits that nobody can really identify but assure me is there. 
>  The letter also asks the incoming POTUS to brace for “accurate, fearless reporting”.\n\nSo in other words, now that Barack isn't POTUS, there will be no more coordinated Executive Salad Tossing by major media outlets, nor giving him a pass because he gives your leg a tingle.\n\n
I didn't realize I needed the answer to this question until I watched the video, but in retrospect realize my life was previously incomplete.

That's a very simplistic answer that indicates you have no idea what you're talking about.

...or we can just use the "nuclear option" that your own party instituted because Republicans now control the House and the Senate and the Executive, which incidentally seems like a pretty good indicator that voters don't want Garland as a nominee.\n\nAlso, Republicans didn't filibuster when Obama nominated his two shitty SCOTUS picks, so it seems like it's time for you guys to buck up and get on board for once.
While I appreciate your religious views, this makes more sense from a immigration and national security perspective - at least until we start seeing Copts or Chaldeans committing acts of terror in the USA.

>  They're watching, mostly in dismay.\n\nThat's okay.\n\n* When I see the insane levels of crime in South America, I watch in dismay.\n\n* When I see the massive taxation rates in other countries, I watch in dismay.\n\n* When I see the government attempting to control media reports of refugee violence "to avoid inciting hatred" I watch in dismay.\n\n* When I go anywhere in Africa - it's pretty much dismay from the point I get off the airplane.\n\nI frankly give exactly as many fucks - zero - as you do when *I* look at *your* country "in dismay." Instead of pretending like we should be one world with one government, how about we just respect that different countries want different things?

As someone who has run investigations across hospitals in the USA, I can tell you the threat is there.\n\nThe worst one I dealt with was from electronic dispensers within a chain of hospitals in 2016. Turns out they all ran on XP and none could be patched. It was running a 6 year old worm and launching attacks on other hospital systems. For me to remediate the issue, it required the hospital to basically pull all the drugs out and have dedicated nurses control the physical dispensary in every hospital unit with an impacted electronic dispenser. That required them to pull nurses from regular duty to babysit drugs because the system was down - and this was *the innocuous case.*\n\nImagine malicious code that directly targeted these machines! It would easily be able to tamper with the inventories reported inside of them.\n\nUnless the medical industry has a serious IT security overhaul, I see it as a matter of *when*, not *if.*

It will end with no VISA waivers for all EU nations, this is probably the only fair way to do it. It is not reasonable for the EU or the US to dictate visa requirements for each other. Ending all the agreements and starting over is the only fair outcome\n\nThe current agreements are bilateral between nations. If those nations no longer exist then the agreements do not. The US never agreed to accept any EU nation. They made agreements with the individual countries.

Plan b is just a high dose of birth control medication and its OTC. so interestingly enough the "overdose" is OTC but the normal use is prescription only. \n\nI can only surmise that money is involved. Maybe someone does not want to lose the 400 million income they get prescribing birth control.

> Losing elections? Republicans were on the brink of absolute disaster.\n\nIt is the Democrats who are on the brink, they bet hard on holding onto the presidency with HRC and capturing the Senate, In the hopes it would soften the impact of over 1000 state and federal level positions over the last 8 years.\n\nInstead, they lost the presidency failed in the Senate and increased the count to 1200.  Midterms look bad for dems defending 25 (12 safe)states to the Republican 8(6 safe). The 25 dems seats include 6 seats in states that flipped to Trump. \n\nThe democrats needed the 2016 national, not the Republicans. 
> Entire cases are granted and dismissed based purely on procedure.\n\nThat is not what happened here. And as for a debarment hearing that's absurd. Lawyers do not get disbarred for losing a case on constitutional grounds. We have an adversarial system, lawyers are supposed to advocate for the client even when they know them to be wrong. \n\nIf there are any grounds for disbarment here it would be for client abandonment and disparagement. This lady is no hero, she took  shit in her bed for political reasons. And she overturned her own departments approval of the EO to do it. 
This would not be a problem if you all carried the same passports. But since you do not you are not one nation.\n\n I think we understand if you want to all be treated the same, but that probably means requiring VISAs for all EU citizens as we have already determined that a number of EU participants do not qualify.
> but why is an artistic institution that has been intrinsically linked with politics almost since conception supposed to leave politics at the door?\n\nMaybe to keep from annoying a large percentage of its audience? Who wants to watch a bunch of actors complain about thier guy not winning an election. It is boring as shit no matter what side your on. \n\nI am not saying that they cant or shouldn't do it. I am saying it is going to hurt ratings. It is up to them if they care or not.   
You can put it into perspective though. I mean at the time that he gave that money it was to oppose gay marriage  Both the Obama administration and the Clinton organization were opposing gay marriage at the time. so its not like he was out of the mainstream or even in major disagreement with the political leadership of the time. 
He does not need to repeal anything. The president is specifically exempt from the conflict of interest laws passed by a democrat congress under Johnson. 
I still do not understand how states intend to stop paying taxes to the federal government? There is certainly no constitutional method to do so. They do not have the military power to enforce any extra constitutional method. \n\nAre you imagining just telling people to stop paying taxes and that any large amount would actually do so? Most taxes are paid by the top 10% of earners. Those people all have assets that can be taken, they are not going to go along, ever.
I agree, and if they do decide to end national sovereignty , they are going to have to renegotiate the existing agreements. 
Is that an opinion of yours. Do you have a citation to back that up as it is not what this study says. 
It is a question of geography. If until recently Canada and Mexico did not require passports so a border was not something most Americans would encounter without a 2 day drive or a 10 hour flight. \n\nJust driving across texas is the equivalent of going from Denmark To Rome
The white house would rather move forward then wait for the courts. This will make it to the court on the merits and be overturned just like when carter did it. 
Yes they are, they have all been negotiated bilaterally. The US never entered into a visa arrangement with the EU as they are not a sovereign nation that issues passports. The member countries issue them by their own standards with a EU name on them.\n\n You want to add new parties to the bilateral negotiations after the fact. 
I think Trump should fight as hard as he can to do the things he promised to do, he beat hillary but not doing the things the media and the left expected him to do, why would he start trying to be more like the person who he beat now that he won?

Who is fudging the issue? This is the first i have heard of conversion therapy in this conversation and as far as i know the issue was not supported by the foundation the owner ran. The only link I could find is that one of the over a dozen groups they donated to was in favor of it. But so was the Catholic church and I doubt the vast majority of people who donate to catholic charities are doing it so gay people can get a shrink to talk the gay away. \n\nI mean it is your bar, set it where you like, just don't get mad when others see it differently. \n\nhttp://www.snopes.com/hillary-clinton-marriage-is-always-between-a-man-and-a-woman/
Yeah, show me how a pipeline is worse for the environment then other ways of moving that oil from Canada to Texas. \n\nThey only way stopping these pipelines will help the environment is if they prevent that oil from ever being used. 
I think your mixing federal law with state. The state does not use the federal classification system. Confidential in this context is just private or personal. Governors are normally not part of the federal classification system. They do not get federal security clearances
I agree, the courts can change over time, but they usually do not change dramatically and they usually do not take powers from another branch. At most they will make some changes to the EO but there probably are not going to make 90% of it go away. \n\nIn that ruling the courts made it pretty clear they differed to the executive. \n\n“The present controversy involving Iranian students in the United States lies in the field of our country's foreign affairs and implicates matters over which the president has direct constitutional authority.”\n\nNot wholly irrational is a high legal standard.\n\n“Distinctions on the basis of nationality may be drawn in the immigration field by the Congress or the executive. So long as such distinctions are not wholly irrational, they must be sustained.”\n\n
No court has ruled on the merits of the case as no case has even been presented. We have had a procedural ruling only that found it fits the requirements for a TRO based on assertions and not evidence.\n\n 
Maybe when we had unlimited territories to fill but we have had periods of almost no immigration in the past. The 1930's for example saw a significant slowdown as we struggled to assimilate the early century immigration wave.
No one is saying that it is the be all and end all, but the markets have clearly seen Trumps election as a positive thing for equities. Why this gets downvotes or upvotes is more a question of agenda then facts. \n\nNo one can say what will happen in the future, but it is a fact that the financial markets have reacted positively. 
Yes, that is the idea. 
First, this was not an executive order by Obama it was just an opinion letter but more to the point the Trump administration has done tons of other things since becoming president.\n\n You may have had a point if this was something he did on day one, but it was done at the end of a month in office that included many sweeping changes and controversial decisions. If you do not like the order you are not going to like it any more in 4 months from now the timing on this was likely set by events, not as a message. 
The US does not and has never offered visa free travel for EU citizens. The US has bilaterally made agreements with individual nations that have joined the EU. If those countries want to cancel those agreements because we do not also have agreements with third party nations then I guess they can.\n\nI do not think we fundamentally disagree. The EU members who have VISA reciprocity agreements with the United States are free to cancel them. They probably do not actually need a reason. I just do not think that the US is morally or legally bound to offer VISA waivers to counties it does not have agreements with. 
Do you really think a measurable percentage of the country wishes millions of deaths on California?

Not suborning perjury is not the same as holding a pressor saying you feel your client does not deserve a defense. Your can hold this lady up as a political hero, but she is not a legal one. 
Some of the time is spent arguing with concern trolls and pearl clutchers. Trump fighting back against his opposition does not worry me, the lefts talk about taking trump out is my bigger concern. Trump calls a judge "so called" and we have people talking about overturning democracy and stolen presidency from the left. \n\nOf course he fights back, the left and the media are still in campaign mode. so is he.  
I do not understand why wealth is automatically considered a negative. Is bill gates a worse cabinet choice then a homeless guy? Would swapping him for a pauper make a cabinet work better?
While that had some effect it was more due to the immigration act of 1924 and its quota system. 
It would have been fine, and Trump still would have won.\n\nhttp://www.270towin.com/alternative-electoral-college-allocation-methods/
This is only about the ones who got caught committing crimes  but were released without being deported, A very small subset with a very high crime rate. The data is showing the effects of things like sanctuary cities. 
You mean he was sent to the concentration camp by the liberal hero FDR? I see..
The first time 99.9% of people heard about pepe being a symbol of hate groups was when the Clinton campaign orchestrated the accusation. It was manufactured for political reasons. The SLPC lacks credibility. 
\nFalse equivalency, both are allowed, you personally like one and not the other.
It is not even a law, it was just a letter giving the Obama administrations opinion that current law required transgendered people be covered under title 9's protections for gender.  It does not have the force of law behind it and should not because it was not meant to be part of that law and no court has found that it should be. \n\nObama was trying to expand the law without doing what is actually required and passing a specific law to address the issue or getting a judicial ruling.  He knew he could not actually pass the law so he pretty much just pretended he did. Reversing the letter was the correct legal course.\n\nThe executive branch under Obama repeatedly tried to expand its power to make laws when it could not get what it wanted through legislative action and the left supported it. That was bad but they let it go because he was their guy. But no matter what side of the issue you are on you should not want to do away with the checks and balances built into our system. \n\nThis issue belongs with the legislature and the courts regardless of Obama and Trumps posturing. \nedit: spelling
I think the dems are going to approve this guy if only under the implied threat of what comes after. \n\nIf the republicans feel that the Democrats are not going to accept anyone trump puts in and are put in the position of needing to follow Reids precedent they will not do it just to get some right of center jurist in. They will put in a dream appointment, someone reliable from the political sphere they can absolutely count on.  
The room also has huge windows and turning on the lights would be something the professional staff at the white house would be able to handle. I imagine they could put in new switches in an afternoon if it was wanted. 
After WW2 the Klan saw a huge resurgence. In the early 1950's public opinion turned against the Klan. The superman show had a 16 part series at the time that was very critical of the klan and is at least partially credited with putting an end to the klans public acceptability\n\nleaving the Klan during that period would have been a political necessity. I cannot tell you what was in Byrds heart at the time, but if he wanted to remain in politics leaving would have been the right decision.\n\n
10% of that would have bought you a really nice home in malibu in 1970. 
I am not "discounting" anything. The way the president is elected means it is bad to have your support centralized in one state. You need to be broadly popular to win. Even more importantly this dilutes your congressional support. \n\nThe idea of Representative democracy is to recognize each state has a voice in our democracy. Its not how many people who choose you. It is that a every state has its own say. You may not like it, but it is currently the only valid way to view the results as the changing of the rules would change the vote and campaign dynamics making predictions unproveable. 
Because Poland does not qualify for the VISA waiver program due to its high rate of VISA overstays. 
He has a residence at the resort, he does not rent rooms. Any rooms used by aids or SS is the business of the government and the cost paid by them. This is how it has worked in the past. Most presidents rent space at their homes for the government to use. 
It is pointing out the most discriminated group to give refugee status to, any minority region undergoing persecution is able to apply. But even then, this is one section and you notice a "as allowed by law" disclaimer. If its not allowed the rest continues. \n\nBut, that is not really the point. You want the entire 90 day delay stopped.

You cannot gerrymander the presidency. There are no districts to redraw. HRC's entire popular vote lead came from California. 
You can still be prosecuted for it under federal law if the feds cared enough to do so. Obama raided dispensaries and prosecuted drug cases in california. 
Well, you certainly have a right to say it. 
The EU is not a sovereignty. It is an organisation of sovereign nations that has a goal of being one nation at some future unnamed time. They do not do most of the things that nations do and are not represented by the EU in the united nations. 
You would be wrong. There are obvious outliers in this set. 
80% of ninth circuit cases reviewed are overturned. Most courts are closer to 60%
So, you would proactively depose a president over things he might do? \n\nWhom are you saying is trying to legitimize its opposition?\n\n
I am not sure what he is trying to say but it is obvious that your using statistics in a intentionally misleading way. Maybe it has something to do with that?
Why do you think he said it?\n\nHe just gave cover to the senate dems to vote for him and avoid the Reid rule being passed and an even more conservative justice being appointed. . 
This all rises to the level of "you don't like it" I do not expect you to, but its within the limits of what the constitution allows. But getting all wadded up over the semantics is BS. people see right through it.  
No, it was the plagiarism, that was the one thing, not this one thing but the other one. 
He opposed same sex marriage until the supreme court decided it was a right, pretty much the same stance as President Obama and HRC. \n\n Afterwards he stated  "now it will be interesting to see whether the victorious proponents of gay marriage will show tolerance toward those who disagreed with them when the issue was still in dispute."\n\nI have never seen anything about him being a bigot, do you have a source for that?
I think the US is more concerned about who issues your passport then what you consider yourself a citizen of. 
So your argument boils down to how can we enforce any laws if we are not going hard after music piracy?\n\nThat is a pretty stupid argument. Prosecutorial discretion is a good thing for a lot of very good reasons. As a society we have limited resources dedicated to prosecuting crimes. If we spent more resources tracking down music pirates we could not catch as many visa overstayers. Our community is allowed to prioritise. 
It is cherry picked data. It removes needed context and includes non relevant data in an attempt to distort the real answer to the implied question. Of course you already know this and are just trolling at this point. \n\nLiars love statistics because statistics never lie.
How much of that income is generated by companies doing business in the entire country but based in silicon valley? Google, microsoft and facebook are siding with the 330 million people with a congress and army.

You really do not need a complex philosophical explanation or a rundown on someones life to understand that a person who drugs and rapes a 13 year old girl is evil. 
Dems are going with the "bitch made me do it" argument. 
Maybe it is not something they would do on a daily basis. Maybe it would be something they do after then end of a fiscal year when profits are actually calculated.\n\nBut go ahead and pretend it is something he should do before the profit is actually calculated if it makes your outrage appear more reasonable. 
I guess you do not consider publicly stating your against gay marriage as working against gay rights, so I will give you that one. But the Clintons have had an organization for decades. however, I was specifically referring to DOMA that was signed by Bill and publicly supported by Hillary and Barak. 
The Obama administration was already working on this because of loss of highway funds. When diesel trucks begin to convert the entire interstate highway funding system will collapse, 
Responding to a improper firing by murdering an innocent unarmed girl perfectly fits the definition of insane. Actually calling him insane is a much nicer description the the reality which is he was a fucking evil psychopath. 
I never made any excuses for who I voted for. 
>  if a person acted to depose \n\nNope, never is this the decision of a person, the constitution is very clear on how to remove a president. Your just listing things a president might do, its not a legitimate argument for anything except the power of the strawman coupled with an opposition that feels morally justified in their anger. \n\nCome up with a vote to impeach and I will pay attention. In the mean time stop mistaking your opinion on what you want with the countries and stop building strawmen to burn.
I am pretty sure it is both, there are still huge amounts of political appointees left and many of the career people are political people. It is not like having a job makes your political opinions vanish. With the level of classified information coming out this has to be from the intelligence community. Very few people see NSA intercepts with the American identified. 
Are you arguing that what he did is not allowed, or that you do not like it?
The EO is not overreach, the TRO was. That order is completely within the bounds of executive power. The ACLU basically had to argue a falsehood that its religious discrimination to give a  a judge cover to overturn it. \n\nBut see, both of those are our opinions. The difference is I admit it, you just think you know. 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BiDiHX50zT4
The courts have not agreed with her at all. A TRO is in no way an agreement to one parties argument. There couldn't be more differences in the standards required for a TRO and a finding. 
The example was meant to be ridiculous and polarizing to point out the same aspect of criticizing a cabinet for having billionaires in it. Some billionaires are good cabinet members and some are not. It is the  same with less wealthy ones.\n\nThe idea that you can line people up by wealth and use that line as a measure of suitability for a cabinet position is ridiculous and polarising no matter what points you use on that scale. 
WTF are you even talking about, I do not want my children behaing like the president at all, its not their job. It would be weird to see executive orders frpom a 16 year old. They do not make the hard decisions that are going to piss people off. \n\nDismantling the democrats agenda is going to take time and i am sure he expects your vitriol, but your not liking it is not a valid reason for him to stop, its just another reason for you not to vote for him in 4 years. 
>There are minority Islamic sects\n\nYes, and they would have priority over the majority sect under the EO as it was written.
Not sure how that is working out with the Dems down 1200 seats during the Obama administration. Maybe they just do not vote the same way they register?
The left is not against the pipeline explicitly. What they want is more expensive gas. The problem is that is a very hard sell to the american people so they pretend its environmental damage from the pipeline. There is no chance that a politician who wants to get reelected is campaigning on doubling the price of your energy needs. \n\nBut it is a lie, they want oil prices to skyrocket. They are more then  willing to deceive people to get what they want. 
No president would do that right? It must be unprecedented to publicly shame a court for its decisions. Only a monster would do that, if this keeps up Trump might even call them out to thier faces, maybe in the state of the union speech when they have to be there and the most people are watching?\n\nMaybe, it is not unprecedented.  \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BiDiHX50zT4
Have you sourced yours?
The stock market strongly disagrees with your assessment. 
The entire nation is watching the media and the left throw childish hissy fits on a daily basis and trying to call trump names for defending himself. \n\nIt is like the media and the left do not understand that the average joe sees through their bullshit. People know whats going on, its why trump got elected. The most hysterical group or the most offended group is not necessarily  right. 
I expect the ICE to follow the EO and give priority to the most persecuted minorities to the extent allowed by law. 
How does he maintain he was framed when he has admitted to the rape, he just does not think that screwing 13 year olds is rape. Take this quote for instance.\n\n In 1979, Polanski gave a controversial interview with the novelist Martin Amis in which, discussing his conviction, he said **"If I had killed somebody, it wouldn’t have had so much appeal to the press, you see? But… fucking, you see, and the young girls. Judges want to fuck young girls. Juries want to fuck young girls. Everyone wants to fuck young girls!"**
I watched most of that debate! The kid from Sask crushed his few talking points. I was really proud of him. Not sure if he's lib or con, (I'm guessing lib given his stance), but either way he made good points.
There's only so much any of us can do. End of the day, we only have so much push within the US. It's largely up to you - but know that most of us have your back.
I still prefer Trumpettes.
While I can't vouche for that exact link, every indication points towards this tending towards the fascist side. I mean, shit, you can look at what Plato said and easilly see it reflected today.\n\nhttp://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2016/11/7/13512960/donald-trump-plato-democracy-tyranny-fascism-2016-elections\n\nAs this link does a decent job of describing. Note, this was from pre-election win.
So, while I'm waiting to clarify this with someone who actually does work with cows daily, I did some checking... and I think these are two fairly solid sources.\n\nhttps://albertamilk.com/ask-dairy-farmer/ive-started-buying-organic-milk-based-on-the-assum/\n\n>"If a dairy cow is being given antibiotics for an illness, she is temporarily removed from the milk producing herd and her milk is discarded. Once she has recovered and the antibiotics have cleared her system, her milk is again suitable for human consumption."\n\nI know this to be true based off of past conversations I've had with him.\n\nSeconded by this: https://bcdairy.ca/milk/articles/does-milk-contain-growth-hormones-and-antibiotics\n\n>"When cows are sick and require antibiotic treatment, the milk they produce is discarded for a regulated period of time to ensure the milk collected at the farm is antibiotic-free. Every truckload of milk is tested before being unloaded at the processing plant. If antibiotics are found, the entire load is discarded and the farmer who contaminated the load is heavily penalized. "
You realize you're pissing into the wind, right? They're never going to listen.
So... instead of actually continuing with the discussion when faced with the points I made... you retreat behind a meaningless quote totally unrelated to the post you reply to.\n\nSolid. Super solid. You're really helping to prove your point here.
I solidly respect many of your points. \n\n>Objectively they are two different forms of tyrannical, one is arguably worse than the other. I would choose neither given the chance, death if I were forced.\n\nThis however - this isn't about us. It's never been about you and I. It's about other people's rights to believe what they want (within the scope of our laws). So long as nobody's hurting anyone... everyone should be able to believe what they want.
Fair point! Great discussion, thank you.
But then you no longer have maxed out buffer.
It's even better when you stop to consider the fact that they were voting for him *because they couldn't trust Hilary.*\n\nHow funny is that shit? "I probably cant trust her, so I'm going to vote for this guy cuz he's probably lying anyhow". 
How... how much do you need? Read anything Trump has written. Listen to anything he says. He barely has a handle on our own language. But "he's got the best words" and is "very very smart" and has "a very good brain".\n\nIf a scientist used this language, they'd be laughed out of their field.
> politicians that are more receptive to lobbying than the demands of the people who voted for them\n\nAre... are you implying Trump is not receptive to lobbying? Or are you just stating that politicians and country leaders in general are prone to being influenced by lobby groups?
Personally speaking, I'm in the minority who has tried the reddit app and still prefers to use the desktop view on my phone. I'm sure there's not many like me, but we exist.
He doesn't.
You'll never know until you give it an honest to God shot. Thinking forward is the only answer here. There's a vacuum of jobs and something needs to fill it, but whatever does much more than likely won't be the jobs that left. 
I recently started to try and break my own echo-chamber that I've created. I'm liberal (mostly) and so are the majority of my friends... but I noticed in this last US election and with some upcoming changes to the Canadian Conservatives that I was missing a large chunk of the conversation. I've since gone out and subscribed to and started reading a lot more conservative articles and comments.\n\nI still don't agree with most of it, but I read and listen and it's absolutely helped to give me a better understanding of both sides.

I totally didn't catch the /s. :P Sorry. 
I totally get that. Points to you for replying to a snarky comment with a reasonable reply. That being the case, let me afford you the same respect you afforded me:\n\nYou're already the most protectionist nation in the world, and that method hasn't worked. It's not currently working, and I seriously doubt adding FURTHER protectionism is the answer.\n\nAt some point you need to realize that for all intents and purposes, those jobs? They're just gone. They're not coming back. Instead of pining for what was and trying to bring back a ship that's already sailed... why are you not investing in NEW jobs?\n\nYou have a chance to be a leader in solar and wind power - a field that would provide [more](https://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/US-Solar-Industry-Provides-More-Jobs-Than-Oil-and-Gas-Extraction) [jobs](http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/clean-energy-provides-more-jobs-than-oilsands-report-says-1.2857520) than some of the existing / traditional "breadwinners" like oil.\n\nWhy is nobody considering this? Why the hangup on old jobs that were moved to other countries? There are other paths available to you.
Trump? Talk about a white kid who was hugely pro-Trump going on a killing spree? Never going to happen. That would imply whites could be terrorists, and everyone knows only non-whites promote terror. </s>

So... what replaces those tax dollars? How the hell is he going to pull that off? Y'all have some wishful thinking going on here. He's not going to magic jobs back into existence. Mark my words.
That's not exactly accurate.\n\nSharia law is a interpretation of the laws within the Quaran. Even among Muslims, many follow practical laws very close to the western style. Sharia law has for a long time been at a family level. Now, that's recently sort of changed as groups who are heavily invested in it begin to try and push those beliefs on others (Exactly the same way ultra conservative Christians are trying to push anti abortion and similar garbage upon the US and Canada).\n\nSo, while you're sort of correct, you're also overwhelmingly generalizing the reality.\n\nMany many muslims (particularly here in Canada and in the US) overwhelmingly support the country's laws. They're not trying to subvert us, and they don't interpret the laws of the Quaran as the only real laws - The exact same way WE don't interpret the Ten Commandments as the only real laws. \n\nWe are more alike than we are different. 
Zweihander? Large 2h sword capable of making people face-plant?
I fucking hate Trump, but I fully support this. Just like I'm normally a Liberal (here in Canada) but am 100% against the Carbon Tax the libs are pushing through like a bunch of grandiose asshats.
Like much of the US Political process, it's directly drawn from a completely different time, which makes it feel awkward to all of us. This is the nature of most governments however.

It is a convenient fuck up for exactly the reasons I specified before. She fucked up 3 times. That's not strategy.\n\nBut hey, let's argue for a second that it is. Let's say she was fully apprised of the situation and that she didn't fuck up. What you're saying is she *purposely* decides to call a failed terror plot a massacre.\n\nHow is that not the very same "fake news" you're all yelling about all the time?\n\nIf CNN was to call a violent protest a "peaceful movement" to "draw attention to the issue" - that would be fake news. But you take that situation and apply it to what she said, and it's not?\n\nDo you not see how this is hypocrisy? \n\nEdit: Additionally, the same person fucking up three times is not in any way an indication of strategy. Now, if three independent people within the same party ALL said the same thing - that's fucking strategy.
Haha, exactly. ;)\n\nIt's almost like moderately religious people take their texts with a grain of salt, knowing that the world has evolved in the ~2000 years since those texts were written.

Sooner or later he'll have nobody left to throw themselves on the sword for him, if he keeps chewing through them at this rate.
Honest question - why do we need to resist Islam?\n\nI get resisting Shariah (sp?) law, but normal run of the mill standard Islam? Why? They're just practicing their beliefs, and most of them are pretty nice people when you sit down and talk to em.\n\nNow, don't get me wrong - I'm not going to sit by and watch a law get passed that stops any criticism of Islam - I believe I should be able to criticize everyone (from Islam to Christanity to... well, you). But nothing is being hurt simply by allowing them to live their lives and practice their religion.
Did you use the Paintbrush to make it purple, or is that it's natural colour? You could likely find green slime underground on some planets that would be similar to this once painted.

Paint with a big enough brush and everything is true. That's why generalizations are shit. This is not a generalization.
"I can't follow the reasoning they use, so I hate philosophers".\n\nFTFY.
Ahhh okay! Makes sense!
In all seriousness - as your closest neighbor, y'all gotta get your shit under control. If the US implodes into a civil war, it's gonna be fuckin bad for all of us. (And this looks more likely every day).
I mean, that's kind of accurate. We're not a dominant force of military, but woe to the idiot who pisses off Canada enough to get us to actually fight.\n\nWe played that game with you guys once, and we burned your pink house to the ground. Now it's white. ;) 
I get that you're joking, but if we've learned anything well in Canada it's that segregation isn't the answer. These people think this way because they've never actually met a muslim.\n\nIt's a lot harder to hate an entire race / religion / ideology when you've interacted with a number of them and learn that they are - like all of us - just humans. Flawed, weird, beautiful humans. Like everyone else.
Hey, regardless what the others say - good on ya for catching it and having the humor to mention it. Have a great Friday. :)

While this would be so super awesome... at this point, I just don't think we could pick up where we left off.\n\nAt the very best, I think we'd have to be following a NEW crew, on new adventures. With tons of cameos from the original cast as they sort of "pass on the knowledge" that they gained through Firefly / Serenity and whatever happens in the intervening years.\n\nThat, to my mind, is the only way a Firefly sequel could work. It has to be a spinoff.\n\nI just... I can't go back if there's no Book. Shepherd was an integral part of the team, and it would be a disservice to launch this now, so shortly after his passing.
More likely: totally uninformed.\n\nWe live in a time where there is magic in our pockets. You can look up anything your mind could possibly question (to the point where 16 year olds are playing with nuclear fission in their garages), and yet nobody fucking uses it to do anything besides confirm their own biases. We live in echo chambers of our own making, and it's going to fucking wreck us. 
Don't hold your breath. The type of people who would get conned in this way aren't exactly the type who could trouble-shoot their way out of a wet paper bag.

A lot of you are posting the transcript from Obama, but... I missed Trump's inauguration, since I was at work. Would one of you be so kind as to post BOTH what Obama said and what Trump said?
But isn't that true of most religions? Christianity has the same issues of pushing for Christian communities and Christian values. That doesn't mean that every Christian-centric country is going to suddenly decide that the Ten Commandments are suddenly above the laws of the land.\n\nMy point here is that while all religions desire expansion the practitioners recognize that the laws of the country supersede those of their religious texts. The vast majority of muslims are no different.\n\nRadicals of ALL faiths cause problems. Radical Islam gives us folks who push for Sharia law and other horrendous shit. Radical Christianity gives us anti-abortion / anti women's right to choice shit, and other horrendous shit.\n\nWe're really not so different. 
haha I hope so :P I'll be starting to check this out tonight! I'm pretty pumped to see what it's like, given the replies here. Seems like I've been missing out!\n\n(Much like I was with the Welcome to Night Vale podcast until recently!)
The White House has no direct connection to these "disappearing sources" you keep taking about. Ignore the black bag being carried by the two men to my left - that's just a left-over Christmas tree.
Ah yes! Now that you've noted his name that's absolutely the guy I was thinking of. I was so impressed that it sounded like the entire room was behind him when he was speaking. This issue at least has absolutely brought both conservatives and liberals together in a common outrage. Super nice to see.
He's really not. You lot seem to think he is some kind of long-playing genius... but he's a fucking moron, and that's clear to anyone with any inkling of critical thinking.\n\nTrump isn't a smart man. He will never be a smart man.
From the point of view of someone outside of the US, it's pretty clear how you got here.\n\nFor years now it's been going this way. Education inequity combined with an over-abundance of noise and trivial bullshit has brought the US right where it is today.\n\nMuddy the education waters, and then fill the conversation with non-news, fake news, and stupid bullshit (such as the US's fixation on celebrities) so that everyone is either misinformed or uninterested, while creating a very real right/left rift largely on purpose and... boom. Here we are.
All of Canada tosses it's head back and laughs.\n\nHasn't destroyed us yet.
hahaha, fuck that.
Everyone has somewhere they could improve. We absolutely are (in general terms) fairly racist towards natives. I've been guilty of it myself. That said, it's something I think we're slowly getting better at. Or at least, I hope we are. I try to be. The people around me appear to also try to be. 
Anticipating that they're going to play the "whistleblowers are dissenters" card, without understanding the difference.
Okay... sure. Let's entertain that notion for a second. Repeal will leave tens of millions of people out of coverage... what about them? Healthy people contribute to the country. It's in everyone's best interest that the public is healthy.\n\nIgnoring that however,  Trump himself wants to replace aca, not just get rid of it. Replacement = COST. So where does that money come from? \n\nHow does any of this help promote jobs? How does it help pull the average American up? Who REALLY benefits from this plan? Do you? Are you going to see money in your pocket? Are your premiums going to go down?? Of course they're not. That's not how the game works.\n\nTrump repealing ACA isn't going to help anyone. Not you, and sure as shit not those losing it.
No and no.\n\nThe money being spent is still being spent on foreign aid. It's just not going to the same places - but it's not going back to the American economy.\n\nAnd no, they're not "paying for their own". The rest of the world is stepping up to take your place. There's a bit of a difference there.\n\nAs to whether that's a good thing or not... that's pretty much dependent on how you view it. In the long run, it changes very little besides making the US look less like the world leader that it used to be. Fun fact: part of the reason the US was great to begin with was because of how the rest of the world viewed you as a haven of freedom and prosperity. You're trading this for minor short-term gains (or in this case, no real gains at all).\n\nIn the long run, we'll see how this works out for you... but I don't expect it to work out favorably.
Would it change your stance if the money being provided was done through a charity instead of a tax? Do you even donate to charities? (Actual question, I'm just wondering where you draw the line)
> Go to heavily urban areas where you don't need a driver's license.\n\nYou need an ID to:\n\n* Get a job\n* Rent an apartment\n* Drive a car\n* Cash or deposit a check (including government benefits and your tax return)\n* Enter most government buildings (including the Dept. of Justice, which under the last administration opposed voter ID)\n\nWho are the supposed people who have never had a need to do any of these things?
No. \n\n*sweats profusely*
I mean... I guess the overall plan is working then if they're unable or unwilling to see what is so blatantly obvious to outsiders like me.\n\nThat said, this isn't an original idea. Where others are drawing parallels to 1984, I think we're seeing something a lot closer to "A Brave New World". \n\n>Social critic Neil Postman contrasted the worlds of Nineteen Eighty-Four and Brave New World in the foreword of his 1985 book Amusing Ourselves to Death. He writes:\n\n>What Orwell feared were those who would ban books. What Huxley feared was that there would be no reason to ban a book, for there would be no one who wanted to read one. Orwell feared those who would deprive us of information. Huxley feared those who would give us so much that we would be reduced to passivity and egotism. Orwell feared that the truth would be concealed from us. Huxley feared the truth would be drowned in a sea of irrelevance. Orwell feared we would become a captive culture. Huxley feared we would become a trivial culture, preoccupied with some equivalent of the feelies, the orgy porgy, and the centrifugal bumblepuppy. As Huxley remarked in Brave New World Revisited, the civil libertarians and rationalists who are ever on the alert to oppose tyranny "failed to take into account man's almost infinite appetite for distractions." In 1984, Orwell added, people are controlled by inflicting pain. In Brave New World, they are controlled by inflicting pleasure. In short, Orwell feared that our fear will ruin us. Huxley feared that our desire will ruin us.\n
>As the countries leader everything he says is speaking like a leader\n\nNo. See, this is why language is important. What he says is issued from the state of leadership. He is the leader of the country, and what he says is said from a position of leadership. That is *not the same* as being said in a Presidential tone.\n\nLook at and compare Trump to any past president you'd like. Even the worst of them had an air of leadership when speaking. They spoke like leaders.\n\nThis isn't hard to understand.
Yeah... I think a number of us are guilty of this. I'm proudly Canadian, and lately my twitter, facebook, and reddit is largely dominated by Trump shenanigans. 
That's *not* smart though! It's a convenient fuck up at best.\n\nYou can't just misrepresent the facts and then say "it's all good that I did this because now everyone is talking about it".\n\nThat's a *very* dangerous slope to stand on. It's *exactly* the type of fake news that Trumpers love to rant about. What she did was a blatant misrepresentation of the facts of the issue, and she absolutely should be held accountable for that. If you don't admit that this is wrong, it gives free reign for any shitty half-assed news organization or politician to say just about whatever the hell they want because "in the end it brought focus to the issue".\n\nFuck that. We need to dramatically improve factual and unbaised reporting. So many articles on both sides of this argument are barely vetted, poorly sourced, and stupid-easy to rip apart.\n\nYou can't bitch about fake news while supporting fake news. It's either all or nothing. It shouldn't matter what party promotes it, or how it plays out in the long run.\n\nNow, as to Bernie - I completely agree. That absolutely should have gotten more attention. It is - so far - the only thing Trump has done that I fully support. I was against the TPP when it was being discussed a year ago, and I still am. Good on him for shutting it down.
You think too highly of the current President if you thought he anticipated this turn of events. This is just a happy accident, since the rest of the world isn't a bunch of douche canoes.
I'm being childish for demanding that the *leader of one of the most powerful countries today* speaks like a leader? \n\nI'm being childish for assuming that the general populace doesn't need to have everything dumbed-down for them?\n\nSeriously? That's really the hill you're going to stand on? 
But that's the typical double standard.\n\nEveryone loses their shit the second Michelle suggests getting them to eat healthy... but nobody bats a god-damned eye when they promote DeVos to a position that could **quite literally** fucking destroy the public school system.\n\nIt's like half (or more) of your country is actively working *against* the future generations, while happily patting themselves on the back for "saving" the children.\n\nIt's a goddamned madhouse down there.
If your general populous is so uneducated that you need to devolve the language you use to address them to that which you'd use on a child... it shows a dramatic need for some serious education in the country. \n\nWe're adults. We should be able to comprehend language above that used on school-age children.\n\nOr, are you saying that you need everything dumbed down for you? That the general public isn't smart enough to "get it" if you don't?\n\nIf that's your stance... you might want to consider what that implies about the average Trump supporter.
There's an adage about a snake my folks used to tell me when I got myself into a jam of my own making, and it sort of reminds me of this way of thinking.\n\n>A man was walking along one day when he came across an injured snake. The snake says "Please help me, I'm wounded". The man replies "But you're a snake, you'll bite me". The snake says, "No, I won't. I promise if you help me, nurse me back to health, I will not bite you." So the man thinks about it and agress to help the snake anyway. He spends his time and cares for the snake. Once the snake was healed, the man reached down and the snake bit him. The man says "You bit me". The snake then says, "What did you expect, I'm a snake".

Ah, that's sad. I admit that I hadn't bothered to click through to see anything more about them. I gave them the benefit of doubt.\n\nBut hey, that's okay too. It's not my place to change their mind; I'm simply here to point in a different direction. It's up to them to take the next step in understanding. They're only speaking their mind, which we're lucky enough to be able to do freely. 
Of course - nor will he or she reply. They likely realize the hypocrisy of what they're saying, but are too proud to step off the hill they've chosen to make their stand on.
News reliability shouldn't be a party-specific issue. There's a post on one of these subs talking about how Trump is essentially conned into doing things by saying "obama wouldn't have the stones for this".\n\nNobody seems to care that the line is totally un-sourced and that nothing in the rest of the article backs up the statement... but I care. I fucking hate Trump, but I'm not blind to liberal media pulling stupid shit just because it's going to garner a ton of attention. That article is misleading and totally non-news.\n\nWe should all care about this shit. It doesn't matter who's doing it, or what agenda is being pushed. EVERYONE should be held accountable, and should be pushed to a higher standard.
He also said Mexico will pay for this wall and that his inauguration was the most watched and the most attended ever, so....
Now, I can't comment on how common-place or acceptable paedophelia is in Islamic countries - I've never really looked into it closely, so I won't make any assumptions there. It may well be that that's the case... but I'm not sure that paedophelia has a direct link to Islam. Is the number of cases in Islamic countries higher than those of warlord ruled Africa? Is it a cause of religion, or is it a cause of lack of education? (These are largely hypothetical questions, but it's worth bearing in mind. There may be other factors at play here than simply being Muslim).\n\nThat said, Extreme vetting *is* in place, and our laws are applied equally to all Canadians - both new Canadians and those of us who were born here. It's not easy to come to Canada. Nor should it be. We should be sure that we're not simply throwing the doors open. It's important to be sure that those we're letting in are coming here because they want to integrate with Canadian society and be members of our communities.\n\nAnd, as I've said in other comments - the vast majority of Muslims in Canada have *absolutely no interest in attacking women or children*. They're not here to rape people. They're not here to fuck around with little kids. They're here to live their life peacefully, in a prosperous and welcoming country. They're here to give their kids a better future.\n\nThe vast majority of Muslims are just like you and I. They have different prayers and fashions but they're not evil, or hateful, or stupid and backwards. They're just people. They deserve the same respect and kindness that you and I deserve. 
So... just to clear this up. You're saying that to *help* the economy, first you're going to *hurt* the economy, and then somehow, you'll get more jobs and everything is going to be better?\n\nThat's really the line you're going with?
I and many others have said this literally since the moment he spouted this shit in his campaign. Of course Mexico isn't paying. The Taxpayer will for sure though. I feel bad for those of you who will suffer for this who didn't vote for him. Those of you who did: this is exactly the kind of business bullshit you voted in and I hope you pay out the ass for it.
The sad thing about politics is everyone's being duped. Nobody really wins. The rich stay rich, everyone else stays poor, and slowly we erode everything else until the masses get so pissed off that we chop off a bunch of heads and do a hard reset. But humanity is too stupid to see the cycle, and so inevitably we do it again. And again. And again.
The ending of 1984. Meaningful, and poignant, but infuriating.
He also is "totally brilliant" but can't spell Honor, so... there's that.\n\nFuckin idiot spelled it "Honer" as in: I'm honered to be your President.\n\n...and yet people still argue with me and say he's super intelligent, when really all he is, is lucky and rich. He's a goddamn moron.
OH! Yes, these are both Canadian sources (I am Canadian). Policies in the US are (from what I've heard) VASTLY different than here in Canada. We've got a lot of safety and regulation in place in dairy and beef production.\n\nSadly, I'm not really sure how different / safe US milk is. \n\nSorry!
They're better at certain things than me - no doubt there. Smarter though? I very much doubt that.
That's the same reasoning a lot of people used to justify voting for him to "fix" the problem of lobbyists buying politicians. It's like they didn't even consider the fact that all they did was remove the middle-man.\n\nThis dude isn't going to fix money in politics. HE IS MONEY IN POLITICS. \n\nSo much about this is utterly mind-boggling. People looked into their luggage, saw a box of Common Sense and went and tossed it in the garbage.

How long until you cede and join Canada? (We have cookies, healthcare, AND gay rights - but it's mostly the cookies we'll bribe you with).
And that's totally cool! You should be prepared to defend your beliefs. I'm simply pointing out that it's a disservice to everyone to assume you don't have allies within every religion.

If only Harper had dumped buckets of money into our defense budget... lol\n\nWell, if it comes to that, I'm sure it'll be a group effort that steps up. We're already ramping up our defense spending, but it's nothing compared to the US. You guys have all the fun toys...
Saskatchewan checking in. I've seen a few MAGA's, but they're drowned out by-and-large with the rest of us who are anti-Trump. They're still here, and probably more than in BC or TO, but less than a person might expect from the prairies. 
It's worth noting that our morality is not the morality of any of the bibles. Not the Christian Bible, and not the Quaran.\n\nAt the time these two texts were written, being married at 13 was not uncommon in any way, shape, or form.\n\nNow, I'm not saying that this excuses anyone TODAY who believes this shit is okay - but most muslims I've actually talked to take it with a grain of salt - the same way most Christians do with their Bible.\n\nNone of these relics of the past are clean. They all have rotten shit in them, and they're all a little backwards. That's what happens when you don't change the core text of a document for hundreds of years.
Join us again next week for the exciting conclusion to 'Fifty Shades of Policy'!
She was, and is, also an idiot.\n\nHow the fuck do you mistake a foiled plot with a defacto massacre? Three fucking times no less.\n\nI'm not underestimating anyone. They are fucking idiots, who convince other fucking idiots that they have some kind of handle on what the fuck they're doing. None of them do, and none of you are critical enough to call bullshit on them, even when it's blatantly obvious.\n\nStop putting these people on a pedestal and actually think about what they're doing, and what they're saying. Ask yourself if this behavior would be acceptable in any other situation, instead of just sucking the dick of your preferred party.
Every country has problems. I agree that the disaster in Flint is horrendous, but I don't think you understand what this article is saying. The funding isn't going back to the economy. It's still being spent on foreign aid. That hasn't changed. It's just going to different places.\n\nThere's no reason that you can't worry about the world and worry about home. These are not mutually exclusive. 
I'm all for hating Trump, but how in the sake of fuck is this news?
I could be wrong here (and I'll certainly ask my father-in-law when I have a chance) but I'm pretty sure that by the time milk (or beef in general) reaches you, there is absolutely no hormone left in the product. Antibiotics as well. You can't even sell a cow who's had any antibiotics until they're long clear of it's system. \n\nCanadians who directly deal with the industry: feel free to correct me if I'm wrong here. As I said, I'll clarify when I have a chance.
Ah! So you did. Clearly, I didn't read that well enough. Or perhaps misunderstood the intent. Either way. Oh well. \n\n"This is Sanguine's spleen..."
>"Westernized" muslims go against the world majority\n\nDo they? Do they really, or is that the view of the world we see in the West? \n\nIt's easy for me to point at the fact that ISIS (or ISIL or whatever it is those shit-heads call themselves now) kill more fellow Muslims than they do westerners for being "un-Islamic". So if that's true, then those Muslims must be more "westernized" than the radicals rushing to ISIS, right? And it seems like the vast majority of the people in the areas that ISIS is stomping over just are trying to survive. They're not flocking to the banner, they're just keeping their heads low living their lives.\n\nWhich begs the question: is that statement that moderate reasonable muslims are a minority accurate?\n\nIf so, why the huge disparity within their own region? Why do the vast majority of Muslims who come here have very little real trouble integrating and are more than happy to become fellow hard-working and proud Canadians? \n\nThey've got to be coming from somewhere, and I can't believe that these people are the minority.\n\nI fully admit I could be wrong here... but it's just hard for me to NOT give them the benefit of the doubt. 
It's hard to tell how seriously to take this without details. A drone could be a quad-copter you can buy on Amazon for $100 or a serious military piece of equipment that can carry weapons.
Uber drivers are not employees. Uber is a fantastic example of capitalism at work (surge prices encourage drivers to drive at unpopular times, workers can choose to work or take days off at will, and job retention is a function of measurable performance). If Uber is forced to treat its drivers as employees, they might take the upside of that as well (for example, forcing schedules and routes on drivers like real workplaces do or limiting hours to avoid having to pay overtime).\n\nLabor should be a free market. If you want to work freelance, you can set your own hours with a job like Uber. If you prefer more structure and a set wage, jobs like that are available too. Like all markets, government interference with labor just increases inefficiency.\n\n> I think tech workers in particular are in a much better position to form a union in a way you envision: forget anything regarding seniority or set raises/promotions, but instead fight for better benefits and focus on better work/life balance (queue all the Amazon folks working 70+ hour weeks).\n\nAs a non-union software engineer working for great pay and benefits and with a fantastic work/life balance, I disagree. Anyone working 70 hours at Amazon is doing so for the technical challenge, not because they have to. There is such a shortage of engineers and salaries are so high that no one at any top tier company is stuck there.
I actually thought this was on r/Israel when I first saw this. The commentators also said after she failed to serve due to laughter that it wasn't nice and she shouldn't be doing it.
An asshole like that is almost certainly driving again, despite the ban. Catch him and report him. 
Name calling will get you nowhere. I haven't said anything positive or negative about Syrians (unless you consider being called an Arab to be an insult, which would be your problem).\n\nUnless you can provide a reliable source that says otherwise, the vast majority of Syrians are Arabs.

Is that really true? The [Hearthstone Wiki](http://hearthstone.gamepedia.com/Resurrection_effect) explicitly says otherwise:\n\n> As per the game's usual rules, **only minions that die while in the battlefield** are considered to have 'died'. Minions that were transformed, discarded from the hand, **overdrawn**, or removed from the deck or other zones are not considered to have died, and so will not be summoned.\n\nHowever, the [Advanced Rulebook](http://hearthstone.gamepedia.com/Advanced_rulebook) on the same site says that overdrawn cards are placed in the Graveyard, which I assume would make them eligible for resummon. Has anyone actually tried this?\n\n**EDIT**: looks like this is addressed above but the original comment was downvoted. These minions used to be resummoned but aren't anymore.
Solar is never enough by itself, because even in the best case it's dark half the time. What solar needs is a massive improvement in energy storage, otherwise it can only ever be supplemental.\n\nThe best energy source, both in terms of cost and environmental impact, is nuclear (yes, even if you count past disasters), but unfortunately the left is irrationally scared of it.

>For some reason, when people talk about scientists who disagree with global warming they point to scientists from other disciplines that don't believe in man made global warming. Well, I am sure they are smart people, but I know tons of scientists. Those fuckers think they know everything about everything, but really they only know a lot of things about a small subset of things.\n\nThe often-cited 97% number includes scientists and papers in other fields. For example, a biology paper about the effect of increasing temperatures on frogs would count as endorsing the consensus.\n\n> Just like every physicist accepts that gravity exists and can be decently well modeled by our current theories, just about every climate scientist accepts that the world is getting warmer.\n\nThe question isn't whether the world is getting warmer, but why. The evidence there is on far shakier ground. For example, there was a [survey](https://gmuchss.az1.qualtrics.com/CP/File.php?F=F_cRR9lW0HjZaiVV3) published last year by the American Meteorological Society. While 96% of AMS members agreed that the world is getting warmer, only 67% agreed that the warming was largely or mostly due to human activity. That's far from universal agreement.\n\n>On the flip side, its crucial that we as a society can make policy without consensus. \n\nAnd now you're getting to the root of it. The question of whether the Earth is warming, or why, is academic. The real question is: what policy changes (emissions caps, for example), if any, should be implemented. Answering this question requires understanding the effects of these proposals. For example, spending [tens of trillions](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-01-29/paris-climate-deal-seen-costing-12-1-trillion-over-25-years) of dollars to slow the temperature rise by [a few years](http://www.nationalreview.com/article/428485/paris-climate-agreement-just-say-no), as Paris does, may not satisfy a cost/benefit analysis, when that money could be spent on mitigation instead.

"Big portion"? Did you see the [org chart](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/C3H0xvSXgAAwbWn.jpg:large) shown in the article? The ones outlined in red are the people we're talking about. 1 out of over 20 people who report directly to the secretary, and 3 one level below that out of 30 at that level shown on the chart (and probably many more than that). Reporting that as the "entire senior level" of the department is fake news by itself, regardless of being fired vs. quitting.

I'm happy to see a source on this if things have changed, but if not these countries have much more to answer for than the US does. \n\nI'd much rather the US give money to help them resettle elsewhere in the Middle East where they're a better fit culturally, rather than take in a bunch of people that are essentially impossible to properly vet.
> What should be troubling all of use the most is why 30 million women came out on election day to deny a woman the Presidency.\n\nThe suggestion that, for example, a wealthy pro-life woman should vote for Clinton because of her gender is troubling. The millions of women (including an overall majority of white women) that voted for Trump did not do so to "deny a woman the Presidency". They voted as most people do: in specific support of one candidate and/or opposition to the other.\n\nAssuming that everyone votes by demographic bloc or according to specific labels is naive, and is part of the attitude that caused the Clinton campaign to so badly misallocate its resources and likely cost them the election ([further reading](http://www.politico.com/story/2016/12/michigan-hillary-clinton-trump-232547)).

> But put another way: why should you get the same benefits that union members collectively bargained for when you aren't part of the union? That is the situation for many that opt to not join a union as an agency fee payer or objector in unionized workplaces.\n\nIf unions are such a good deal, why do they need government laws to protect them? If people can't bargain for themselves anyway, why make it effectively illegal for them to even try?\n\nIn my ideal world, employees at union shops would be able to freely choose whether they want to join a union or not. The employer might offer two packages: the union salary is $X, you'll pay $Y in dues and be on a fixed seniority pay-scale with these benefits. Or, I'll hire you as a non-union employee for $Z. Your promotion scale is determined by your performance instead of seniority, but I can also fire you much more easily, your pension is different, etc. \n\nThe idea that 51% of employees at a given workplace at one point in time can make a choice that impacts the other 49% (positively in some ways, negatively in others) seems completely unfair, as neither the minority nor the employer want to enter the contract that's being forced on them.

It's better to play first, because a player who goes first can lose their first game and still win while the player who spectates first must win twice in a row.

Some players are even able to win 70-80% of games at high legend. The idea that someone thrashing at rank 5 is anywhere near the skillcap is ridiculous.\n\nThe rank 5 players you're talking about may be playing similarly to each other, but that doesn't mean they're playing at the highest possible level.
What?
Tell me more. Can you point to any specific attacks in Israel committed by ISIS? \n\nThe rate of attacks in Israel is down significantly in the last few years, due to the wall among other factors.
It's fine to complain about the meta, but the idea that you can't play decks other than shaman or pirate warrior competitively, or that there's no room for innovation, just isn't true. On Twitch right now, you can watch:\n\n* DisguisedToast playing Combo Djinni Priest\n* Savjz playing Reno Burgle Rogue\n* Sjow playing Reno Mage\n* Trump playing Control Warrior\n\nJade Shaman, Renolock, and Dragon or Reno Priest are also varied decks that you can play competitively. There is an important difference between one deck being best and one deck being the only one that can be streamed or played competitively, and the latter just isn't true.
Not that the presidency is a popularity contest, but "historically unpopular" President Trump has a Gallup approval rating of [45%](http://www.usnews.com/news/national-news/articles/2017-01-23/gallup-donald-trump-starting-with-even-approval-rating), nearly the same as Obama's average.
Since you like museums, I recommend the Palmach museum in Tel Aviv. It tells the story of the war of independence through filmed reenactments; the acting is a bit cheesy but the story is fascinating.\n\nYou can also hop on a train north and check out Haifa, which you could easily spend a full day at. Haifa is more accessible on Saturday than a lot of the rest of the country (buses running, for example).\n\nCaesarea, which someone else mentioned, is also reachable by train and is very cool to see, but would only keep you busy for a few hours.

As far as I know, the US census does not publish data that includes immigration status. This map presumably includes naturalized US Citizens and green card holders, who are not currently affected by this order. It's plausible that a significant majority of the people shown fall into these categories. 
>"Below is a list of 78 major terrorist attacks targeting the West that were **executed or inspired by ISIS** since September 2014, soon after the terror group declared its caliphate. Most of these attacks did not receive adequate attention from Western media sources," a White House official said on background, when distributing the list.\n\nHas ISIS committed any attacks in Israel that I missed?
> > I've never seen odds multiplied together like that before, though it makes sense that you can do it. The math is the same either way, I think, but I find probabilities easier to reason about. To each their own!
Cool ending, [though I would complain that the green circle makes it much harder to see what isn't crossed, and also that H. Ramis seems to be in random order.](/sp)
A quick scan of the [Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Instant_Criminal_Background_Check_System) suggests that, if you're name is not on the list, you get approved right away. If you are on the list (in this case, put there by SSA), you're denied instantly and the FBI has 3 business days to make a final decision about the purchase. So basically, you've potentially taken away the right to purchase and now a government agent gets to decide.\n\nI'm not sure how often these decisions are overruled by the FBI in practice, but the denial of one's constitutional rights should not be taken lightly or without due process.
Yes they did, it's simple math. If you go back a few dozen generations, there weren't enough people on Earth for every branch of your family tree to be unique. \n\nPeople in your family tree, and maybe even you and your significant other, are unknowingly 5th or 6th cousins or whatever. That means that somewhere up the line the same person appears multiple times.\n\nEDIT: [Further reading](http://waitbutwhy.com/2014/01/your-family-past-present-and-future.html).
Where did you look? Out of the 3 meta Reno Mage decks listed on [Vicious Syndicate](http://www.vicioussyndicate.com/deck-library/mage-decks/reno-mage/) this week, 2 of them run the Solia/Pyroblast combo. 
Seems like a distinction without a difference. If I have to pay dues and can't negotiate my own employment terms, I'm effectively in the union. \n\nAll I'm saying is that any drivers that the union wants to negotiate for should get a vote. If some drivers are "too part-time" to get a vote, the same criteria should exclude them from membership and dues.
Why is that the only possible explanation? What if they were persuaded by BDS folks that going would be bad for their public images? 
A better source than the NYT, apparently. You can read tweets and direct quotes from the people involved.
But liberals hate that statistic, because they don't think that religious giving (even for things like soup kitchens) should count.
Why do you assume that you're in those situations? A lot of the skill in Hearthstone is building and choosing the right deck. In addition to deck choice, there are a lot of potential small leaks in your game, such as the mulligan. \n\nWhatever the reasons, the skill level of the top pro is the cap, and that those top pros can win 70-80% of their games at rank 5. That's not luck, no matter what you believe. If you're stuck at or near rank 5, you're nowhere near the skill cap, period.
This has been reposted here many times and there is basically no evidence that it ever happened. The only alleged source is someone who wasn't there and who has been caught making false statements in the past. [This gilded comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/5ldgdu/til_president_richard_nixon_ordered_a_tactical/dbux9sj/) from last time sums it up nicely.
> It is demonstrable that number one, there is no significant threat posed to this country by radical Islamic extremists. The number of Americans killed at home and abroad by Muslim extremists is something like nine per year, whereas the number killed by lightning is in the thousands, and the number killed by handgun violence is in the tens of thousands. As such, it is not about safety in any significant or meaningful way, and it is intellectually dishonest to contend otherwise.\n\nOver 200 Americans per year have been killed on US soil by terrorists since 2000. Obviously the bulk of that is 9/11, but the average in the last two years is still 35 per year. I'm not sure where you got the idea that thousands are killed by lightning; last year 23 Americans died that way.\n\nThis also ignores the 40+ refugees alone that, after passing vetting, have been convicted of terrorism since 9/11 ([source](http://www.sessions.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/news-releases?ID=FE9403D1-FBD1-4BCC-A0F9-16566A09079E)).
>Because it's a pen, no one needs to know you're actually recording\n\nWTF? Secretly recording conversations, even in person, is illegal in many parts of the world and up to [12 states](http://www.detectiveservices.com/2012/02/state-by-state-recording-laws/).
> And as all the bill did was make it so that these sort of people have to get a background check before purchasing, I cannot think this is a good idea.\n\nI don't think you have that quite right. As I understand it, the rule does not subject these people to an extra background check, it adds them to a list so that they fail a background check and cannot purchase a gun. It seems like there's a good reason that the ACLU, the NRA, and mental health groups would all agree that this regulation should be repealed.\n\nEDIT: the more important point here, which is the same regarding proposals to disallow people on the no-fly list to receive guns, is one of due process. The SSA determination described here is done by an employee in that office, rather than by any legal process that can be contested. If you want to take away someone's constitutional rights, they need to have a way to contest that decision in court.
> Oh no, Perry was just too stupid to realize (or check into) what the energy department actually does. Now that he knows that nuclear energy falls under the energy department, he regrets saying it should be booted out.\n\nIf you're referring to the New York Times article that claims this, that article was based on one source who says [they misquoted him](http://www.mediaite.com/online/new-york-times-faces-backlash-after-sole-source-repudiates-anti-rick-perry-story/), and who also wasn't even involved in the transition. You can also read a statement from Perry the day he was nominated where he talks about "safeguarding our nuclear arsenal".
I think there's an impasse, because Democrats want citizenship for illegals and Republicans will never accept that. Before any other issues, there is an electoral impact and it's hard for me to see either party budging on that.
Because pizza takes ~10 minutes to prep and bake, and most people want it fresh and to order. Drive-thru requires something that can either be premade or made within 1-2 minutes at most.
It is not a Muslim ban, and calling it one is incendiary and false. Muslims from nearly 200 countries, including nearly 50 Muslim-majority countries, are unaffected by this order.\n\nThere are a lot of things to criticize about this order, such as the confusion around green cards, the banning of entry for existing visa holders, and the lack of notice. But calling it something it isn't is counter-productive.
> So because children died in the past, you don't care if children die in the future. That's... weird.\n\nWhy do you assume that Hamas, etc., aren't already killing every Jew they can? Do you honestly believe that there are people who don't hate Israel enough to commit a suicide bombing now, but would if the embassy were moved?\n\nReductions in violence over the last several years are a result of the Israeli security apparatus and border walls, not some sudden increase in compassion among terrorists. The threat of violence from those who are already violent must not be a reason to not do something; if you want to argue that the embassy should not be moved you need to find another reason.
> Syria is good guy.\n\nYou do know that Assad has committed genocide and gassed his own people, right?
If it were so inclined, Israel could obliterate Gaza tomorrow. Literally, kill everyone there. Israel, of course, does not do so. \n\nConversely, using tunnels, rockets, and suicide bombs, Hamas kills every Israeli civilian it can. They consider marketplaces, buses, and schools legitimate targets. If it had the ability, Hamas would kill every Jew in Israel (don't believe me; they admit as much). \n\nThis is why there is no moral equivalence. Hamas has shown zero inclination to respect civilian life, so they don't get to have rockets and tunnels. \n 
> TIL that not using the same words as the government of Israel/military would use to describe people and events makes you Anti-Israel.\n\nBeing anti-fact makes you anti-Israel. The map at the opening has been widely debunked as nonsense. The entire thing after that reads straight out of Hamas propaganda. Take this for example:\n\n>One day in July 2014, a ceasefire was declared and Samar set off to her mother's home to collect her children. \nThe ceasefire was broken. \nSamar found herself in the street with her children trying to shelter from Israeli tank shelling. \n\nThe Israelis sound pretty bad in that story, until you go [read about it](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_the_2014_Israel%E2%80%93Gaza_conflict) and realize that all of the cease-fires during that month were proposed and entered by Israel (sometimes unilaterally), and rejected or broken by Hamas. I wonder why they wouldn't mention that this woman was shelled because her own government wouldn't even accept a cease-fire proposed by Egypt and the PLO, and agreed to unconditionally by Israel. I guess they omitted these facts to stay "neutral"?
I'm not sure what you're referring to. The population of Syria has been majority Arab since the Ottoman Empire. Syria was partitioned by the French as an Arab-led territory in 1918 and has been governed by Arabs since that time.\n\nWho are the "natives" you're referring to? Most of the non-Arab groups that have historically lived in that region are either largely gone elsewhere (Assyrian Christians, Armenians, Jews) or are not a significant portion of the refugees (Druze, Kurds). Do you have a source you can cite that says that today's Syrian population is not overwhelmingly Arab, as the CIA Factbook I linked above states?
> Syrians are not Arab\n\nWho told you that? The official name of Syria is the Syrian Arab Republic. According to the [CIA World Factbook](https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/sy.html), 90.3% of Syrians are Arabs. Most of the remainder are Kurds who live in Kurdistan and are not a large proportion of the regugeed.

This is not true ([source 1](http://work.chron.com/should-employer-ask-doctors-call-sick-25606.html), [source 2](http://money.usnews.com/money/blogs/outside-voices-careers/2015/09/21/whats-your-boss-allowed-to-ask-when-you-call-in-sick), [source 3](http://legalbeagle.com/6863547-employment-laws-doctors.html)). Your employer may require a doctor's note as a policy. This policy must be applied uniformly, and a note stating that you saw a doctor on X date is sufficient (the reason does not need to be specified).
The good news is that any timeline Pitino gives is highly suspect. Q could easily be back this weekend, and I could imagine Hicks being back much sooner than predicted as well.
That's all the rule says. I'm not sure intent matters though, in this case the defender clearly scored the ball (it certainly would not have gone in otherwise).\n\nI think in other situations that have been mentioned, such as a partially blocked shot going in, the officials would have to judge who "scored the field goal".
Who cares about legal obligations? To the extent that taking in refugees can be considered a moral imperative, it should apply more strongly to nearby Muslim nations than to far away Western ones.
Put a small bandage on your finger? 
I'm not sure where you got this idea. Jews vote approximately 70% Democrat. Major Jewish political groups like J Street always support Democrats. \n\nIs there a specific group you're referring to that generally supports Republicans but opposes Trump? Israel advocacy groups particularly like him.  
It's a 2 but not for the reason almost everyone in this thread thinks.\n\n[Women's NCAA basketball rules](http://www.ncaapublications.com/productdownloads/WBR17.pdf), rule 5.1.4(a):\n\n> When a player scores a field goal in the opponent’s basket, it shall count two points for the opponent regardless of the location on the playing court from where it was released.\n\nEven if the defender had been outside the 3 point arc, this would still count for 2 points.

Then, walk a mile north again, ending where you started.](/sp)\n\n[Note that the South Pole is not an answer. You cannot walk south from the South Pole.](/sp)
I'm surprised no one has mentioned **Power Grid** yet, which is my favorite implementation of turn order. \n\nWhoever is currently "winning" must go last in some phases and first in others, and due to the way resources are priced order really does matter. The game becomes a balancing act of trying to be in or near last place, so that you can make a move and win from there on the last turn, or maintaining a lead while playing with a disadvantage each round.
If someone drives only one night a week, will they be forced to join the union if these rules pass? If so, shouldn't they have the right to vote?

Well be a tough game for the Cards. On the road on short rest against a good team, missing Quentin Snider. Will need strong defense, rebounding, and good shot selection to stand a chance. 
It's untrue for a variety of reasons. The NCAA requires players to maintain a minimum GPA in order to remain academically eligible to play. Graduation rates and GPAs for the program as a whole most also be above a certain level or the school can be suspended from play (though this is certainly not a problem at Harvard).
I guess the question comes down to whether the deflecting played "scored" the field goal. In this case, they clearly did. If a ball is just slightly deflected, I'd say the shooter scored the basket so it's 3 points.
[538](http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-long-march-ahead-for-democrats/)'s analysis is that organizers always inflate crowd sizes. They estimate the Seattle march to have had 120k marchers, based on official estimates.

I wonder how detailed the calculation for missed Patches attacks was. For example, if there is a taunt up, it might be correct to not attack with patches in certain situations.

> Global Terrorism Index\n\nThis appears to be a measurement of terrorist attacks inside of a country, which is different than terrorism supported by a country. For example, India and Israel are ranked highly not because they produce terrorists, but because they are attacked by terrorists. I don't think it's a good metric for evaluating which country's citizens are risks to the US.\n\nIran is considered a state sponsor of terrorism and openly funds Hezbollah, a known terrorist group, which has been committing attacks against civilians for [over 30 years](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hezbollah#Alleged_suicide_and_terror_attacks). \n\nAlso worth noting, as has been pointed out many times, the list of countries in the order was not originated by Trump. These countries were designated as at high risk of terrorism by a bill passed nearly unanimously by Congress in 2014 and signed by Obama.
Many countries have capitals that are not the largest city or the most convenient to travel to. Does the US have its embassy outside the capital anywhere else? Should everyone move their US embassies to New York? Canadian embassies to Toronto? Australian embassies to Sydney?
Yes. I'm not sure why you would want to do that, though.

Except that Congress placed a hold on the money, which the administration agreed to and administrations traditionally respect. Though they were not legally obligated to hold that money back, if this was truly a matter of principle they would have released it prior to the election, not in the last hours of Obama's presidency.
Most of Redmond isn't that walkable. If you really want to be walking distance from shops/restaurants within Redmond city limits, you're basically confined to the Town Center/downtown/Education Hill area (essentially [this map](https://binged.it/2jk3R8V), or maybe north a bit). There is a lot of new housing in this area, but it will mostly be apartments/condos and might be a bit pricey. \n\nJust outside Redmond proper, you could also look at the Crossroads area of Bellevue just south of Microsoft campus, which will be more affordable and is also pretty walkable, or downtown Bellevue or Kirkland which are more walkable but also more expensive and a bit further away.

Taking a guess here. I suppose we can consider P(X>5000) = 1 - P(X<5000) = 1- P(Z<(5000-10600)/3500) = 1 - 0.05480 = 0.9452, so that under a binomial distribution mean, we have 200\\*0.9452 = about 189 franchises. \n\nTo be within the top 5, they must exceed the 195/200 percentile, or 0.975, which requires a z-score of 1.960. Solving for X, we have 1.960*3500+10600 = 17460.

As a Trump supporter, I think Obama's presidency wasn't too bad. But the shenanigans pulled by Hillary and DNC turned off a lot of people, including independents and Bernie supporters. I'm sure progressives are having a field day making silly jokes about Trump (preferable to rioting I guess), but at the end of the day, the Democrat party is still as morally bankrupt as ever.
You're a better person than I. Have an updoot
Suppose X = annual rate of return. Then E(X) = .1 and SD(X) = .04. (Note: I wasn't sure if we should use .1 or 1.1, i.e. the principal plus the return rate, so do consult with your professor on that). \n\nSo for part 1, we have P(X<0) = P(Z<(0-.1)/.04) = P(Z< -2.5) =  0.00621, by using a z-score table or the normal distribution CDF available in some calculators. I used this [website](http://stattrek.com/online-calculator/normal.aspx).\n\nFor part 2, we have P(X>.15) = P(Z>(.15-.1)/.04) = P(Z>1.25) = 1 - P(Z<1.25) = 0.10565.\n\nFor part 3, just re-do the above using the new parameter values. It's easy; just plug in the values. As for the advisement part, you could consider the probabilities. But the main thing is that we're given a better annual rate of return (12% versus 10%), which is obviously preferable if folks are willing to tolerate the increase in risk or volatility. I think there might be some financial economic formulas for a more technical and formal analysis, but I think that would be beyond the scope of this question. And as a note, we generally don't use the f(x) of the normal distribution, since we cannot (easily) integrate it to find the area... for our purposes, we use the z-score tables.

>Teachers deserve so, so much more than they get.\n\nPersonally, I think you can that for many kinds of professions, but that's just me. As for teachers, some are fortunate enough to get a class of students that are highly motivated and eager to learn. And then you have students that have... special needs. Bless those teachers with the courage and devotion to help those at the greatest risk.

Yep, it takes awhile to get used to. Although I think once you review a few more, it should get easier. Here's a typical one, from [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayes%27_theorem#Drug_testing), in case you haven't looked at it.\n\nIn my experience, the tricky part is when a problem is talking about events A with B simultaneously, but isn't really clear if they are referencing A|B, B|A or A ^ B. 
funny enough, I just tried the new tank with that very alias a few minutes ago! ;)
Just wanted to make a remark about (c). In the problem, it was given that the arrival process was Poisson with parameter λ = 2.1, per minute. As you did correctly, if the interval was changed to 10 minutes, then you would consider the adjusted parameter λt = (2.1)(10) = 21; intuitively, this makes sense. I suppose this stems from the fact that the sum of Poisson random variables (that are independent, but not necessarily with the same λ_*j*_) is also [Poisson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poisson_distribution#Sums_of_Poisson-distributed_random_variables). Under the Poisson distribution's properties, 21 = E(X) = Var(X).

A finer man than I can ever be. 
Can I get a random physics fact, please? :)
Not to say there aren't positives, but illegal immigrants often leave their hospital bills unpaid. Sanctuary cities may want them because of the perceived gains (of which I do not deny), but I wonder if they realize that there are reasons why hospital bills and insurance premiums go higher and higher, i.e. there are more people taking than there are people putting in. If we can reduce some of the people taking, then that's less financial stress on people actually footing the bill.\n\nTax-paying citizens also subsidize the children of illegal immigrants through schools (that get increasingly crowded, mind you)... this will last through college, once you factor in DREAM. Not to say there aren't positives from having educated people, legal or otherwise, but there are nonetheless growing costs. With teacher unions demanding higher salaries and pensions, this can get fiscally ugly real fist. And the shifting of financial aid money that could've gone to the citizens in the first place.\n\nIt's no secret there is noticeably more crime in impoverished, immigrant communities. That means citizens have to foot the bill for more police and counter-terrorism resources. With Democrats looking to double-down on more immigration (I guess that's more votes for them), that's going to increase our long-term liabilities, at the backs of others.
haha, I bet all the spam reporters were from those salty enoughtrumpspam fucks
I noticed you listed 7.6 twice at the top, but only used 7.6 once in the bottom. But if that isn't the issue, and although I'm not sure if my Excel computations are right, I got 0.432319326 and 0.455704583 as my standard deviations (using n and n-1 respectively).

Oh yes, certainly. I was saying what Bayes' would look like, in case it should be used. 
The media was talking about the threats non-stop, trying to validate the left-wing narrative of white racists being "emboldened". Seems like the only ones being emboldened are the race-baiters and hoaxers trying to take advantage...

Well, it's true though. Having been liberal for so long, I realized that most of the Democrat base are full of dunces that think they have the moral and logical high ground, which ultimately turned out to be a house of cards. I still have progressive values that wants to see better days for society, but I'm afraid most liberals are like hardcore evangelicals... they can't see past their self-righteousness.

Yes, I believe P(H|D) would be the way to go. This can be expressed as:\n\nP(H|D) = P(H ∩ D)/ P(D). Under Bayes' theorem, this is equivalent to [P(D|H)\\*P(H)]/P(D).\n\nNotation wise, besides "∩", you can use "and" or a comma to denote intersection of events.

>desperate poverty, environmental devastation, rampant corruption, and violent conflict which are the hallmarks of most of the capitalist world\n\nI don't necessarily disagree with you being that it's no secret capitalist countries have their fair share of issues, but even so, I don't think it's surprising why many folks try to move to capitalist countries, searching for a better life. But violent conflict isn't exclusive to capitalist nations, nor corruption and poverty. To one degree or another, it is perhaps minimized in some instances. I can perhaps agree with environmental devastation, but that can at least be explained by a growing consumer base, and folks trying to implement conservation efforts. As my parents and grandparents came from Communist countries whom witnessed their fair share of horrors, capitalism is like a dream to me... not perfect, but probably as good as it gets for now.

I might be a member of said cult, but even I would like to see some hard evidence. I can't expect people to take us seriously if we won't take ourselves seriously when it comes to backing up our claims (okay, I think our vocal critics will never take us too seriously given how polarized we are now, but nonetheless, I guess we'll see how this thing goes...)

>probability is the same on the interval 0 to 5 as it if from 3 to 8\n\nUnless I made a mistake, I don't think that's quite right. For \tλ = 1, F(8)-F(3) = about 0.04945, while F(5)-F(0) = about 0.99326. The memoryless property applies to conditional probabilities, be it for the exponential distribution or the geometric distribution.

you need to desensitize yourself by looking at more pictures of him then!
Yep, I think you're right. Although in my opinion, it's a bit of a weird question, since it's saying the number of entering customers is random, but it's also saying that the time to serve them is random. Because of that, I wonder if we still have a simply Poisson distribution. And what if the customer comes in a few minutes before the next hour... if it takes 10 on average, do we count the minutes that bleed into the next hour or not? Anyhow, in general, you can consider λt, for scenarios λ != 1.
But they are indeed correct however. Hate crimes have been rising during Obama's presidency, and perhaps even before then. This is mostly the ratings-driven media playing it up to "validate" people's narratives and feelings that there is a uptick, failing to consider past patterns, population proportions or the fact that a lot of it are not what you think. I don't doubt real bigotry exists, but you may want to educate yourself a little bit with /r/hatecrimehoaxes.

Ha. It will be my mission to remind them of how many cups they have every game. Every year. Until they have a cup.\n\nI'm hoping this becomes a lifetime of fun. I've never been able to shit on a team since the beginning.
I had some similar thoughts while reading before thinking she chooses to see the good in her life, what the hell am I doing with mine. \n\nYour post drove that home even more. I need to re evaluate my view and approach to my life. Thank you. 
Is Calgary an exception though?\n\nI admit there are some long term benefits but you can't ignore the claims if waste corruption or altogether lack of other benefits from the cost. \n\nLooking at what has remained and been used in all locations? Would it have been cheaper to build those directly instead of adding the overhead and issues of the Olympics overtop?
I'm tired of seeing people over 40 single handedly explain that cuts to my benefits and raises to my taxes are required to keep a system that my generation had nothing to do with running so boomers and gen xers can retire. The same people that warn social security programs are not sustainable and I should plan to privately fund my retirement. The same people who raid non related surplus funds to pay for their mistakes then expect us to make up the shortfalls. Then they explain they are concerned about my generation being able to pay for it down the road.\n\nIf they were so concerned they would try to fund their own retirement programs while making sure that my generation has the same benefits. They would worry about cutting back the benefits they gave their generation instead of demanding we pay for theirs while loosing our own.\n\nThis has very little to do with the article. I'm just tired of being attacked as a me first generation supposedly reponsible for all the world's problems when my generation was basically politically insignificant until 2015. Then I turn around and watch another govt, regardless of party, make a stupid decision to try and fix a previous stupid decision that ultimately makes my generation and the next one pay for it.\n\nAnd no I'm not an unemployed lazy millenial with a useless degree who lives in his parents home without a car.  I'm a married successful professional who works my ass off for what I have same as every other generation. I'm so tired of being told this is my generations fault while being expected to pay for it
I'm of two minds of the release. \n\nIn the age of wikileaks (hyperbolic i know) it would have leaked online eventually.  All major news media organizations had it for weeks, and If the present day can be used as justification for a historical act,  there is no shortage of leakers. \n\nBuzzfeed actually released it with the source and disclaimer. They told the truth about it. It was unverified, essentially unsourced,  and funded by opposition research on both sides of the aisle, and it was compiled by a group of opposition reserchers.\n\nIf the document was leaked online without that disclaimer,  how much more false information would be out there. Imagine if people believed for a time it was compiled by American intelligence agencies because the context was lost. I think people jumping to conclusions or spreading rumors is a safe bet.\n\nNow on the other hand did they need to release the whole thing? The Russian narrative had its own life already so the allegations related to that maybe.  The more salacious stuff could have been left out as an attempt at respect for a man who I don't think deserves it. That is more the style of tabloid rags but journalism is best when is rises above but cuts deep and sticks with the truth.
I didn't mean to imply they were making the donations for any specific reason. I expect there are many different reasons.\n\nI was arguing against dismissing their generosity because of some perceived personal benefit or otherwise assumed negative.
Pretty sure only the alt-right white nationalists want this guy. \n\nThe rest of the right and the left think he's an idiot. Or so I hope.
Makes sense. Thanks for the explanations.
My wife insisted on calling him booty the entire game so this is hilarious 
I will try to remember that.
Funny how disagreeing with him means you're brainwashed and part of the great conspiracy. \n\nIt's like his brain only has room for 2 categories. His worldview and the people conspiring against him.
We have dad depth. You've never seen a team with such dad depth. Even their third dad has serious top 6 dad chops.
He's being offensive for attention and pretending to care about a few causes to sucker idiots into thinking he's got character or substance.
That sounds like over attachment not friends. \n\nI don't even want to talk to my wife twice a day let alone my parents. 
People fall in and out of love at different speeds and times. If you truly think you can't or won't love her back as much as you are capable then you need to be fair to both of you and end it.\n\n6 months is a short time period in some ways. Falling in love and building love with someone are not the same. If you can and want to build that love and have that relationship with her then keep trying. Find a way to be closer, more open, more intimate.\n\nLove is hard. And it changes. One of the interesting things I've heard from an old married couple about their success was that they were lucky that they never fell out of love at the same time. I imagine to spend a life with someone involves self sacrifice and a lot of effort not matter how much or how quickly you love them at the start.
Agreed. I know buzzfeed is new to the game, and getting the scoop is so tempting, but sometimes you need to follow the lead of the old guys. \n\nI'm also really annoyed how Trump and his supporters jumped on CNN for reporting it after buzzfeed released it and Conway addressed it on TV.  Their reporting was accurate, added much more context including that the FBI had this information while it was, in an odd move, publicly informing congress they found more Clinton emails that were known to have no real value to the investigation. \n\nThe CNN article avoided the salacious parts, accurately reflected how un sourced the information was, showed a vast effort to corroborate unsuccessfully any of the allegations, and presented the paper trail of who knows about this. It was classic journalism, yet they are labeled "fake news" by a huge percentage of people.
Wow. Look at this asshole.\n\nMy autism is completely fine thank you very much. 
> Here's a link to his articles on observer's site\n\nThanks, I'll definitely check that out.\n\nThat's two good new sources I've got from reddit today, the other one more specific to my own national politics (Canada). This is a good day.
If you mean that for me, I suggest you read my post. I simply formatted his list, added a smaller edit showing easily found counter examples, and made a fairly short and in my opinion rational summary of how to the view all the events linked.
I love how people on the right are attacking CNN for having an opinion and news section, when they are staunch fox supporters that have the same damn thing.\n\nCNN, Fox, MSNBC all have shitty opinion pieces and entertainment sections, then real news sections. \n\nIts funny watching the left ignore that Fox opinion/entertainment isn't Fox news, and watching the right ignore the same about CNN/MSNBC.\n\nAlso "Fake news" assumes they post something with absolutely no basis in reality (i.e. a complete lie or misrepresentation), double down when confronted with the truth and refuse to publish retractions or corrections, continuing to spin lies. Breitbart is a pretty good right-wing example, as is "Rebel Media" in Canada. Buzzfeed was that on the left, but their journalism wing is slowly getting better.
The buzzfeed dossier was equally laughed at and stirred up concern over existing story lines (ties to russia) having more teeth than expected. \n\nIf true a foreign semi hostile power has strong ties to the new govt administration. If false then someone is pushing that narrative. Neither outcome is good for the US.\n\nThis is alleging what. That the FBI pursued legal warrants to tap phones of people not in government having discussions with a foreign power that is not an ally of the US? If it's true and Trump has an issue with it then Trump should suspend the legal framework that allowed those warrants to be approved. If it's fake then it's a non story to begin with. Either way the outcome is irrelevant.
Hey, you bring facts to an opinion discussion and I'll try to rationally analyze them and factor them into my opinion.\n\nNow I'm still of the opinion calling it a Muslim Ban rather than a more specific "Ban on Muslims from certain/7/these countries" is bad, but I have a huge personal bias towards clear/specific language rather than what I see is "convenient" or "descriptive enough" language. "Muslim Ban" is a great sound-bite and uses less twitter/sms characters, but in long form journalism, or discussions where we're being so overly anlaytical, descriptive, or even pedantic like I tend to be, i can't help but feel its lazy to use convenient even if generally accurate language. conveying that not ALL muslims are banned (yet) may be just as important, because that includes the knowledge that they are only partially done, and that they intend to continue legislation like this. Knowing this is in-progress and in flux may encourage people who generally feel the system has already beaten them to actually stand up and fight before its too late. 
>Anything pro Communism, or Naziism, is illegal.\n\nThat is both false and absurd...\n\n>And RW blogs are less sinister.\n\nWow, you must love that echo chamber.
Secret #1 for parents. When "throwing" something away, don't really throw it away.\n\nYou've likely paid for it already. Either keep it and give it back later, or keep it and hope it becomes a collectors item. Throwing it away is petty and vindictive
> violent agreement.\n\nHa. I had to read that twice. \n\nIt would be nice to see substantive and respectable discussion/debate rather than everyone agreeing.
I've heard that term only from the right.  Not even far right. Not once have I heard it from the left or far left.\n\nSpecifically on reddit it's used mostly by anti liberal anti left shills.
Wow the Republicans too something racist and tried to make it appear like a good thing.\n\nI'm not surprised. 
Has anyone done a good breakdown with sources and figures?\n\nI mean I've got 2 random people online saying opposite things. At this point give me sources or I'll be forced to conclude your both wrong and that Vancouver made billions off the Olympics.  That's how this works right?
I see what you mean.\n\nIs a buyout even an option from a financial standpoint?  What would that mean for a cap hit? 
But but 38 billion....\n\nIt's like the govt doesn't spend hundreds of billions on other interests and somehow only things they can link to their zionist worldwide conspiracy matter.\n\n
Except the fist think you learn in multiplication is 3x5 is the same as 5x3. \n\nTying this to advanced math like many are trying is absurd. The fact there is flexibility in getting to the right answer the the kid understands enough to go the more direct (5+5+5) route shows understanding.\n\nAs someone who's enjoyment in math in school started from finding out the different ways to do things and where that would break down, this curriculum would have destroyed my love of math and made me hate my teachers.\n\n
Naw. It's more for visual reference after they move the body. It doesn't have to be that accurate. The pictures are the accurate part. \n\nThey may even thank you. If you do a good job they might even hire you to do it next time.
Racial tensions is misleading? That is the most absurd and most hilarious thing I've heard today. Congratulations \n\nRacial tensions decribes the situation perfectly. Disagreeing with them doesn't change a descriptive observation based in fact.\n\nIt doesn't even matter if those tensions are based in reality. The fact is there has been increasing fear and tension all across the country whether you like it or not.\n\nNow if you want to blame the media for it go ahead. Those right wing fake news sites spreading lies and hate about minorities is a good place to start. Then the immigrant bashing idiots who don't understand the difference between legal residents who aren't white and illegal immigrants, or the difference between refugees and terrorists, or hell the difference between muslims and terrorists.\n\nThen if you're going after cnn you better go after fox and every other MSM organization , but please don't forget to distinguish between the talking head OP eds and the actual journalists. Don't see the difference? That's probably your problem to begin with.\n\nWait send them to guantanimo?  You want to send people you disagree with or don't like away to be tortured  and locked up for not commiting any crimes? What kind of unethical irrational narcissistic asshole are you trying to be come across as here?   
I feel you're trying to justify a bad decision by appealing to his motives. His motives are reason to do it right not to make bad decisions that avoids the burden of proof or the training that we expect the police to follow to ensure justice not vengeance is served.
> It's important to remember that corporations are a body of shareholders\n\nThey're also a body of employees, and their fudiciary duty places shareholders above employees.\n\nI actually support non-voting stock. its a way to allow an IPO and trading without unbalancing the company in the interest of shareholders (who may see it as a short or long term investment), vs employees (who tend to see jobs as longer term). \n\nAlternatively, give employees voting stock so they too are shareholders, as part of their employment agreement, instead of things like RSU's/options for non-voting stocks.
I like a good argument, but my past experience with him wasn't cogent arguments but emotional appeals and fairly ideologically narrow-minded points. Maybe I just read a few bad pieces and rushed to the wrong conclusion.\n\nI'll give him another shot, hopefully my initial judgement was wrong and I have another good op-ed writer to follow.

If you do want to raise a child and that truly is something important in your life, (presumptuous as it is for me to say) why let someone stop you?  Marriages end for so many legitimate reasons and conflicting life goals can easily be one.  We each can only be certain of this one life and should move in a direction of personal life fulfillment.  \n\nNot caring about anything as many suggest here can certainly give the sense of freedom.... but only if that's what you truly want for your life.  You have to choose your path, don't let others choose it for you by virtue of the relationships that you have formed and/or events in the past.  \n\nNow is all any of us actually have at any given moment.
>Was Fox News in my post?\n\nTechnically MSNBC wasn't in your post either. I was pointing out the massive flaws in attacking one organization on one political spectrum when they all are the same, and the 'examples' most people bring up as better are actually much, much worse.\n\n>Seeing CNN is the worst example of news in the USA does not put Fox on a pedestal.\n\nExcept it isn't the worse at ALL. I would say Breitbart is getting pretty close to the most fake, lying, unsourced bullshit "news" organization out there.\n\n>I also disagree with your definition of fake news. If the news lies, omits, or misleads it is not reporting accurately and referred to as fake news.\n\nLet me explain why your definition is the same as mine, but slightly less accurate:\n\n* Lies: Covered in my definition\n* Omits/misleads: Covered in my definition under lie->misrepresentaiton\n* Reported accurately: is too ambiguous (i.e. information that changes after being reported). However, my definition covers when they refuse to publish retractions or corrections for mistakes. Mistakes are made, integrity is when you own up to those mistakes. If they don't, then they reported inaccurately and refuse to admit it, so they're pushing fake news and have proven their intent is to lie.\n\nSo basically you agree exactly with my definition but in less specific or accurate terms. \n\nI assume you don't like my definition because the "retraction/correction" detail. That is what sets CNN, Fox, MSNBC news apart from the lie-filled echo chambers of Breitbart/Buzzfeed or the opinion talking heads on the CNN/Fox/MSNBC network, and completely invalidates any attempt to ignorantly paint them as "fake news".\n\n>My reference to CNN and wiki leaks was an outright lie.\n\nYou'll notice I didn't respond to what you said, but what you're trying to accomplish (attacking a news network). The fact you did it with an outright lie shows your intentions are far from honest, and I doubt this discussion is going to go anywhere productive.

I mean if you're doing a good job why be demoted to advisor? The best people would just move on to better jobs and you're left with the next candidate who may or may not be as good as the current one.\n\nThinking of it as a selection process,  adding an artificial limit like term length limits competition allowing less suitable candidates a chance go succeed by timing rather than by fitness.\n\nThere is also the problem of pensions. You get a full pension after 2 terms isn't it? Limits only increases the number of pensioners the govt needs to pay. It's probably a drop in the bucket, I don't know the numbers.\n\n
I don't get why Republicans didn't immediately freak out.\n\nIt's not the governments job to pick winners and loosers. Govt interference leads to a less efficient market. Trump removing needed regulations or subsidizing the industry in any way is exactly what Republicans argue against.\n\nOh wait,  that's only when the Democrats had the idea first.
They act as a mild deterrent for some people. If there are signs about the camera's it might (unlikely?) discourage the neighbor from trying something like that.
I wasn't sure the exact related clause so I over generalized there. Besides that did I get the general gist of things though?
From what I've seen, It's a completely self enabled echo chamber reinforcing tool independently created by that echo chamber.\n\nIts not censorship if people ignore someone. If people decide to ignore someone for stupid reasons then so be it.\n\nIt's a public forum. Free speech has never divorced someone from the consequences of their words or actions. If others decide to judge people for posting or being members here that it their right to do that. \n\nEcho chambers are stupid and dangerous yet people have the right to put on whatever ideological blinders they want to. 
Damn! I can't say I'm surprised\n\nClinton wasn't a good candidate to line up behind in retrospect, her baggage real and imagined killed the whole party. Screwing over Sanders alienated their most vocal and passionate members, and their response to Trump has felt like more noise than substance (although how much substance they could actually have is questionable considering the seat counts)\n\nI pretty much can understand any American mad at everyone in the system, and I have trouble understanding those that approve of it in any way. Trump's trying to trample on constitutional rights yet the Right is suspiciously silent, and the left is too busy taking cheap shots at the president and mis characterizing absolutely everything for anyone who isn't brain dead to want to listen to them anymore.
That's one way to look at it. Glass half full / half empty I guess. 
That's what I don't get. I've been trying to understand why people who have issues of corporate power in government elected a corporate power who filled his cabinet with corporate representation and then but a ban on other corporations lobbying them.

I love how Americans are full of pride and go around saying they're the best at everything (which is pretty easy to disprove, but who cares), but someone else is proud of their country and they're acting, for lack of a better way to characterize your stance, "uppity"?\n\n>Alaska itself could probably invade you at any time.\n\nAmusing, obviously and patently false, but amusing. 
This is my favorite !
The slippery slope argument (basically what you are saying) doesn't work.\n\nI don't call it a Muslim ban because it doesn't apply to most muslims.\n\nIf it applied to all of them or even a majority of them I'd consider that more accurate. \n\nBut the fact that more muslims are not impacted by this mean calling it a Muslim ban is eitjer innacurate or dishonest.\n
Definitely. you don't get the "thats cool" reaction when one of the steps shows unprotected child labor using acid to dissolve the plastic and breathing in the fumes.

Well like every job the qualifications are different for each role.\n\nDevos is a perfect example. Her only experience with education is advocating against government funding for public schools. She doesn't have any experience in management, education, or frankly anything that would make her suitable for the job. She doesn't have an education degree or one aimed at education either.\n\nIt was patently obvious during her hearings. The actual ongoing issues in the field and department were completely foreign to her. She didn't even understand the questions.\n\nNow an example of someone qualified is Mattis. Relevant experience and qualifications, and is respected in the community as someone who knows what he's talking about.\n\nThen you go back to Rick Perry, who had no idea what the department he was nominated to even does. His experience and past shows he had a huge bias against the accepted scientific evidence yet is put in charge of the dept expected to follow the science.\n\nThen you have tillerson. He has no diplomatic experience in govt, no experience working for the massive and complex state dept, and by all evidence his management and tactics are making it impossible for the state dept to function. Which is fine because as unqualified as tillerson is diplomacy is being handled by trumps son in law who has even less relevant experience. \n\nDon't get me started on the head of the EPA, or nominating a known racist as the AG in a time of racial tensions who while qualified is completely unsuitable. His decisions are mostly bad, polarizing and short sighted\n
Also methane breaks down into co2 and other things, so you get the full impact of methane then a secondary impact of co2.\n\nNot sure if the byproducts are included in that number. 
I'm the same way but I love it. I'm not really attached to my family though. 
You can nominate unqualified people. Look his cabinet. Look up the definition of oxymoron.\n\nTrump says something stupid and uninformed. A bunch of people correct him and his supporters like you try to defend him and look stupid.
Maybe not in your echo chamber but it was in mine.
Who the fuck do you think you are telling him to fuck off. Why don't you take that fuck off and fuck right off with it.  
Which is why it was repealed i think.  Basically anything that isn't bring enforced yet is being overturned. The first few months of this administration seems to be trying to turn back the last few months of the last administration. 
THIS\n\nIt seems so ridiculous that somebody on the left would pay for people to behave like this.  To what end?  It's only serving to make moderate people on the left want to distance themselves from the left all together.  What's the point?
Aaaand there are too many players on the court...\n\nEdit: looks like I can't count.  There are 10, but it's been pointed out there appears to be a guy in a black t-shirt.  One could assume that he might be on the red team.
Burpees are an exercise, not a workout.
Did you read the article you linked?\n\n> Criminal lawyer Howard Cohen adds that there is a "huge misconception" in Canada regarding the use of self-defence, and many people think they don't have any rights.\n\n>The laws around self-defence are a grey area — the criminal code states a property owner can only make a citizens arrest if the alleged wrongdoer is caught in the act. But many people don't take in to account, "the flexibility and reasonableness of our juries," a factor that has affected many cases where people have acted to defend themselves or their property, Cohen says.\n\n...\n\n>The three men were charged with kidnapping, carrying a dangerous weapon — a boxcutter— assault, and forcible confinement in the case. The accused thief, meanwhile, pleaded guilty to robbing the store and was sentenced to 30 days in jail. Prosecutors later dropped the kidnapping and weapons charges against Chen and his two employees, but went ahead with the other charges in which the three men were eventually found not guilty.\n\nAs a Canadian, living in Canada, I'm calling bullshit on this. We have no issues with self-defense. We have issues with people using things like pre-emptive violence, castle doctrine, stand-your-ground type logic to escalate situations into more violent and deadly encounters. \n\nIt turns out to work, we have less per capita violent crimes in nearly all comparisons, and do not have an issue with people who defend themselves going to Jail.
Fellow Canadian, great post.\n\nI have no issues with guns. I go to the range with friends sometimes, planning on getting my PAL and maybe RPAL to pick up a handgun for target shooting, and considering maybe a long gun to go hunting with friends. \n\nI have absolutely no issues with our gun laws and restrictions. I've got some issues with how the RCMP interprets and applies the laws sometimes erratically, but overall I'd rather err on the side of caution and more restrictive laws than allow more guns in the streets and more gun violence in our country.
Strange but effective 
using a true statement about A, to prove point B when A does not equal evidence for B, it lying.\n\nIts making an intentionally false statement. The statement:\n\n>We have 93 million people out of work. They look for jobs, they give up, and all of a sudden, statistically, they're considered employed.\n\n93 million people out of work <- true if you're talking about people outside of the workforce by choice or by situation (too young, too old). \n\n> They look for jobs, they give up,\n\nThe subject he's talking about is unemployment (those who want jobs but can't find them), or underemployment (who can't find jobs equal to skills and qualifications). The fact about 93 million people above has no relevance to the subject, thus using the fact to back a different subject is intentionally stating something false.\n\n> and all of a sudden, statistically, they're considered employed.\n\nThis isn't strictly true either, they're considered unemployed or underemployed in most cases, but its less of a lie and more of a broadly misleading statement in conjunction with the lie told above.\n\n
My understanding is he has to waive his contract in order for the pens to have the option not to protect him. So either he ends up a free agent and is gone either in the expansion or next round of trades or Pittsburgh protects him and he stays.\n\nNot sure how they fit Murray in there. 
Honestly reject the alt right and white nationalists, and stop telling lies to the public. Oh and accept scientific concensus. \n\nThe first got him elected so I don't see that happening and the second seems to be his personality for the last 4 decades so I don't see that changing either.\n\nBut if he did. I'd give him a shot.
Can^i^come^too?
So here is the problem. Even lacking evidence, I wouldn't put it past some people on the left to do this. I wouldn't put it past some people on the right to do this pretending to be on the left.\n\nIts gotten to the point that both sides are so suspect for not shutting down their own crazy's that I'm just standing here scratching my head, wondering if anyone is actually honestly representing themselves and their opinions. Its almost ridiculous that we have to wait for the fact checking for every god damn thing these days.
Why such a large cut and behind the nail instead of beside it?
Macdonald bought/buys mean from a company called 100% beef. 
Its a shame. A few years back everyone was cutting funding for remote/foreign journalism, and falling back to just parroting local third party sources. I've felt there was a significant drop in quality in reporting of significant events outside of the US/Commonwealth since then.\n\nI didn't even hear about the assassination attempt. Something else to look into.

A Procrastroidator
> He has advocated against the current US system which rewards whoever is most willing to flaunt US immigration law.\n\nBefore he was in office the number of illegal immigrants was down, and deportations were the highest they've been in the last two decades. Real, legal immigration was up, and working.\n\nTrump comes in, stepped up illegal immigrant enforcement against all the evidence that his actions will have more negative impacts on the economy than positive. He at least promised to "Fix" the problem that didn't exist, now he's pretending his actions are fixing the non-existent problem and ignoring the actual problems he's creating. That isn't to disagree with your statement, that's just analyzing trumps lack of understanding of the situations he's dealing with (who knew healthcare was hard...)\n\nWhere you actually go wrong is where he's advocated for lists detailing crimes committed by immigrants, nominated a racist AG and a white-supremacist as his chief white house strategist, promised and is trying to Ban Muslims from entering the US, and stopped accepting refugees. All of those are anti-legal immigration, not illegal immigration, if not directly than optically.\n\nHis actions have been to hurt the american economy by unreasonably stepping up immigration enforcement for a problem that was already going down and being eliminated at a pace that did not hurt the country. His actions have been to either outright ban or stop legal immigrants and refugees from entering the country (which was struck down by the courts thankfully), and finally he's making the US unappealing for all sorts of legal immigrants. \n\nThen he turns around and advocates for a system like Australia and Canada and his supporters are pretending his immigration policy is sane now? His two example systems take in lots of refugees despite his anti-refugee stance, and both countries have significant Muslim immigration despite his anti-Muslim stance? His examples are very contrary to his promises and policies, but you believe this statement over all past statements and evidence to the contrary?\n\nIt sounds more like Trump advocating for a more Canadian/Australian immigration system is trump not understanding, yet again, what the fuck he's talking about.
You and me both!. \n\nI grew up with my parents refusing to shop at the co-op because it was 'communist'... how brainwashed some people are.
It's a mess, but this seems a new low.
I'm with you there. Let's hope for that trend continuing and the shit dying down happening sooner rather than later.  
Co2 has a much longer half life iirc, even if it's 25x less potent as a greenhouse gas and ends up being 1/10th the mass it's lingering impacts are from my understanding measurable and not insignificant \n\nMaybe it doesn't really matter. We're arguing over how bad exactly something it but i imagine we both think it's bad and needs to stop. 
ha, /r/theydidthemath  \n\nThanks, I actually wondered about that as soon as I read it.
You're missing the lawsuits where the police pay millions or the odd but rare situation where someone is fired. \n\nIt's almost like allowing people to do something like this without restrictions or guidelines will result in abuse. How will they answer for every innocent life they ruin?

His promise is to ban Muslims from entering the US. His approach banned Muslims from specific countries (before being struck down).\n\nNow if you want to move to a points based system then fine, but at the same time, Trump promised more than just changing the basic selection criteria for immigrating to the US, so the assumption is that the "bad" impacts of his current attempt are not relevant?\n\nRefugees are considered immigrants, and both countries he pointed to have immigration systems that are refugee friendly, against his stated intentions and his attempted action.\n\n>That would certainly be a bad thing and I am wholeheartedly against policies that would do that without some sort of large benefit.\n\nSo what's your view on his plan to publish crimes committed by immigrants? \n\n>I've always advocated for a strict points based immigration system and I was happy to hear him speak to the same goal. I didn't vote for him, but this was a breath of fresh air away from the lawless system we've had in place.\n\nThe Lawless system that was deporting illegal immigrants back at the highest rate possibly ever? That actually reduced the number of illegal immigrants by a significant amount and was on track to continue? Lawless is a far cry from accurate description of the system in the US before Trump. Things were not perfect, but they were no where near as bad as some are trying to paint things, including you from the look of things.\n\n>Trump's immigration plan would allow for about the same refugees as Canada and more than Australia. Furthermore, Australia has been accused of torturing asylum seekers. The facts show that Trump's refugee plan is comparable to Canada and more open than Australia.\n\nHis suspension on Syrian refugees is only ended when an ambiguously worded goal is reached. If he removes that suspension close to the 120 day suspension on all other refugee's I'll be very pleasantly surprised, but I wouldn't be surprised to see it still in effect this time next year, or indefinitely.\n\nPer-Capita, or per dollar of GDP, the US takes no where near the number of refugees as either country. They take the same number as Canada despite 10x the population, and 3-5x more than Australia despite being 13x the population.

The Nazis first came to power using elections: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adolf_Hitler's_rise_to_power\n\nIn a sense they even rigged elections using violence and intimidation: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_federal_election,_March_1933\n\nYou could probably say they weren't fully fascist though until they outlawed elections so your point mostly still stands.   Plus I think people throw around the word "fascist" way too much in general. You don't have to be fascist to be evil.  The worst "fascist" has begun to lose all meaning at this point, in much the same way racist has.  \n\nBut technically the Nazis couldn't have put a fascist government in place if they hadn't won elections and also rigged them with violence to get to power in the first place.

What part are you freaked out about?  The IQ stuff?  That's just factually true.\n\nOn average women do better on IQ tests than men and may even be smarter than them ON AVERAGE.  But there are more men at either extreme.  So there are more really dumb men than really dumb women, but there are also more SUPER SMART men than super smart women.\n\nThat's a proven fact.\n\nSo if you think it through rather than retreating to your safe space you'll realize that if men are pushed out of the job market and you replace them with women, you'll find you'll have a shortage of super smart people in the job market.

No. It does not make me ignore anything. It does rile others up and cause overreaction as exemplified by your response in which you resort to ad hominem attacks against me.
Sounds nice. Both sides think they are doing that though.

As soon as I could I moved far, far away. We don't agree on, well, pretty much everything, from serious matters like religion and politics, to more mundane stuff like cultural stuff (movies, books, etc). I was never "cast out," and we get along fine on the rare occasions I go back home, but that's mainly down to the fact that I just bite my tongue, don't say what I'm really thinking, and do my best to accommodate them with whatever's necessary. So, yeah, I guess it'd be fair to say I just never could "fit in." What's more, I sure as shit don't want to, and I'm fine with that.

Angela Merkel. I'm a democratic socialist (in American this translates to: "commie fag"). She's center-right, but has worked with the leftist parties during her chancellorship to make Germany an economic powerhouse that is open to immigration (kinda) and ok with socially liberal policies. She is overwhelmingly popular, reasonable, considered and erudite. She would never want to be a world leader, which is partly why I think she's the best choice.

Based on a "real" character from fiction? Howabout Cassandra, who was doomed to foresee all of the calamities that would happen in the future but powerless to prevent/affect them? That's some fucked up useless shit.

I kinda hate to even write this here, b/c I'm a fairly rational and logical guy, and I would never admit this out loud to anyone IRL, but this is the internet, so...\n\nI think I sometimes have what I call micro-flashes of the future. They're really stupid, boring, idiotic things, believe me I'm NOT trying to say I'm psychic. But I'll give you some examples I can remember from the past month or two.\n\nUsually what happens is some random word or idea pops into my head, usually in the morning, just outta nowhere. And then later in the day, somehow, I come across that word. And I'm not talking common words like "cat" or "fucktard." For example, the other day, outta nowhere the city "Brest" in France pops into my head, probably while I was in the shower or shaving or something, and sure enough, later that day I read a news story about Brest. Or just a week or so ago the word "aubergine" pops in my head, which being American I never use and have only seen in print, and sure enough, later as I'm reading a novel that word gets used twice.\n\nI know it sounds crazy and I probably just have mis-firing neurons and/or am remembering wrong, but, well, u asked.

I'm an atheist, who used to be mad all the time, and isn't really anymore ... I'll try and give a genuine response.\n\nFor many (perhaps most) atheists, they take on their identity as an atheist in their teens or early 20s. This is a time when all sorts of identities are being established (what kinda crowd you hang with, what kinda clothes you wear, what kinda music you like, who you like to date, etc). These decisions are important for establishing what kind of adult you will become.\n\nBecoming an atheist is not only a logical and sensible thing to do (from the POV of the atheist, anyway) but also a rebellion of sorts, a rejection of one facet of the dominant culture. In establishing an identity that is a rejection of what most of the dominant culture believes, you only have a few options: a) rage against the machine, and fight it as much as you can b) conceal that part of your identity c) accept your difference from the majority and kinda shrug it off. \n\nB & C atheists you rarely hear from. I know, I'm one of them now, and I don't bring up religion as a topic of conversation, and if directly asked I demur or offer some kind of non-committal response that hints that I'd like to change subjects. I should also add that I'm 33 now, and have not always been this way.\n\nWhen I was in my teens and early twenties, I fucking loved arguing with people about religion, and because I felt my identity needed to be established and empowered, I was clearly very much a type "A" atheist. Type A atheists are, imho, either insecure about their position in the world, or young and still finding themselves, or most commonly, both, and that is why you find so many angry atheists on the internet and occasionally IRL.\n\nThere are, of course, the mature angry type A atheists, too, but there's a word for those guys: assholes. And of course assholes come in every stripe.

Yes, you can leave the airport. Seoul is an hour or so away on the train. There's loads to do there. Your request is very non-specific, but if I were a newbie traveler in Seoul for 12 hours, I'd probably go to a palace, have a nice bowl of dolsot bibimbap, buy something in Insadong then go back to the airport.
The show peaked for me in late season 5 and early season 6. Seasons 1 n 2 were fairly meh, it wasn't until 3 that the show seemed to really find its footing and take off. This is by no means an original take, of course, I'd say it's the general consensus.

They kept looking back at me and saying relatively innocuous things like "look, there's a foreigner!" etc etc n mom was like "shutup! that's rude" while I pretended not to understand and read my Kindle.\n\nSeriously, tho, around kids of a certain age and disposition, I'm a walking conversation starter, and try to avoid them as much as I can.

Such a strategy relies on all members of both parties voluntarily switching alignment for virtually no reason at all. In reality, this is democrats deflecting their old slavery-loving ways on republicans. This really is all it amounts to. I'm a libertarian, so I don't have a dog in your left-right bullshit fight, but this "the old racist democrats became republicans and vice versa" thing is so beyond stupid it's insulting.

I'm a strident opponent of calorie deficits. I much prefer fasting. One might ask "what's the difference?" Here's the difference - While eating on a deficit, you are still eating (i.e. in a "fed state"). You are getting food, but not enough food, and your body will lower your metabolism to match the intake.\n\nIn a fasted state, it's been shown that your metabolism actually INCREASES. From an evolutionary standpoint, if you didn't have food available, and your body lowered your metabolism, then you'd be unable to catch food, and then you'd waste. Instead, your body ups the metabolism to help you hunt.\n\nLots of metabolic damage can occur from eating on deficit diets. And then, once you return your intake to normal levels, you're actually at a SURPLUS and not isocaloric, since you lowered your metabolism previously.\n\nhttps://intensivedietarymanagement.com/caloric-reduction-vs-fasting-part-9/\n\nEDIT: Why is this being downvoted? If you disagree, have a discussion or present some evidence to the contrary. The downvote button is for the weak-minded. Grow up.
Is it the "right wing" who is constantly rioting due to people having "different views?" Must have missed that.\n\nThe left wing pathology of revisionism is bordering on mental illness.

His last video he said he was over 105. 105 > 94. The record for the 220 lbs class is 901 lbs. Soooooooooooooo....
It's not that metabolism increases by a lot during fasting, it's that it doesn't decrease.
I'm ready. Educate me.
I was making a point about how changing one word makes the counterpoint valid, aka maybe get your own house in order.
Could have recorded video and then done a frame capture. Maybe saved HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF EXPOSURES.
Eating at a deficit will slow your metabolism. If you're going to cut, I'd do intermittent fasting instead of calorie restriction. Lots of info on why that occurs that online.\n\nAs an example, yesterday I squatted 320 lbs for reps while fasted (16 hours since last meal). I've also squatted heavy after having not eaten in over 40 hours. 
Where's that at? I moved to Seattle from Cambridge about 18 months ago. Don't miss the snow, but miss the city.\n\nI've been riding consistently up here in the Pac North West all year.

But, as it stands, we barely get any snow.\n\nEDIT: I saw below that it's Lake Q in Wakefield. 
I've posted a form check when I was having a bad day and wanted advice on a specific aspect of my lifting, and got a lot of "you need to start over completely" comments. It's to the point of not being useful anymore. \n\nForm checks are apparently for people who have been lifting for 3 days, or for people who are high level lifters just so they can post a "[Form Check] 250kg clean at 10kg BW LOL" ego stroke.

Ever tried intermittent fasting? I eat a low carb diet and intermittent fast daily. As a matter of fact, I've only ever been able to achieve ketosis from fasting.\n\nFasting is more powerful than keto as far as insulin control, so maybe something like 16:8 or alternate-day fasting would suit you well.

Well, doing the math:\n\n4 12v batteries in series is 48v. Multiplying by 12ah gives 576 watt-hours. Let's not assume you always draw 1000w. It's DC, but let's assume something like an RMS draw from the motor, so that's 1000/SQRT(2) = 707 watts. So 576w-hr/707w = 49 minutes of riding.  But that's pretty balls to the wall riding, so if you did something more reasonable like a 300w average draw, now you're talking 1.92 hours. Which, if you figure an average speed of 15mph, is about 29 miles.

Part of the issue is that the transgender community wants it both ways. They legitimize their condition by arguing that they have abnormal brains (and therefore it isn't a contrived condition), while simultaneously arguing that they AREN'T abnormal (vehemently). This leads to a lack of mental health treatment for them, resulting in an extremely high suicide rate. They self-treat by undergoing transition, but that clearly doesn't work (again, see suicide rate). Politics has created a stigma against classifying transgenderism as a mental disorder (despite literally being one), so they get nearly zero professional help. We don't do this for any other mental condition.\n\nEDIT: And I understand that there's not as much social support for them as there could be. But there's plenty of social groups who experience rejection without the astronomical suicide rate. Something else is afoot.

Well, of course ingesting any amount of calories isn't strictly fasted. Bulletproof coffee uses butter, which has carbs in it, and therefore creates an insulin response. However, if you were to make your coffee with ghee (clarified) butter, then the carbs are absent, and the insulin response from this is very, very small.\n\nTL;DR - Ingesting pure fat creates a negligible insulin response, maintaining you in a fat-burning state, albeit not strictly fasted.\n\nEDIT: I just finished "The Complete Guide to Fasting" by Dr. Jason Fung, which provides a lot of detailed science on fasting. He provides a list of fasting-friendly beverages that, when taken in moderation, won't break your fast. However, he specifically says bulletproof coffee WILL break your fast.

They'll always use enhanced interrogation whether or not Trump tells them to, it's the CIA, no one knows what happens behind closed doors.
Don't worry French politics are in a very similar situation to America's, the kick back against corporate controlled politicians and far leftist ideals is being felt throughout the west. And trust in the mainstream media is at an all time low. It's a good time to be a moderate conservative. 
Thank you for your reply, lets talk and see if we can come to an understanding. I call myself a conservative because I agree with fiscal conservative policy, specifically lower taxes and less government intervention. Socially I am a centrist, the closest approximation would be a classical liberal. In terms of governmental power, call me a libertarian. I don't like the federal government having as much reach as it currently does. My opinion on this has always been that individual states are too unique in the problems they face for the federal government to legislate effective solutions to these problems in a nation wide fashion. That is my general stance on policy.\n\nnow if I may address some of what you said previously,\n"But the general phenomenon that calls itself "conservatism" in this country (despite its increasing radicalism) has been psychopathic for several decades now, and if you believe what you say, then you have seen that happen and are equally concerned about it."\n\nI'm not entirely sure I follow you here, so correct me if I misinterpret your thoughts. Radical conservatism has only just cropped up into the public discourse, it take the name alt-right today. While yes these guys have been around for a while they only started to gain strength as the left became more radical. several years ago it was common for liberals to write posts that basically said 'i don't agree with what you say, but I'll die to protect you're right to say it'. That dedication to free speech was admirable, but that faded away. Today, it is far more common to see leftists calling for censorship of opinions they disagree with. Safe spaces on college campuses where ideas are discussed without allowing for debate or counter argument. Trigger warnings to prevent hurt feelings. That's just the small stuff, massive corporations like google are developing AI to censor "offensive speech" on the internet. Now its the moderate conservatives who are dedicated to free speech, who protect people's right to criticize anything and everything. This radicalization of the left turned many people away and pushed some conservatives further right, in physics terms it was an "equal and opposite reaction"\n\nIn response to the false equivalency you claim I made between antifa and the alt-right, I was not speaking in terms of current political power, I was talking about the ideas they profess. You are correct about the alt-right wanting an ethnic cleansing. We agree that is absolute nonsense, and no one who is even remotely moderate agrees with them. On the other side we have anarchist communists (an oxymoron if I ever heard one), who think that communism is somehow a good thing.\n\n"I don't pretend at all - I state it as an absolute and undeniable fact. The left in the United States is utterly morally immaculate compared to the right."\n\nHere is where I take some serious issue. If you genuinely view the right with that much contempt then I see no hope of coming to any sort of common ground with you. To state one ideology is morally superior to another is somehow a fact is nonsense. We don't have to agree, but we also don't need to hate each other for our personal beliefs. Honestly this is dangerously similar to religious war in my opinion.\n\n "The right just gets crazier and more evil with every passing year"\n\nFunny, I can say the same about the left, but only if I treat it like a monolith, which I don't. There are plenty of reasonable people on both sides of the aisle, and in your rush to attack conservatism you make the mistake of collectivizing everyone who isn't with you 100%. \n\n"That is why we compare the right to Nazism. Because it has become Nazism"\n\nNo, the closest thing to a Nazi on the right is the alt-right, and they will fizzle and die over the course of the next few years, you know how I know? because they are doing exactly what the far left did. They call it race realism, where they do poor statistical analysis and jump to conclusions. The prime example the alt right uses is government welfare programs that 'whites' pay into and 'blacks' take out of. Their solution is as you correctly stated, 'ethnic cleansing'. This is BS, if there is a problem we should be able to solve it without deporting huge fractions of the population. Treating their opposition as a collective is much more convenient for their argument, as it has been for the far left. On the topic of Steve Bannon, that guy is an opportunist, plane and simple. Should he have any power? absolutely not. Can you trust his stated opinion to be his real opinion? Nope. \n\n"The choice is on you. Continue to promulgate these laughable false equivalencies in the face of immediate facts and it will be clear you choose to serve liars."\n\nTo me, this sounds a lot like "join us or you're a Nazi"\nand to that, the only thing I can say is no thanks. You haven't provided any significant facts to alter my position. instead you implied I have no concept of reality. You believe I have a warped sense of morality. And you are so deeply rooted in your ideology you seem unable to criticize it. Conservatives aren't fascists and we aren't evil. Neither is your side, all we need is some civil discussion. There are always people willing to talk, and work together. Don't treat conservatism like a monolith, and you might realize there is a massive difference between Trump-ism and conservatism. \n\nIf you want to talk about a specific issue name it and I am more than happy to state my opinion, and reasoning.
Let's do a little digging shall we? Trump's defense secretary is general James Mattis, who has come out as being very anti torture. So while Trump says one thing his actions say another. He may have said to please some people much further right than myself. Or maybe he said it because he enjoys saying idiotic things. Point being it doesn't matter what Trump said, it only matters what Trump does, and by choosing a defense secretary who is firmly against the use of torture his intentions are clear.
Republicans were irrelevant for a time but now they are on the rise, the demographics for the upcoming generation put them at moderate right of center. If you think gerrymandering is the only reason, news flash: Democrats gerrymander too. Not saying it's a good thing, but remember there is corruption on both sides.
You missed that small part where the FBI told the White House that they did not believe the reporting was accurate. The White House responded by asking them to report this to the public, and they refused. But from the article title it sounds like the White House wanted the FBI to subvert the media. Sorry but this article has some blatant spin on it. 
Don't get me wrong, I know very well that leftists are not all anti-fa members, but when I say mainstream left I am in fact referring to the mainstream left. I think within the past 8 years the mainstream left moved away from liberalism, and that is an important distinction to make. The liberals you speak of are no longer the mainstream left.\n\nAnd to clarify, we don't need to stop calling them snowflakes, we just need to be aware that it isn't a substitute for an argument. 
There are many more conservatives like me, we are pretty reasonable people but we tend to keep to ourselves. I came over here to see what you guys think. It's an attempt to keep myself from getting locked in an ideological bubble. \n\nNow you say conservatism is "a runaway train to atrocity" what specifically are you talking about?\n\nOn the civil war stuff, no one is salty about losing it because no one who was alive during the civil war is around now. And I'm not sure how you managed to convince yourself conservatives lost the civil war, it was the democrats leading the south at the time. But whatever, this is a non issue as I mentioned above.\n\nOn the topic of "Texas oil billionaires" ah yeah, not saying we don't have some sketchy figures on this side, but your side has the same damn problem. Does the name George Soros mean anything to you? If not look him up, he has done some very sketchy stuff with his money. Or perhaps you dislike foreign governments interfering in elections, I'm sure we can agree on that. If you look at donations to the Clinton foundation we see money coming from middle eastern governments like Saudi Arabia. Why would a foreign government donate money to a foreign charity instead of spending that money on charity in their own countries as they see fit. It's a problem on both sides, and it's solved by removing big money from politics. \n\n\nYou say conservatives are enraged that women aren't our property. Enraged about every single iota of progress made since the Magna Carta. This is not true in the slightest, I don't know a single person, conservative or liberal that believes this. Complete fabrication. If I'm wrong you're going to need to show me proof. \n\nAs for honesty and conservatism, I Was honest with myself, I analyzed issues from as many sides as I could, and more often than not I come back to the moderate conservative position with a few alterations on specific issues. Can you honestly say you have done the same with your ideology? Because your pure distain toward conservatives says otherwise. \n\nI too want politics to be an amiable discussion, so does every other moderate on both the left and the right. Which leads me to believe you were talking to the far right, and as I have mentioned they do not represent all of conservatism. And if you expressed your 'distaste' for conservatives in a similar way to them as you have to me, well... let's just say moderates tend to be more patient than partisans.
Conservative here - let's take a step back for a second and be reasonable. I know we probably don't agree on much, but we both want to do what we think is best for the country. That should be the driving force behind discussion of issues, figuring out what problems need to be solved and how to go about it. But when it comes to cooperating and listening to each other, calling us Nazis doesn't help, so I ask you who is really impeding cooperation here. \n\nIf you think the alt right represents the modern conservative movement, then I could make an equivalent statement that Anti-fa represents liberals. Both statements are BS. We can get along but don't pretend the left isn't any less guilty than the right for the current state of public discourse.\n\n
Agreed, we just need to make sure they don't drag us with them when they kick the bucket. 
Let's take it easy with the confirmation bias guys, if we take numbers like this at face value we are no different than the leftists who do the same. Can't forget that Fox News is a part of the MSM and it has a narrative it wants to push as well. What we really need is an alternative to the mainstream that is dedicated to impartial reporting, if anyone has any recommendations I would appreciate it.
Yeah probably, I don't agree with the war on drugs, the method it uses to reduce addiction in the population is ineffective in my view but yes you are probably right.
The lack of critical thinking, in my opinion is due to the groupthink encouraged by the left. Safe spaces where certain ideas cannot be challenged. Political correctness to silence decent. It all encourages people to think in the same way. For example if someone told you their stance on one particular political issue, say immigration, you could probably take a guess at their stance on every other political issue following party lines. That is terrifying because now the party politics the founders warned us about have extended beyond politicians and into the population.
In an ideal world I would actually see this as a good thing, less govt over reach, in some sense it sounds very libertarian but that's not really what he means unfortunately, I'm all for getting rid of useless regulation that drives up the cost of business but some of these environmental regulations were reasonable and necessary. 
A) link to specific study or article?\nB) if those studies were done with the same methodology as the "73 cents on the dollar" study then they didn't take into account hours worked, which is a huge reason behind the earnings gap. \nC) this article is still comparing wages across fields, the fact that wages change over time happens to many fields due to changes in technology that make the job easier. Furthermore this can also be explained by the same mechanism I described in B\nD) don't get me wrong, paying women less for the same work is bad and shouldn't be allowed to happen, the point I want to make is that the current statistics and data we have on the matter are being pushed with confirmation bias, instead of proper skepticism.
And my argument is his actions matter more, do you disagree?
But there is no pay gap, it's already illegal to pay people differently for the same work. The pay gap to be "addressed" doesn't. Exist for the reasons you think it does. The 73 cents on the dollar figure comes from a study that just averaged the earnings of men and women across all fields and compared them. It did not compare earnings between people within the same field. It is nothing more than a propaganda statistic that is easy to quote but isn't useful in proving anything. Assuming sexism is the cause without doing a basic amount of analysis on the data is academically lazy and dishonest. This has nothing to do with who is the "bread winner" and more to do with proper data analysis.
Your ideological partisanship will be your undoing. It seems you have self radicalized into far left rhetoric and doctrine. You have become the very evil you claim to fight. Take an honest look at conservatives, as individuals, not the extremists on the far right. You may find we aren't the sheep of Fox News you believe us to be.\n\nAs for the civil war stuff, yes I understand what you are saying. If you investigate the history behind it more you will find the republicans didn't change, rather the democrats did a complete 180 on their views and tried to out liberal the republicans. Which they did. So you are correct that the parties switched sides, but it was the democrats who said well have those n*****s voting democratic for the next hundred years. And sure enough through welfare payments your sacred party managed to keep many African Americans under their thumb. But I digress, this happened a long time ago.\n\nOn the topic of Trump, he isn't a conservative, the bully tactics he uses are no different than those Obama used, Obama just did a better job at sugar coating them.\n\nGeorge Soros as Emanuel Goldstein? I don't agree, if anyone is Emanuel Goldstein right now it's Trump. Hear me out, who is being held up by the left as "Literally Hitler" right now? Who has endless amounts of hatred directed at him for no other reason than that he has been named the enemy of the people? Trump. I don't agree with Trump on much, he is way too authoritarian for me. But to say he is trying to end the democracy that elected him is absurd. Yes his comments and actions toward the media are unacceptable, but their journalistic integrity has become unacceptable, nothing more than hit pieces and character assassination coming from left long media outlets. If you want to talk about Trump pick a specific policy he has enacted or claims he will enact and we can talk about that.\n\nAs for the Clinton foundation, don't be that Naive, it's being used as a front for bribes, that should be obvious based on the people donating to it and the amount of aid it actually puts out.\n\nAs for Russian employees controlling reddit? Please Russia has far more important things to do. If you are referring to the Donald, then yeah they definitely use their numbers to mess with posts, but Reddit in general has a left lean so this shouldn't have been an issue anyway. \n\n\nFrankly the Russia election stuff is nonsense. Yes they were clearly pro Trump, and yes there is grounds for investigation but if you want to talk about election fraud all you need to do is look at the DNC. They screwed Bernie by issuing independent voters absentee ballots at the polls, these ballots were then never counted. And as most of Bernie's support came from independents, he was left up shits creek without a paddle. Think about it, he drew huge numbers to his rallies, but when the votes came in, those numbers weren't there. Once again, didn't agree with Bernie in the slightest, but that kind of malicious dishonest should be considered unacceptable to anyone who cares about our democratic process. \n\n\nI am aware of trumps people saying exactly that kind of stuff, and yeah that bothers the hell out of me, the same way the dishonest of the far left bothers me. We are only talking about ideological extremes here, but they don't  accurately represent the majority of moderates stuck in the middle. As for Steve Bannon, I previously mentioned he is an opportunist who says what ever he has to gain power, and the people he is speaking to are specifically the alt-right, just to keep them on Trumps side. And as mentioned before the alt-right will only last as long as far left does. Without anyone calling for an ethnic cleansing of whites, there will be no reason for the alt-right to call for an ethnic cleansing of everyone else. Simply put the alt-right is nothing more than a reaction to the far left.\n\nConservatives turned to Trump because he is immune to political correctness, which is nothing more than 1984 newspeak that is used to forcibly censor conservative view points. The moderates that came to support Trump did so because they were not being heard by the government. It was the left's reckless use of political correctness as a political weapon that had caused the current political climate. It doesn't matter way you spin it, the left lost its ability to argue, and instead turned to collectivism and censorship as a substitute for evidence and analysis. 
Your right it probably is, but I seriously doubt this will matter 4 years from now.
That's what I'm worried about, when the democrats finally calm down, our side may not be prepared to debate them. The same way they weren't prepared to debate us.
The fact that he dropped the toy as soon as he realized she wasn't there is what makes this for me.

How would this work? What constitutes a robot worth taxing vs a tool?  \n\nIt's not clear to me how this would work without a ton of loopholes (e.g. We only have one robot, it just services many stores.) or unintended consequences (we would buy this technology that would make the workplace safer, but its technically a robot so we won't).  
I am leaning to the thought that /u/jonesrr2 saw a different poll from the economist, but its impossible to know without see any sources! \n\nUltimately, I also really dislike the "narrative" shit. I just want to be informed. I am not pushing any agenda.  No one on reddit is my enemy in my eyes, just people I can discuss things with. 
>Economist shows a growing approval which you just "somehow" didn't mention lol.\n\nWhat? Look at the source I provided. the first column is approval and it has gone down with time since he took office. It clearly shows he went from 53% to 45% this week with register voters. So I don't see how I somehow didn't mention it. \n\n Get out of here with that scare quote nonsense and implications I am being deceptive. I am a fair person and am doing nothing intellectually dishonest here. I have provided sources for everything I said, and merely asked questions. \n\nI am legitimately interested in being factually accurate even if the facts don't agree with what I want. With all the evidence I have seen so far in my own research, some of which I have posted here, Trump does not seem to be gaining approval with time. \n\n\nThat is where you come in. You are telling me that the Economist has Trump gaining approval, but what I have seen shows otherwise. Please provide the source you have showing Trump's approval is increasing and stop it with the scare quotes nonsense. \n\nEdit: p.s. the source is litteraly from the YouGov website:\n\nhttps://today.yougov.com/news/categories/politics/\n\nClick on the "Weekly Political Tracking Report February 27 2017" at the top right. YouGov is polling for the Economist.
Never claimed it was nice. The fact remains that your aunt fantasizes about having the moral high ground and protecting her bathroom from people she doesn't like. Intolerant, sure, but not news worthy. If you called the cops to reoort her they would be very confused about why you thought that was worth reporting.\n\nOn the flip side, how many of your relatives threaten to murder people on facebook? Do you think your aunt would ever express the desire to kill someone? \n\nBecause that is what people are talking about here. Not "I dont like trans people and dont want to be around them", but "I will kill them".\n\nYour example is just an example, sure, but its on the complete opposite side of the spectrum. People say intollerant things all the time and that sucks, but it isn't the issue. Threatening to kill people is the issue. The people above think its normal to have friends that threaten to kill people on facebook. \n\nNot intolerant aunt normal, but hate crime felon normal.

>It's regressive because it affects the poor more than the rich. A poor man spends more % of his income on groceries such as Mt Dew and sweet tea than a middle class or wealthy man even though they may consume equal amounts.\n\n\nThat's exactly the same for tobacco and alcohol taxes as well. \n\n>The problem only really starts IMO when you have a situation with tap water being poisoned by lead etc and the fact that water in some places is more expensive than soda. But there are bigger problems in those cases already than this tax.\n\nThat isn't the case in philly though, so kind of a moot point. \n\nAlso, where on earth is water more expensive than soda? Every walmart/HEB/random grocery store I've been in sells 1 gallon jugs of water for around ~$.70. Distilled is around $1. I've never seen a gallon of soda anywhere close to that cheap. Even the no name stuff is typically more than that for only 2L/half a gallon! \n
Yeah, I can share some of my cleaned up data too. No need to duplicate work!
In my experiences from TAing, a depressingly high number. You don't realize how poorly students prepare and understand materials until you teach them for a while. 
>Because it makes no observable predictions other than you must add it to make your theory that it exists for it work. It does not predict anything other than its need for its own existence.\n\n It predicted the signature from the bullet cluster exactly before we had seen it. 
So? I'm just responding to the claim that it makes no observable predictions. It does. One was borne out, the others are currently under investigation. Galactic rotation curves are not predicted by dark matter, they predate it. The bullet cluster came after dark matter was theorized. 
That is fun haha. I haven't heard of that one.  However, that also would have issues explaining the bullet cluster. 
That's a good idea! Thanks!
That's bad, but not "I will kill trans people" bad. I would say there is a big difference between saying you will kick trans people out of bathrooms and saying you will kill trans people. 
Interactions:\n\n1. Gravitationally force: by definition it does\n\n2. Weak force: quite possibly\n\n3. Strong: probably not\n\n4. Nope\n\n\nHow to see it:\n\n1. Galactic rotation curves: measured and agrees with DM\n\n2. Lensing: measured and agrees with DM\n\n3. Direct detection: scattering experiments that see the small (but measureable) energy deposition as dark matter passes through matter (underway)\n\n4. Colliders: Produce dark matter and see a it's "signature" (underway)\n\n5. Annihilation signatures or other cosmological searches like the OP (underway)\n\nWith all that said, we don't know its there. 1 and 2 (under how we see it) highly suggest it is there, but we won't know until 3,4, or 5 finds something or 1 and 2 are explained in other ways. \n\n\nFun fact, a particle that looks just like dark matter exists and can be easily seen and detected: the neutrino. A really heavy neutrino would actually be a great dark matter candidate. \n\n\n\n
I don't see how antagonist training would help with offsetting the effects of this. Antagonist training is helpful for balancing out a strong muscle. Shrugging your shoulders up when hangboarding doesn't make your pulling muscles stronger. 
Are we pretending that tap water isn't a thing?
It shows:\n\n1. The climbers face and muscles.\n\n2. Something dynamic e.g. reaching for something\n\n3. The height/terrain\n\n4. It's a relatively easy to access perspective\n\n5. The composition is naturally pretty solid and interesting. e.g. diagonal lines, climber being near the middle and large in the frame makes it easy to use for a magazine picture\n\n\nTo expand upon it: the easiest pictures are taken from a perspective near the wall as that requires the least setup. \n\nSo you can be below or above the climber. Below the climber isn't interesting. No perspective on height and shot of the but. So above it is.\n\nBut above to the side is more interesting as it shows the whole body enabling you to see the action rather than just a head + arms reaching straight up. \n\nOf course, you want to take the photo when the climber is actually reaching, and you want them to be reaching with their far arm so they are turned towards you, because again, front > back \n\nCongrats, now you too can take cliched climbing photos! jkjk\n
Axions are one of many popular potential types of dark matter that are being considered. 
I am no expert, but your tendons don't connect all the way at the tip of your finger, so if it is actually near the tip of your finger it probably isn't bowstringing. \n\nThat said, I wouldn't ignore it. \n\n\nhttps://www.researchgate.net/profile/Jennifer_Wolf2/publication/7330846/figure/fig3/AS:277725316173838@1443226283678/Figure-3-A-Normal-tendon-mechanics-with-intact-pulley-system-B-Bowstringing-The.png\n
I simply don't understand why we have such distinct experiences. I have plenty of conservative friends, none threaten to kill trans people openly on facebook. Is that normal to some people? "Oh, that's just Bob, he likes to post death threats on Tuesdays".
Yeah I want to be clear that I am not trying to diminish the accomplishment at all! The route looks plenty hards. I just don't understand what is going on. 
Family can still though. 
 OP wants to measure how much grease is left in the pan, and it's far easier to just measure the pan before and after than try and scrape all that grease onto a new plate and loose some quantity to the pan/scraping implement.\n\nFor me, I have a sourdough culture I keep in a jar with a known weight so I don't have to try to transport goop around and clean it all the time. Far easier to remember the jar is 312 grams and subtract that out.

I mentioned that before literally right above your comment:\n\n>So if you live in a food desert in Flint Michigan (there is a walmart there), and for some reason you don't get the free water deliveries to your door or go to the walmart or any other big box grocery store, I suppose that you might have to pay the same (or slightly greater) cost for water as soda.\n\n1. They get free water delivery to their door upon request. \n\n2. There are plenty of places to get water cheaper than soda there, I checked.\n\nNot a great counter example. 
Yeah exactly.
I use preferments a lot, but I dont think it makes the bread less chewy. What do you mean?
I don't claim to know the answers, but I'll explain why I think the way I do here right or wrong. Please let me know why you think they way you do. I would love to be proven wrong.\n\nFirst off, this is why I don't think they are a good climbing excercise:\n\nTheir emphasis is on the posterior chain, which is not a limiting factor for the vast majority of climbers. Seriously, I've never personally come off a problem or seen someone come off a problem and complain that they would have made it if only their glutes/hamstring hadn't given out. \n\nBut they do hit the back, core, and grip, but the grip is a crushing grip which has very limited carry over and the back work is limited at low weights (like, less than 3x bw) and is isometric and doesn't carry over well to climbing. More importantly, you would be far better off training other exercises for all three if that was your concern. (e.g. barbell rows which hit the back and core in a much nicer package for climbing). \n\nEvery ounce of effort spent deadlifting would be better spent climbing or doing some other exercises for someone who only cared about climbing performance. Deadlifting is too draining and not nearly specific enough to be all that useful.\n\nThis also is kinda silly, but it also is known to build muscle in your legs, which really is only hurtful. Leg strength is not that useful. I am not convinced you need to have much more strength than the ability to do a pistol squat which is born out by other climbers recommendations. e.g. http://www.stevemaischtraining.com/the-economics-of-training.html which recomends a bodyweight squat for 15 reps is the most you will see performance benefits out of for climbing. That's a pretty low bar.\n\n----------------------------------------\n\n\nOk, but I also don't think it correlates well with climbing either. I get that from both my experiences and a bit of data I have been looking at. It's hard to talk about personal experience, but I can point out this situation right here. \n\nYou are deadlifting ~1x your BW and bouldering V8! I don't mean to offend you, but you are bouldering at an advanced level and deadlifting at a untrained/novice level. http://www.exrx.net/Testing/WeightLifting/DeadliftStandards.html\n\nYou are the perfect example of why deadlifting doesn't correlate well with climbing. If it did, you would have needed to build up the strength to deadlift much higher, or at least beyond an untrained/novice level just to reach V8. Since you didn't, that indicates that climbing isn't relying on your deadlift strength much. Case in point, I bet your pullup/grip strength numbers are not untrained or novice level. \n\nLastly, I've just been looking at a survey here and its very much not supportive of leg training (which I would classify deadlift as mostly). Climbers that train legs actually perform worse on average! That isn't to say that there is a causal relationship there, but it certainly isn't supportive of the idea that leg training predicts climbing performance in a positive way. Here is a graph showing that the non-legs training population climbs harder:\n\nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/0B6yGsEhKdFOpRUlCUklxSjhSaDQ/view?usp=sharing\n\n(y axis: 90% bouldering grade, x axis: 0 doesn't train legs, 1 does)\n\nSome one else did a peer reviewed paper on something similar: http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/17461391.2010.546431?scroll=top&needAccess=true\n\nIt doesn't test deadlift strength, but guess what? \n\n>The proposed structural model, with latent variable hand–arm strength and endurance (developed from reference values for simple tests), indicated by three manifest variables (grip strength, bent-arm hang, and finger hang) and three exogenous variables (body fat, volume of climbing, and climbing experience), explained 97% of the variance in climbing performance. \n\nWith 97% of variance explained, there isn't much room for deadlifting ability to explain climbing ability. \n\n\n---------------------------------------\n\nWith all that said, I am not sure in my thinking. All the evidence I've seen indicates to me that deadlifting is not good training for climbing or a good predictor of climbing.\n\n\nSo ill ask you the same question: where are you getting the idea that deadlifts are good climbing training/do predict climbing performance?
The expire meant was set up so that if you flipped a coin it would be right 50% of the time. In other words, people did no better than pure chance. 
V9 is just outside the upper bound for 1.36. What do you climb 90% and what's the hardest youve climbing in the last three months? 
I looked at some pictures, it does look beautiful. 
Yep, haha. Supposed to be EM! 
Physicists use the word theory to describe a model. It doesn't have to be right, wrong, testable, etc... No one calls models hypothesis. 
90% as in "The V grade you can send 90-100% of routes". \n\nMoon Boards should be pretty standardized though. 
That has more to do with the experiment than the truth value of the claims. The speed of light is something you can easily understand and even measure yourself. CP voliolating kaon decays? Not so much. 
I'm not sure in that case.
No one wants to acknowledge that its the same thing either way. When my party does it, it is justified, when the other party does it, it is disrespectful. 
Would it be a good idea to just buy some lecithin? It seems like it isn't expensive stuff. 
The starting left foot and right hand look super pink. At least they are closer in color to the pink route than the big red pinch!
There are lots of guys that championed that model. Well, were anyways. MOND (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modified_Newtonian_dynamics) was pretty popular, if never the forerunning theory to explain galactic rotaion curves, but over time more and more observations were made that were perfect fits for dark matter and really hard to explain with MOND.\n\nAt this point MOND requires some serious mathematical gymnastics to make work. MOND + dark matter is probably more likely than MOND without dark matter. Or at least easier to understand. \n\nTo see a good example of the observations I am talking about, look up the bullet cluster. 
Not in this case. It should be the grade you've done in the last three months: v9. The model predicts V6 as you 90% grade. There is a 1.5 grade wiggle room there, so V6 to V7 is to be expected.
I work in high energy physics and can tell you that people use the word theory to refer to unproven models. I've used the word that way in peer reviewed papers and talks with no complaints.  \n\nIf you disagree and want to tell everyone how I am wrong, that's fine.  I don't care to argue endlessly about semantics and will bow out here. 
They probably exist. SM neutrinos are not enough to explain all the observations, but other types of neutrinos being investigated (e.g. sterile neutrinos) 
Sure, you can project at the gym. To be more precises: projecting vs climbing routes at or near your level.  
I don't think even experts would do this. Putting down a knife and picking up a bench scraper is wasted time.  
In fact, when he used the tube to pick the magnet up off the table, there was no spin at all. 
Soulstone is a World of Warcraft thing as well.  Cast by a Warlock, it provides 10 minutes of safety from death, allowing you to revive yourself.
Imagine we did a study like this and asked if cat was different from no cat:\n\n||cat|no cat\n|-:-|-:-|-:-\n|mental health issue|10|15\n|no mental health issue|20|30\n\nWell, in this case owning a cat does not predict that you have a mental illness. But of course, this also implies that having a mental illness is not a predictor of having a cat!\n\nSo you tend get the same results doing it backwards or forwards. 
Not talking about dough.\n\n
It is possible, but I think much less likely than dark matter. There are a lot of seperate reasons to suspect that dark matter like particles exist. If they do, they could explain tons of things depending on their properties very elegantly. 
There are lots of people working on doing what you are suggesting, including established journals. \n\nFor example, nature was working on some journal where you publish a result and anyone can go review it. The issue was that no one actually did go review the work. \n\nStill, people are working on it. Traditional journals use highly qualified and expensive editors, and have already convinced people they don't suck. Any free or open source journal needs to find a way around expensive editors or find a new source of funding as well as convince people that they do a decent job with peer review. \\
Ok, that changes things quite a bit haha. 
For projecting or just climbing at the gym?
What is an athletic body to you? \n\nA beach body?\n\nA body capable of excelling in many sports?\n\nA body capable of climbing hard?\n\nYou will only really get the last one through bouldering. That isn't to say that climbing can't make you look better or do better in other sports, but it is by far not enough if you want to look "aesthetic" or dunk a ball. \n
Thanks for the suggestion. 
I'm skeptical that this is true, or that micro jaggies cause sticking. After all, chicken wont stick to a cold pan. They only stick when cooking which seems to indicate its a chemical, not a physical, thing. 
I don't think the OP thought this was a permanent strategy, and I do think it is good advice. If you are overweight, loosing weight is a good idea for climbing as it dramatically improves your upper end strength to weight ratio, reduces stress on your tendons, and is something you are going to have to do eventually if you want to climb hard anyways. How many male pro-climbers have a BMI over 21? Most are 20 +/-1 for a reason.\n\nThe OP here was 5'11" and 180+ lbs (BMI: 25)\n\nOndra is 6'1" and 150lbs (BMI: 20)\n\nIt was a smart training move for the OP to cut down 15 lbs, and would probably be positively served by cutting down to a BMI of 20 (145) over the course of a couple years if he really wants to climb super hard. So yeah, as seemingly silly as it sounds, loosing 20 more pounds might actually get OP on the right path to projecting v9s...
There is evidence of dark matter besides rotation curves. The bullet cluster is the most famous example. It shows that there is lots of matter in clusters that can't be seen and doesn't interact. The case for dark matter is very strong. Many separate observations are consistent with it and many theories predict particles like it. 
You'll get back to it soon though. Good luck and see a hand doctor if things aren't slowly improving. 
That's a disadvantage for this technique too: it requires a long,straight obstruction free path, not just a single spot, to work. 
Makes it easier to lose or get stolen. 
I agree completely with the latter statements. However, I do bet that Will Anglin could physically hang from an edge before V13 even if he didn't try it.
We call it "string theory" despite the fact that it has no observational evidence at all.\n\nOn the flip side, quantum field theory is also called a theory, but is well supported. What gives?\n\nYour definition is one of many, but it is not the only one used in real life by physicists. I've been a grad student in high energy physics for enough years now that I know how the word "theory" is used in practice, but to be honest I haven't looked it up in a dictionary. \n\nHowever, what I do know is that physicists use the word "theory" to refer to models and so on that are not proven. I don't know the dictionary definition (I can't even remember the last time I cracked open a dictionary), but I know how it is used in conferences, papers, classes, and in everyday discussions amongst physicists. 
Your deadlift has very little correlation to climbing, so I don't think it is that weird. 
No, because dark matter referse to one model the predicts there is unseen matter. Other theories that explain the same issue without extra matter are already called different things. E.G. MOND.
In a different world, you would be quite right. The same is true for skin color as well-it's a pretty small difference in the scheme of things.  Neither your sexual orientation nor your skin color make you all that different, but individuals do get treated quite differently because of it and that makes it a very alien trait. \n\nAgain, there is nothing intrinsic about the trait that makes it alien, its all in our perception, but that does create a huge and very really effect on the people affected by that perception. \n\nDid you ever have a moment where you were amongst a group of people but felt out of place? Its not a big deal to have that happen every now and then, but imagine feeling that 24/7 and you might see why it is refreshing to meet up with people who don't make you feel that way.

>Polls only show a piece of the pie and methodology/participants play an important factor. It's difficult to take a small sample and extrapolate it to the rest of the nation.\n\nAgreed, but real clear politics is a combination of a lot of polls with several methodologies. It isn't vulnerable to sample size or methodology issues as much as many polls are. That isn't to say it is perfect: one could argue the numbers are subject to systematic biases and such. \n\nHowever, the overall trend is likely to be much more robust. If Trump gains in popularity, we should expect to see an increase in favorability in the polls even if the polls are systematically biased. \n\n>Anyone who took a stats course or two (I took several since my major was research focused) would tell people to be careful about blindly believing poll numbers.\n\nYou understands statistics so you should understand that while blind faith is bad correctly applied polling and statistics is a powerful tool. More over, you should read up on the polls used by real clear and their methodologies before blindly passing judgement. \n\nBut either way, if you reject the poll I posted, you should also reject /u/KeyBoard_Warrior2017's statement that Trump is gaining in popularity. If you can't trust polls, then how can you make statements about popularity at all?\n\nFor fun, here is their poll showing the rise of Trump:\n\nhttp://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2016/president/us/2016_republican_presidential_nomination-3823.html\n\n

Rejection of science is not uniquely conservative. \n\nFor example, being anti-GMO or anti-vaccines is very bipartisan. \n\nGlobal warming deniers tend to be conservative, but this can be explained by conservatives dislike of policy change and government spending, not unique anti-science attitudes seen on the right. \n\nhttp://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0075637
Good call, 18mm. \n\nThe no hang from the link is 14mm. 
Yeah, so actually the economist shows a growing disapproval for Trump:\n\nLook at the first table in the link bellow. On Jan 20, the disapproval was at 44%, and it has steadily rose to 51%. Approval was at 53% and it has steadily dropped to 45%.\n\nhttps://d25d2506sfb94s.cloudfront.net/cumulus_uploads/document/k33vwv7sxh/trackingreport.pdf\n\nNot sure what you are refering to with MC. McClatchy/Marist? 
Doesn't surprise me at all. I had a student in a calculus based physics course simplify x/(x+2) = 1/2 as they thought they could cancel the x on the top and bottom. 
Wait, so if a route has 10 moves with 3 at your limit, you would wait 20+ minutes?\n\n
By default the creator of the art gets the rights, not the subject. \n\nHowever, you can negotiate that. Models do negotiate similar things so that both the model and the photographer can put the images in their portfolios. \n\nChances are you signed a release of some kind. If you didn't, then the photographer can't really publish the image anyways. \n\nIf you really feel sour about the rights to the image, just ask that you get 50% of the rights (in contract form) and don't agree to have your picture taken otherwise. \n\n\n\n\n\n
Clever thought! However, dark matter probably has to be traveling fairly slowly to explain the universe we see:\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hot_dark_matter
Ah ok, that isn't the case at my gym, so that threw me off. Thanks for the explanation. What about the starting pinkish holds? Are those red actually?
But the hold colors start pink, go to white volumes, and then end red. How do you know the white volumes are on? How do you know those pink crimps everywhere are off? \n\nHonestly, it looks like the V4 is a vertical pink crimp route. It's really throwing me off haha. 
Dang, that is crazy to me. I'll typically set aside 15 minutes per problem when at the gym and I'll max rest 2-3 minutes between attempts. That allows me to climb 4-5 different yet difficult problems in a session. \n\nIn my personal philosophy, I think the added volume climbing per session with 2-3 minute rests is more important than whatever performance boost you get out of a 10 minute rest. Of course, when projecting a route, I'll happily rest longer and really work at it, but I don't project routes most days when I am climbing. \n\nWhy do you take 10 minute rests?  \n\n
You are the only one talking about safe spaces. 
I didn't buy it, but I think it was some bread made by a local big box store baker. I looked something similar to this:\n\nhttp://penniwisner.com/ancient-grain-seeded-no-knead-sourdough-bread/\n\nBut crustier and a bit more open.  
I see what you are saying, but if you are willing to ignore the basic logic of arithmetic, then really it can be any value you want it to be. 
Well, the reason I guess that is because of this which indicates evaporation is playing some kind of role, especially at the edges. \n\n>L. Keiser et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. (2017)\nA drop of water-alcohol mixture on a layer of sunflower oil first spreads and then contracts as it emits droplets. Blue dye improves the fluid’s visibility. (Frame is about 10 cm across.) At first, if the initial alcohol fraction is above 0.35, the mixture spreads, but after a few seconds of alcohol evaporation, the surface tensions increase, causing the spreading to reverse. The most significant evaporation occurs at the puddle’s shallow edges, so the surface tension at the edges becomes larger than at the center. This surface-tension difference leads to an outward fluid flow that results in fluid bursting out of the puddle and producing thousands of droplets. The team can adjust the droplet diameter from a few micrometers to a fraction of a millimeter by varying the alcohol-to-water ratio, and they can rapidly produce as many as ten million droplets.
That would be an issue if walmart was the only place to get cheap, safe drinking water. Food deserts still usually have drinkable tap water.
90% of Americans live within 15 minutes of a Walmart and that is just one big box store. That means 90% of the nation can buy water much, much cheaper than soda at walmart alone. \n\nhttp://www.statisticbrain.com/wal-mart-company-statistics/\n\n\nMoreover, in my experience, water isn't cheaper than soda at gas stations always. TBH its almost always the same cost. \n\nMoreover, most Americans have drinkable tap water. \n\nSo if you live in a food desert in Flint Michigan (there is a walmart there), and for some reason you don't get the free water deliveries to your door or go to the walmart or any other big box grocery store, I suppose that you might have to pay the same (or slightly greater) cost for water as soda. \n\nThis seems like a non-issue to me. \n\n
Well kinda because the cartoon actually says the words "conservative agenda". 
Heart rate variability and http://smudge.io/cnstaptest/. \n\nI don't know what the best protocol is. Measuring multiple ones is probably best, but ultimately most people choose one and track it. Any deviation from the norm can be a sign of something wrong, but typically fatigue is associated with a dip or increase in the measure. It depends on the test.

And then you're forced to _prove_ that he knew it was false when he said it, and paying out the ass for lawyers while you do it.\n\nIt's much, much safer to stick with objectively unimpeachable criticisms.  Saying his claim is false is much safer than saying he's lying.
Oh, I doubt he killed her intentionally. That was more a hypothetical reasoning, based on what he'd said he wanted to do.
You know they didn't start with camps, right?  The camps came about because there were logistical issues with mass deportations.  Can't ship them out fast enough, have to put them somewhere so you can keep track of them.  Running out of room to hold them, start killing them to make room.  While you've got them there, might as well use them for slave labor.\n\n7 million deportations would be over 18,000 767's full of people.

Congrats, you work harder than a lot of Americans. Do you get paid more than minimum wage?   Do you get overtime?   Can you complain to your boss without fear of deportation? 
I don't really understand what you're arguing here.  If a company thinks it's right to defend you, it will.  If a company thinks it's not right to defend you, they will fire you.  That's the state of affairs as it stands.\n\nUpthread you said:\n\n>We should be free to be expressive in our opinions as individuals to a degree without fear of termination by our employers, if by chance the social media spotlight is turned on us as it was with Dan Grilo.\n\nThis is also the current state of affairs.  The degree to which you can express your opinion is the degree to which your employer thinks it's worth it to keep you.  Unless you have an employment contract, that's how at-will employment works in the US.\n\nIf you're arguing that there should be stricter protections for employee speech on social media, what should they be?  If not, are you just second-guessing this employer?\n\n>Liberty Advisor Group, which is where Grilo reportedly worked before the incident, has since issued a statement saying, in part, "Regardless of whether the comments in the tweet were intended to cause the hurt and anger that they ultimately generated, they were unacceptable to us, and the individual who issued the tweet is no longer affiliated with Liberty."\n\nIf you cause hurt and anger to your employer's potential donors/customers/business associates, you're probably gonna have a bad time.

Even if you don't like their religion, skin color, or sexuality.

>The physical pain felt by someone with big muscles being hit isn't lower than the pain felt by someone with small muscles being hit.\n\nI agree that if someone is injuring your body, that's abuse.  It's abuse even if it doesn't cause pain, or if it doesn't injure.\n\nBut it _is_ possible for someone with big muscles to experience less pain from the same physical act (say, a punch in the chest).  Doesn't make it ok.

I think one of the issues here is the difference between "hurt" as in pain, and "hurt" as in damage to the body.  It's entirely possible to be bruised without feeling pain.  This is where the difference in bodies leads to a differing level of "hurt".

Think about a large room with the floor covered in balloons, several layers deep.  If you take a baseball bat (though you'd really need that bat and the balloons to be at a similar scale, so small balloons or a very wide bat) and swing the bat down vertically, you're not going to wind up with a balloon crushed under the bat.  It would hit the balloons and push them sideways out of its way.
I think he'd be replaced in a special election, with an interim replacement appointed by the Gov. of Alabama.  If the vote on DeVos were held before the interim replacement, it would be 50-49.  If they could stall long enough for the replacement/interim senator, they'd be back in the same boat (assuming that replacement would be voting yes).
So flipping through those, I saw this retweet:\n\n>Men think conversation as equal when women speak 15% of the time.

No, he's being called a pedophile apologist because he said that it was good that the relationship happened.  That he's glad it happened because it made him better at blowjobs.  That relationships between young teens and older men can be a good way for boys to learn and grow.
What was he supposed to do at that point?  Taking as a given that he thinks Trump will be a terrible President, was he just supposed to not say anything?  Was he supposed to split the D vote by running third party?

I have a math degree.  $400 Million is more money than most Americans ever imagine the possibility of earning in a year.  If we raise taxes so much that it convinces someone like Warren Buffet to go somewhere else, that will leave an untapped market for someone else to move in on (job creation).  If it doesn't drive the Buffet-like out, then the country gets more in taxes. Either way, America wins.

That was my thought as well.  Oh well, I spent about 10 minutes looking around and then gave up on it.  Kind of baffling why they'd shoot themselves in the foot like that.

Only if you consider logical reasoning 101 "sophisticated."  Burden of proof:  The one making the claim needs to provide evidence for it.  With no evidence, there is zero reason to believe it.  You wouldn't just be swallowing it due to your confirmation bias now, would you?  This is entry level reasoning that you've failed, yet you speak of sophistication.
Okay.  Doesn't invalidate what was said.

If they're going to make it difficult to get via TV streaming devices, then it's their own fault for the drop in ratings.

As far as I've seen, WAPs will have all those legacy data rates enabled by default, so whoever is doing the initial setup should disable everything below 12, and set 12 as the only mandatory.  The only real problem if there are ancient WiFi clients still around.\n\nI've never run into it myself, but why would someone calling the shots, that doesn't understand this, deny disabling those legacy data rates?  Any time I've gone into a place and recommend removing those lower rates, they're all but happy to "get rid of slower speeds."

If a privately owned site removes content, that's their prerogative.  They have no legal obligation to allow anyone to post anything without consequence.  Making a post that declares a group of people as "a bunch of autistics screeching" is hardly any kind of quality political discourse.\n\nIf I had to guess, and this is just a guess, Twitter maybe removed it as a form of demeaning speech against anyone with autism.  Removing what is essentially a dumb shitpost from their own privately run website is hardly news worthy.

This!  In most cases you probably don't need the legacy data rates and should disable them.  All your control frames will use the lowest data rate available.  Lower data rate = more air time = more congestion.  Everything below at least 12 Mb should just be disabled.

No one actually wants or means that when they say free speech.  It would be an anarchy shithole.

Anyone that uses Twitter as a news source for anything other than to report on someone making an opinion is an idiot.
It's dumb to even use it in that capacity.  That's like not confiscating keys to the building, and then later declaring they "picked the locks to break in [with the key,]" and declaring "but we use the term lockpicking very loosely here."

He forgot something important here too:  data rates supported.  Every wifi device I see comes default set to support all the data rates, including all the slowest ones down to 1 Mbps.  All the management and control frames *use the lowest data rate available.*  So what does this mean?  You know how he talks about how even the ssid broadcasts take up air time that everything else has to stop and wait for, right?  All that broadcasts and management traffic will use the slowest available:  1 Mbps.  Guess what that means?  It takes longer, therefore sucking up even more airtime.\n\nIt's hard to find devices that require those lower data rates, so in many cases it's beneficial to disable all data rates below 12 Mbps.  Now your management and control frames take 1/12 as much airtime.

I find it a bit baffling that they seem to be actively working against me giving the "business" (ratings for advertisers) to them.  I put about 10 minutes of effort looking for it, not going to bother any more.  I'll watch it again when it seems like they actually want us to.
The entire premise is much ado about nothing.  I did watch it and it was exactly what I expected; someone conflating the removal of a shitpost as something more than trivial.  Fully within the purview of twitter running their own website.  
That's horrible.  Idiots using it as one doesn't make it any more reliable, accurate, or viable.  140 characters is not enough to do anything other than link to an actual source, much like Wikipedia is not itself a source.
Hell I was reading on the evacuation order for the Oroville Dam (I'm only about 40 mi from it) that was posted on a local news' twitter.

I've heard there's been some libs mudslides, too."\n\nIcing on the cake:  The entire area voted republican.

Except Twitter does have guidelines on what's restricted and is not 100% free.  The XKCD also explicitly references the **right** to free speech.  You have no such right on twitter.

We find out that you first have to log in with info that you have a cable or satellite provider... And that only applies in something like 10 cities.\n\nIf you're going to make it a convoluted mess of random bullshit and misleading info with streaming having a swath of conditions, then they can get bent, we just won't watch it anymore.

Sure, I would have liked to have watched it, but when I couldn't "oh well."

If they not only refuse to get with the times, but are willfully misleading about it, they're only hurting themselves.
This sounds like a challenge.
Don't worry about it, it'Saul Goodman.
Don't be silly.  Just one simple thing.  Like clean out and reorganize the garage.
If I mounted a big enough one on my roof I probably could.  The only things we miss are stuff like the Oscars.  Not worth the money or effort just for something 2 to 3 times a year.

There are no "libel laws [to] open up" the way he was talking about.  As usual, talking out of his ass with no fucking clue what he's talking about. 
I understand that much.  I'm wondering if removing the lower data rates was brought up, and why they'd reject it.  In the end, it is of course their company, and if after being informed they decide (however inappropriately) to leave all the legacy data rates in place, that's their prerogative.
Yes, exactly, due to this kind of bullshit that TM pulls and lost the class action law suit over.  The malicious compliance with that class action is jizz frosting on the shitcake.  They look like even bigger shitheels for doing it this way.
> One side downvotes by 5 votes, the other upvotes by 6 votes. Rinse and repeat.\n\nThe problem with this is they can't possibly match this way due to the fuzzy score.  I find it more likely that Reddit itself is detecting bot votes and applying corresponding upvotes or downvotes to nullify them.  This of course, [throws the ratio way off](https://www.reddit.com/r/BannedFromThe_Donald/comments/5wetfj/t_d_is_about_to_get_themselves_banned_for_blatant/dead2n5/), and becomes so weighted by the sheer volume of bot votes, that it will *always* end up at 51%.  The end users/bot runners do not have the proper precision to offset opposing bot spamming 1:1 (or a slight nudge in the direction they prefer.)  \n\nEven disregarding the lack of precise date to make it happen, wouldn't someone running bots' motivation be to push it the way they want?  If they can blast out hundreds of thousands of votes, why would they stop at just adding a few, instead of trying to stack it in their favor?  With that motivation in mind, it doesn't make sense to try to keep the total points level, because in such a bot war, neither will end up with a percentage they want, it will *always* end up at 51%; one wants it to hit 0, the other would like to see it with a high percentage.  With so many of them ending up with impossible vote counts at 51%, I find it incredibly more probable that the only one with precise information is doing something:  reddit itself.  The point totals stay the same if they counter-vote the bot votes, and it only hits zero if the organic voting pushes it that way, with the bot votes becoming irrelevant for that goal (but also make it next to impossible to climb above 51% as well.) 
They're non-overlapping, so it's fine to run both.  As for the data rates, I'm not sure on most home consumer stuff if you can actually shut off the lower data rates.
My commute to work alone is 40 minutes, one way, in light traffic.  Mine isn't remotely the worst.  Trying to even get mass transit where I'm at, you'd need to cover at minimum a 50 mile radius, and nothing about it would work.  It would be a colossal money sink; there aren't enough people going to the same location to support it.  \n\nSure there are buses trains that you can plan ahead to get to major destinations around here, but that's about it.  Just for fun I've looked up what it takes to use public transportation to get to some places that take me about 45 minutes to drive to.  Some of them it would literally be faster to just walk.

Want to take another stab at it, without lying about what I said, drama queen?\n\nDoes Twitter not have content guidelines?  Was this factually wrong?  Or do you not let a silly thing like facts get in the way of your overblown, melodramatic outrage?
Looking several posts myself, I think this is the most reasonable explanation that fits all the facts.  \n\nFirst, looking at https://www.reddit.com/r/the_donald/about/traffic/ you can see unique visits to t_d averaging about 240k/day (looking at the daily mean on the lefthand side.)  Already impossible to get 400k votes spammed to it before it leaves t_d.\n\nSecond, t_d restricts voting to subscribers, of which there are less than 400k.  Yes you can get around it, but I find it highly unlikely this would make up a significant amount of votes made (unless by bots.)  Of their ~370k subscribers, you can expect a far far lower number of them to actually be active and voting.  I hit up several high point posts in the last 24 hours, and they consistently come back with about 13k votes total made.  So, accounting for people circumventing the "only subs can vote," **less than 3.5%** of T_Ds subscribers are voting on **the most upvoted posts of the day.**  Most are in the 85-90% upvoted range.\n\nNow third, when it gets to r/all, how statistically likely is it that everyone seeing it in all will so nearly perfectly split vote 50/50?  Additionally, it's also very unlikely that through purely organic voting, that t_d threads that do make it to r/all somehow always seem to get to 51% but never go negative.  If reddit counter-votes bot votes 1:1 to nullify upvoting bots, then it all falls together.  The equation is balanced, so it can never go negative.  However, when you add 400,000 to each side of the equation, the ratio is thrown way off.  It won't go negative due to the massive weighting, but the weighting is drowning out the actual votes giving the expected result:  it will get to the point where we see 51%\n\nLike so, in a simplified example:\n\nLet's say our post is 85% upvoted, with 100 votes total being cast.  This post will have 70 points total.\n\n85 upvotes, 15 downvotes\n\nThis is 85% upvoted.\n\nLet's add 400,000 to each side.\n\n400,085 upvotes, 400,015 downvotes.\n\nThe equation is balanced in that each "false" upvote was countered by a downvote.\n\nHowever, the upvote percentage is now... 50.0004%  Reddit will round this ~~up to 51%.~~ down to 50%.  E:  I was wrong, came across a few that Reddit shows 50% while still having a positive point count.  So it probably does normal rounding.  Given the number of votes involved, that leaves a small margin for it to appear as 50% upvotes and have a non-negative point total.
> Twitter has content guidelines, and their content guidelines are anti-freedom of speech. I'm not on twitter, I don't care at all about their content guidelines, but its a fact that they are anti-free speech, you admitted it yourself\n\nNo, I didn't.  You seem to be incapable of constructing an argument that isn't a response to something I never said.  Having some content guidelines isn't "anti-free speech."  \n\nHey, since you consider any site with any content guidelines at all to be "anti-free speech," maybe you can actually point to one that has literally no rules or guidelines that abides by your definition of free speech, and is actually relevant.\n\nE:  Actually, do you actually even have a point relevant to the topic, or you just here to be a semantic troll?
That's amazing since no where does he say he ever supported Trump.
What's wrong with NPR and PBS? 
In order to avoid (though this isn't 100%) being blocked from this subreddit we ask that non-conservatives (on the issue/topic being discussed) be 1.) Respectful 2.) Constructive (not contrarian) 3.) Honest (about your positions).
If you respond to a conservative comment and it turns into a chain of accusations and responses, ask yourself if your purpose to learn and understand better or if you're just trying to poke a hole in the argument.  If it's the latter, you're moving beyond the purpose of dialogue.
Principles are principles.
> If the GOP had any balls\n\nWell, there's your problem.
What's stopping them?  It's a budget issue so they should be able to get it through with 51 votes.
A fund like that its gonna be a long list and the sort of thing the relevant bureaucrats try to keep buried.  So many of these sorts of things get away with it because they stay off the radar, but if they put a big list all in one place it'd draw the kind of scrutiny they do *not* want.
Eh, I suppose. Maybe the Dallas, TX NPR station plays more local content but they seem a little more fair than listening to FOX, MSNBC, or CNN. Just don't think cutting their funding is worth the trouble considering it's a drop in the bucket.
>Just don't think cutting their funding is worth the trouble considering it's a drop in the bucket.\n\nIt's not about the money, it's about not using government money to promote Progressivism. This sends a statement that the government endorses Progressivism.\n\nOf course an Ultimate Conservative would say federal government should not be remotely involved in anything like this, NEA shouldn't exist, etc. due to the constitution, but it's not necessary to go that far to have a problem with  the NPR funding.
Because comparing the military to public media is dumb. But you already know that.
> They've been pretty biased in their coverage **recently**.\n\nOpenly ignoring a ginormous litany of Obama scandals and pushing Leftist talking points and attacking Western capitalism is not recent.\n\nThey're ideologues and should be treated as such.
I have my head in my hands now.  This is more fucked up beyond any belief I had.  Action is necessary, but disappointment is inevitable\n\nTrump's jaw probably hit the ground when he found out how fucked up the Swamp REALLY is
>“Democrats thought it was an attack on Obama,” said Sen. James Lankford, R-Okla., speaking to Fox News. “This is not a Republican or Democrat issue, but one of good government. **Actions settled by the federal government should go back to the federal government, back to the taxpayer.**"\n\nAgreed, thanks for looking out for the taxpayer, Sen. Lankford!\n\nThe only thing that bugs me about this article is they don't include a complete list of organizations benefiting from these funds. Am I just missing it, or is it included? They mentioned a few progressive groups, but who else benefited?
But then they couldn't funnel money to right wing groups when it's their turn.
Try reading the Constitution. Congress has enumerated powers to establish a military. State media outlets, not so much.
I like antiques roadshow, too. But that doesn't mean they should get money from the government. And if they lose their government money, it doesn't mean pbs goes away. They have private donations.
A 20% tariff, which won't happen anyways, won't increase prices that much.\n\n>Goods are crazy cheap in the US now which is something americans cant grasp.  \n\nOf course we grasp this.  That's why we keep it that way with low taxes.
>When big banks are sued by the government for discrimination or mortgage abuse, they can settle the cases by donating to third-party non-victims. The settlements do not specify how these third-party groups could use the windfall.\n\n\nAnyone reminded of the Church's corrupt "Indulgences" program?\n\nThere is also a correlation b/w  bailout money and DNC contributions-- nearly a straight line if graphed, implying a fixed payback%.\n\nGood start. Now:\n\n1. Get rid of NPR and PBS funding, entirely.\n\n2. Stop wasting money on "diversity" and Title IX BS; **and no, that doesn't mean creating new BS with Ivanka.**\n\n3. Treat ADL, ACLU, NAACP and all these supposed "democracy/freedom" groups as the partisan tools they are(even promoting them gets them indirect gov. funding); instead back FIRE\n\n4. **Investigate Obama's quasi-nationalization of the student loan industry, the trillion dollar catastrophe that it is, and payoffs b/w "administrators" and board members in academia and DoE/DNC individuals.**\n\n***********\n\nThere is no limit to how corrupt government can get when the media is lockstep with their ideological bosses. This nation doesn't have a free press but a media wing of the DNC.\n\nObama is the pinnacle of Alinsky's wet dream and it is about time Trump/Bannon destroyed this pervasive, insidious and most sinful monstrosity.
If you want NPR to have people on with Conservative values, then advocate for reinstating the Fairness Doctrine that was killed during Reagan.\n\nThis doctrine allowed people to petition the FCC to have news organizations portray a wide variety of opinions, instead of just one or a few.
If you don't like the ideological slant of public broadcasting, maybe changing their remit to a purely cultural service would be better?
If people want it, it can stand alone and compete in a free market without need for government aid.
Yeah, maybe.    At least once in a while.  I'm not sure how much good these symbolic gestures do, especially an issue that doesn't seem to generate that much public outrage.  Better to have him veto Obamacare repeals.
We don't want or need the Fairness Doctrine.  We want a free market.  What we don't want is government financing of liberal propaganda.   There's no reason for public broadcasting any more.  There are a bazillion ways to get media out there, and they can be as cheap as a lone person with a computer.  We don't need the government to subsidize something that we have more of than we could ever want.
NPR and PBS do mostly a good job on presenting facts, but they usually present one side of the argument much better. For example, when Trump's travel ban was rolled out, they brought in 3 special guests to do an after hours talk. The three guests were 1) an American success story who had come to the US as a refugee, 2) a government "expert" on refugee vetting and 3) an author who had written a book about how refugees are opposed because they show Americans how privileged they are. \n\nNone of that is giving conservatives a fair shake.\n\nAnother tactic NPR uses a lot (I think by accident) is that they take a very divisive subject, like illegal immigration, and bring in an expert. They interview this expert and, surprise, they support the liberal opinion. They will ask in provoking questions, but it is never a hit-job. So the listener comes away believing that this liberal expert speaks for all experts, so liberals must be right, and conservatives are wrong. If this is the person's only source of news, then they will be convinced that the Dems are right in almost every single issue.\n\nWhat NPR does fund which I'm a fan of is IQ2 US debates, which put real experts from both sides of an opinion against each other. This way the audience gets a real, earnest account of each sides argument. 
Nothing.  Legislation is introduced in both Houses.  Point of the article was to make this issue known, which I previously didn't know about.
> Of course an Ultimate Conservative would say federal government should not be remotely involved in anything like this\n\nNo, someone who reads and understands the Constitution would say this.
The US is not a democracy by definition. It is a Republic. 
But if the people want it, isn't that democracy?
If the GOP had any balls they would have forced Obama to to veto this legislation every month since they took the Senate.
I agree mane. His scenario is not only a stretch, I think it is false.
PBS' YouTube channels are pretty on point though. At least with the science and math ones (only ones I watch) they completely steer away from anything remotely political. Maybe they should divert funding to those shows that are actually helping educate people.
So, why don't conservatives advocate for a free market of, say, military spending?
Not if they aren't opening their own pockets to finance it.\n\nOtherwise they're just voting to have government compel it.
Also, if people want public broadcasting, isn't that the free market demanding it?
Nah, I prefer the First Amendment.
Then how do we know about the groups listed in the article? How many groups total were there? How much did the 3 left-leaning organizations get from this fund? What portion of the total fund went to left-leaning organizations?\n\nMore details and more transparency would be great.
They've been pretty biased in their coverage recently. Trashing Trump, republicans and avoiding the dirt on democrats.\n\nI don't think we should defund them though. My grandmother needs her Antic Roadshow. 
Thank you for attempting to answer my question, and for the source.  It is a dense read, but I'll look through it. 
That is fairly shocking.  But I think you could say that of any President in their first month.  Most don't make it.  Let's hope Trump does.  Or whoever is after him.
If he's good enough, someone will take him.  But teams may pass him over, not wanting the controversy.  Which would cost him.
No.  The whole reason Democrats want the tax return, is so they can go through a fine tooth comb and twist every possible item they can, in order to rake him over the coals, as they did over the 3 pages of leaked 1995 tax returns.  Oh no, he took a completely legal and standard deduction, the net operating loss!  He hasn't paid any taxes ever!\n\nAnd everyone know releasing the full tax returns, some 1200 pages a year would not put anything to rest.  They would just use it as a bludgeon to beat him with.
>only until the secretary of State certifies that the Palestinian Authority has taken steps “to end acts of violence” against U.S. and Israeli citizens\n\nOK, good.  So it's cut off forever.
And thanks.\n\nYeah, it's not really a subreddit (I'm guessing) to have a sophisticated debate about the issues, which I knew.  It's more a subreddit to pop in, post "Traitor! KGB! Lock him up!", and move on to the next story.\n\nBut I foolishly plod on, because for some reason a response of "Hey, good point" is like crack to me.
You're seriously linking a Reddit post as proof?  And once again, your reference supports my argument:\n\n> NYHETERtis July 28, 2015 Malmo shaken by a series of grenade attacks and shootings. Despite the cut in half the police force in the city during the summer. - It's only a matter of time before someone in the public will be harmed, says union president Sophia Will Anderson to Sydsvenskan. In recent weeks, six grenade attacks occurred in Malmo. In summer the city has also been plagued by 30 shootouts. But despite the violence has Malmö's police force has been halved.\n\nThis is Malmo, Sweden.  With strict gun laws.  Immigrant areas.  In the news for shootouts and grenade attacks **in Sweden**.  Why are you so insistent on bringing this to our shores?\n\nThe director of the FBI says this can't be safely done.  And all you have: "You're a coward, you're racist".  So bush league.
Whoa, whoa, calm down, buddy.  We're not scared of any of that.  We just don't want Mexican rapists and killers, or refugee rapists and killers in the U.S.  what do you have to say the victims of illegal  immigrants and refugees, like the 1200 German women sexually assaulted and/or raped in one night in New Year's Eve?  "Look how brave we are!  Sorry you got raped and all, but you know, we don't want to act scared.  I mean, statistically speaking, you were more likely to be raped by an American!". Very comforting.
I said inadequately vetted.  Like the ones in Sweden and Germany.  Which is now why Sweden is now known for gang rape, riots, and explosive devices in civilian settings.   And Jewish Swedes having to move from their home towns.  Why do you want to bring this here? \n\nAlso from your source:\n\n>FBI Director James Comey testified last year that screening Syrians is particularly challenging, and that he can’t guarantee there is no risk involved.\n\nSo I guess he's just a coward as well.
I don't think that's possible.  The President nominates, congress approves.  She doesn't get a say in who gets her seat.  Now, if she was 50, I guess she could make a deal with the president, but she's way old.  He would just wait her out.
No, not really.  Obviously, calling them death panels and saying they were going to judge people's worth is political grandstanding, but what is being referred to is [Independent Payment Advisory Board](http://www.modernhealthcare.com/article/20161201/NEWS/161139993), a non elected group charged with controlling Medicare's costs.  They could decide, for example, that a new cancer drug that only affects a hundred people a year is too expensive, and decline to cover it.\n\nNow, this has not happened, but is well within their designated power, and appears to be specifically designed to shield Congress from the political effects of these decisions.\n\nIt is not clear to me why Palin and her spokesperson point to the part of the bill about end of life counseling, but the IPAB is given that power, despite including that they would not allow rationing.\n\nAnd it's why, there have been several bipartisan efforts to repeal this part.\n\nHistrionic, maybe, but not a lie.
Not very helpful, when he is searching for answers.  Jesus was crucified so we all would be saved.
You addressed none of that.  And it was rhetorical, really, to make this kind of argument look silly.
Not perfect.  Adequate.  It can't be done.  You have nothing to say.
Yes.  I think this is the justification.\n\n>It is known that the Russians were actively attempting to influence the election at the time.\n\nYes.  But that does not mean that Trump was colluding with them.  I think the wiretap was reasonable.  I also think we would have heard about this if collusion was found.\n\nOnce a lot of info was gathered, I think the government is in a very precarious position to stop gathering Intel from a political opponent, and use only that info that is relevant to the case at hand, or criminal in nature.\n\nI think we are entering a very dark place when the intelligence community can target the president's political opponent and only needs approval from a court that approves about 99% of requests, and then can continue monitoring for 'security reasons'.\n\nI hope everybody did the right thing for the right reasons, and that all the details come out in the end.  I realize this is naive of me.\n\nAlso, food for thought, Trump has this same power now.
I only watched the part you mentioned, starting about 5:45, for 30 seconds or so.  It appears to me there were a lot of people there, groaning, being disruptive, and acting like a bunch of children.  And I seriously doubt all those people read the 11k pages of the affordable care act.
You mean with an intelligent designer.
>Do they really need that? I mean all you need to "rake Trump over the coals" is just put him in front of a camera and a microphone and ask him to speak. He's the American Rob Ford.\n\nMaybe.  But that may or may not be a winning strategy.  3 years is a long time, he may realize that angry tweets and catch phrases won't make him a good President.  Like how GWB learned to speak more clearly, and stop adding extras syllables to his words (they misunderestimated his strategery).  The charge still went out he was an idiot, but the point didn't quite hit home like before.\n\n>ironically, the least incriminating thing about him. He's just using the law as it has been given to him. He'd be stupid not to take those deductions. I mean I guess at worst it maybe shows he's not an altruistic "man of the people", but people should have known that just from everything else he's said and done.\n\nMaybe to you and me.  But Hillary made a lot of hay out of this.  He doesn't pay taxes!! He doesn't support schools!  That's with 3 pages.  He would get tons of bad press, for following perfectly legal and reasonable deductions.\n\n>But when the guy says "I will release my tax returns if Obama releases his birth certificate", and then doesn't...\n\nI think that's fair game.  He should be held accountable for broken promises, hypocrisy, etc. (I think he said he'd release his taxes when Hillary released her medical record, etc)\n\n>[promises to release deductions] and doesn't, you have to ask, why?\n\nAgain, valid point.  However, he's clearly done the political math, and decided it's less political risk than releasing his taxes.  This could be there is something really bad that's in there (although, the IRS I'm sure looks through it with a fine tooth comb, so it can't be too obvious or illegal), or, it's completely on the up and up, and he feels like I do, that there's no benefit to be gained from this.\n\nI think everyone's (mine included) perceptions of Trump will make them draw their own conclusions.\n\n>he's afraid people will find out he's not as rich as they think he is? Maybe he'd rather have his net worth as some mysterious floating rounded number than pinpointed to an exact value?\n\nI'm thinking this is likely true, and most people probably believe it.  He claims $10 billion, Forbes says $4.  But not a reason to force him to release his taxes.  \n\n>Maybe he's afraid he's really shitty at hiding corruption in his taxes?\n\nI know this was probably funny, but unlikely.  I'm sure he has the best tax preparers that money can buy.\n\n\nAnd look, in theory, I agree with you.  I think the President should be as transparent as possible, and should give his money to a true blind trust to manage so there is no possibility of conflicts of interest.\n\nHowever, I think his privacy (again, in theory) should be maintained.  I'd be fine with a congressional panel looking at his taxes if it wouldn't be leaked.  And it's not like there's going to be a line saying 'illegal Russian donations'.  Besides, he's wouldn't be tempted by money (unless it's in the $100 millions to billions), if he was going to collude (which I don't think he did), it would be for power and campaign assistance which would not show up on his tax records.\n\nAnd take Trump out of the equation.  You have a billionaire, think Steve Jobs, Bill Gates, Warren Buffett.  Is it fair that he has to be out of his business for 4 or 8 years?  It's one thing to have someone else run it, but it's not like you can really hide what Trump towers, Apple, or Microsoft is doing.  It's not ever going to be a truly blind trust.  I don't know if any of those people, or other super rich by those standards would ever run, but it doesn't seem like they should be shunned by excessive demands because of their wealth.
I saw that part.  It seems unlikely he made it up entirely, probably twisted something around.  I would have been curious the follow up.  \n\nAnd I agree, but again I think there are no winners here at all.
This is so important, especially considering [thing Trump said about Bush:](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/02/13/in-2008-donald-trump-said-george-w-bush-shouldve-been-impeached/?utm_term=.ee23c30589d5)\n\n>"When [Pelosi] first got in and was named speaker," Trump said to Blitzer then, "I met her. And I'm very impressed by her. I think she's a very impressive person, I like her a lot."\n\n>"But I was surprised that she didn't do more in terms of Bush and going after Bush," he continued. "It just seemed like she was really going to look to impeach Bush and get him out of office. Which personally I think would have been a wonderful thing."\n\n>Blitzer interjected: "To impeach him?"\n\n>"For the war," Trump replied. "For the war! Well, he lied! He got us into the war with lies!"\n\n>Remarkably, Trump then went on to compare Bush unfavorably with Bill Clinton. "I mean, look at the trouble Bill Clinton got into with something that was totally unimportant," Trump said, referring to the Monica Lewinsky investigation. "And they tried to impeach him, which was nonsense. And yet Bush got us into this horrible war with lies, by lying. By saying they had WMDs, by saying all sorts of things that happened not to be true."\n\nThere is nothing to be gained by infighting with Republicans.  Trump won the party from the Bushes, nothing to fight over.  It's time to use that energy to move Trump's agenda forward, not to alienate Republicans.
Yes.  Because unlike other countries, we haven't let in 100,000's of inadequately vetted refugees.  So you agree with me.\n\nBut hey, if someone can identify the right wing terrorists and lock them up, I'm all for that, too.
No, not what I'm saying.  For that single person, it's the same thing.  But, for Blue Cross, for a made up example, if a large corporation with 1,000 employees hears that it is denying coverage for a costly drug for the daughter of one of their employees, they can threaten to move the whole company to another insurer.  If word gets out Blue Cross does this a lot, they will likely lose business to their competitors.\n\nIf Medicare says a drug is too costly for the small number of people affected, that's sort of it.  You can call the newspaper, right your congressman, which may be successful, but there's nothing else to do.  Move to Canada, maybe, and hope they cover it.
I've yet to find unbiased sources, as the topic is so polarizing, but facts are facts.  If you've found any more neutral figures, u would like to look at them.
Prayer is never a waste of time.  Anyhow, it's my time, and I consider it well spent
>and more than that are trying to leave. \n\nWe should let them leave then.\n\n\n>No, but when we take into account the fact that more people are leaving, how does one justify getting into a trade war or fronting the money ourselves to get a wall built to stop a trend isn't a problem?\n\nIt is a problem.  The numbers will rise and fall based on many factors.  They started to regress because our economy went into a recession.  But before the election, they started [coming back](http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2016/11/03/illegal-immigrants-surging-to-us-mexico-border-in-race-against-election-day.html) before the election.   When our economy booms, and theirs falters, they'll be back.  Which is fine, but they need to come legally so we can do background checks to keep out any criminals.\n\n\n>> Amnesty was done already in the 1980's for 3 million people, and the result is today's problem of 12 million illegal immigrants.\n\n>That is incorrect. Until we militarized the borders the majority of undocumented workers cam here seasonally and left. The reason they stayed was conservative policy that made the prospect of leaving too daunting. \n\nIt is correct, as you can easily verify.  So your idea is to leave the borders open, and let people come and go as they please, with no limits?  Does that seem rational to you?\n\nAnd it is very clear that amnesty brings people in by the millions.  Which is why when Obama said he would not deport unaccompanied minors, unaccompanied minors across the border exploded.  Plus, most don't want to become citizens.  They are proud Mexicans, they want to come, work, make enough money to support their family, and go back home.\n\n>We already have the most militarized border on earth, and analysis shows it's had the opposite effect of encouraging people to stay and leading to a higher population of undocumented people in the US. \n\nWhat?  What analysis?  This is absurd.  Sure, the more difficult the cross, the less people will want to leave, but if the border is secure, they won't be able to cross at all.  \n\n And most militarized border on earth is laughably incorrect.  The Israel West Bank wall?  North and South Korea?   Pakistan India?  The US border is dangerous, due to deserts and drug cartels, but hardly the most militarized.\n\n>>expel all the violent and dangerous illegal immigrants.\n\n>wants to criminalize people *for being here illegally*, which is not a criminal offense. The primary issue is an aging group that needs a pathway to citizenship before they age out of the labor pool and become an actual burden.  \n\nHow is being here illegally not a criminal offense?  Again, this is absurd.  They are by definition law breakers.\n\nAnd, for all the hand wringing and blustering, the number of deportations under Trump is down compared to Obama.  There has been no effort to deport those whose only offense is crossing the border.  That may change, but currently it's not happening.
Hey!  I broke through!  I had long thought you were a troll.  And I don't know about more thoughtful, apparently just more stubborn.\n\nI appreciate your argument.  It's one thing to try and ban or arrest people who are here, with full constitutional rights.  Almost all murders are committed by men.  We can't lock up all men, even though clearly murders, rape, etc, would drop by 80% or so.  It's another thing to voluntary admit people who may be coming to cause harm.\n\nAnd it's hard to follow statistics, as governments appear to be actively suppressing reports and not collecting statistics to determine the real rate of crimes by immigrants.  Like Sweden does, no longer collecting citizen status on crimes.\n\nEven your report, which shows immigrants are less likely to commit crimes than Germans:\n\n>Government data show that despite a 440 percent increase in migrants, crime among that group only increased by 79 percent last year.\n\n>Nonetheless, in terms of raw numbers, that's 92,000 more crimes committed by migrants than in previous years.\n\n>Instances of assaults, robberies and "predatory extortion," a classification that includes threatening behavior, doubled over 2015. \n\n>Smaller offenses, such as theft (mostly shoplifting), forging paperwork to get money and riding on public transport without paying the fare, nearly doubled.\n\n> Fewer than 1 percent, or less than 1,000, are sex crimes, in spite of social media rumors.\n\nSo percentage-wise, not that bad.  But, 92,000 more crimes (not total crimes), which means 92,000 more victims.   "Only 1,000 sex crimes."  I'm sure most crimes, regardless of who committed them are underreported, especially rape.\n\nBut that means 1000 women who will be assaulted, who otherwise wouldn't per year.  I think we owe something to them, too.\n\nI'm not sure of our actual obligation, but I think we should do everything in our power to help those affected.  Most don't need or necessarily even want to come to the US or Europe, they just want to be safe, and keep their family safe.  And it seems most of the problems (as everywhere), are caused by young, unemployed single men who are not especially motivated to integrate into their adopted culture, and appear more interested in turning Europe into a Muslim state.\n\nSo I think:  1) Re-evaluate the vetting system with recommendations from intelligence agencies.  It will never be perfect, but make it as good as possible.  2)  Create true safe spaces in the middle east, which is closer to their home, cheaper, and more in line with their cultures. This is the biggest priority, especially from a better educated group such as the Syrians 3)  For those who can't fit into #2, prioritize complete families, women, and children, and be very cautious with unaccompanied males of fighting age.  (It seems the US has done this more than Europe).  Inform them they will have to integrate into Western ideals and cultures (ie, women are equal to men and Americans can dress as they like), homosexuals are people and can't be attacked, etc.  4)  Have a low threshhold to remove those who don't comply with US rules.
That's a pretty good list, thanks.  I'll check them out.
LMAO!
>think about whether the immigrants they want to see deported are a danger to the nation or not, if deporting them will be useful in any way at all, and if those immigration policies are Christian or not. I certainly think that most stances on immigration can be supported by Christianity. \n\nIs this your opinion, or is this biblically based?  I agree, sending them off to death camps is one thing, enforcing current law is another.\n\nWhat you say seems counter to Romans 13, v.5 of which says "Therefore one must be in subjection [of the government], not only to avoid God's wrath but also for the sake of conscience".\n\nAnd those were fairly bad governments they were in at the time.
He didn't get to finish his statement.  I'm not sure what he was saying.  Certainly no one is appearing before the board.\n\nRegardless, this post was about whether representatives should stay in hostile townhalls.  No need to get sidetracked on this issue.
It sure is.  And, unfortunately we're the victims.  People can hardly make any point without someone screaming nazi, or death panels at them.   And I don't see it get any better, and the majority (I'm still hoping) gets turned off and shut out in the process.  \n\nAt least on Reddit you can usually wade through the crap to discuss things civilly.  In some subreddits, like this.  Thank you for your discussion.
Good thing for him Hillary has proven lying under oath has no consequences.\n\nUntil she is punished, you have no leg to stand on. 
Illegal immigrants, by definition, have broken the law.  This discussion is about whether biblically we have the right to ignore laws specifically because we disagree with them, as we are called to obey the government.\n\nAnd you have no idea about my empathy, so you shouldn't be too quick to judge.
No.  The government that can tell you how much money you are allowed to make is not going to set the limit at $10 million.  Or $1 million.  Or probably $100,000.\n\nYou are free to go to those countries that severely confiscate from the rich to help the poor, with the government controlling the economy.  Cuba, Venezuela, North Korea, probably Russia at some point.  A paradise on earth.\n\nAnd, in the US, the 1% can't take anything from anybody.  They have to provide goods or services that people want to buy.  Only the government can take your money.
Great.  No hyperbole.  Sounds like he's going to have a very unimportant life then.
Quit talking about not vetting.  We're talking about inadequate vetting.\n\nAgain, from your source:\n>To be sure, there are valid concerns about the Syrian refugee vetting process. **FBI Director Comey testified Oct. 22, 2015, before the House Judiciary Committee that “I can’t sit here and offer anybody an absolute assurance that there’s no risk associated with this.”**\n\n>Comey went into more detail in his Oct. 21 testimony before the House Homeland Security Committee. He said screening procedures had improved from earlier years, but that U.S. databases have **less information on Syrian terrorists**\n\nAgain, nothing of interest to say.
No, just the ones committing crimes.  \n\nLike I said, if you ever want a grown up conversation, let me know.
You can do approximately twice as much with $20 million than you could with $10 million.
I'm not sure what is vague.  You were comparing illegal immigrants to escaped slaves, which conjures up the evils of slavery on innocent people.\n\nI think a better comparison is a petty criminal, say a shoplifter, hiding from the law.
No, I think you misunderstand what argument I'm making.  During the Holocaust, I think it's easy to say sending innocent people to their death is wrong, and we are called to resist.\n\nThe illegal immigration laws, which are to punish those who break our laws by sending them back to their home country is something entirely different.  If they were to be executed by the US, or their home country, that is one thing, but that's not the case.\n\nAnd I understand the idea of resisting all laws you don't agree with,  but my question is that biblically based, considering say Romans 13:5, \n\n> 5 So you must obey the government, not just because you might be punished, but because you know it is the right thing to do.\n\nThis can't just mean when we think the government is doing the right thing, there would be no need for a verse like that.
It should have been punished at the time, but previous administrations decided they had no duty to follow the law.  This administration is following the law, so as he is here illegally and has a criminal history, he is qualified to be deported.\n\nI am sorry that the rules for staying in this country illegally are too stringent.  How many laws should the be able to break?  5?  10?  Actually kill someone when they're driving drunk?
Any time.  Good talking to you.
>The chance of someone treated regretting it is significantly lower than the chance of someone *not* treated committing suicide. So...yeah. It's a no-brainer\n\nDo you have sources for these statements?  I've not seen these claims anywhere else. 
Well, the whole post is literally calling congressmen 'shitweasels', because they are not forcing him to release his taxes against his will.\n\nAnd I agree with you, a billionaire with multinational interests should be transparent with his holdings.\n\nHowever, having watched how congressional Democrats dragged Tom Price's name through the mud after his full disclosures of completely above the board financial transactions that was in no way insider or privileged trading, it's understandable he wouldn't.  And I don't blame him.\n\nAnd yes, I acknowledge Republicans do the same thing whenever they can, like saying Ruth Bader Ginsburg endorses lowering the age of consent to 12.
Yes, I understand the tiring aspect of the arguing.  Stepping away from Reddit is both a sacrifice and probably a good idea.\n\nAnd let's not get sidetracked.  I don't  really care what you think of me, obviously.  I admit I may have over reacted, but I think attacking someone's empathy instead of talking about the issue tends to stifle debate.  No need to respond to this part.\n\nMy question, which I'm still not sure you answered, at what level crime do you feel that passage refers to?\n\nWe all agree, shooting Christians in the head, bad.  You can go against the government. Parking ticket, submit to the authorities.  Punishment for myself, regardless of law broken, submit to authority, unless maybe penalty is death.  \n\nThe part that's harder for me, is like illegal immigrants.  We can all support their intentions, and help them all we can before and after.  We can work within the system to change the laws, etc.\n\nThe question isn't if people need help.  They do, and we should help them.   The question is when does that passage apply?   I don't think just because we feel the people need help.  The passage seems straightforward to me.  We should submit to the authorities, regardless of how we feel about those involved.\n\nDo you have any thoughts on this situation?  Or do you just ignore that passage
Yes.  It's the same process, and they do it frequently. Although, not that it's easy, if insurance company does that too often, people will leave that company to a different one.  With Medicare, there's no other Medicare to go to.
She should be so proud she was finally able to stand up to someone *holding the door* for her, with only a few hours of shaking.  But seems satirical.  
> How is "has to talk to the media and be on camera" a higher standard than "has to hand over tax returns to get the job"? Celebrities have to earn popularity in the national spotlight, I'd like to think we hold our elected officials to a higher standard than them, too.\n\nWe require more from Presidential candidates than celebrities.  Adam Sandler is very funny and popular, but if you compare him to Democratic candidates in 2020, he probably wouldn't score that high.  Now, if he wanted to run as a candidate, he would be required to attend debates, answer questions, etc, then be judged on his answers.\n\nAnd, "talking" is a high standard, plus one's experience.  All a lawyer does is "talk" to a jury.  Most doctors just "talk" to their patients to figure out what's wrong, then run a few tests.  Job interviews are just "talking" to a boss.  But that makes or breaks the hire.\n\nHanding of tax returns is #10 or so, in my opinion.  If you think it's higher, vote against them.\n\n\n> I'd say the concerns about corruption, cronyism and ties to Russia are about as big as it gets, and many of those concerns can either be relieved or proven with tax returns.\n\nYes.  But this isn't why Democrats want the tax returns.  They want all the information contained so they can use it to bludgeon him over the head for the next 8 years.  Oh look, a completely legal deduction!  Lets run multiple stories how he doesn't take taxes and hates schools!  \n\nAnd there is literally no evidence that has been presented of any collusion between the Trump campaign and the Russians about the election.  And there is non stop coverage.  Showing his taxes will do nothing to put that to rest.  It's not like there would be anything related to Russia even if he was getting paid by them anyhow.  It would be laundered through some other way.\n\n> What?! You're saying we shouldn't bother demanding it because it will just get leaked anyway?\n\nI'm saying the point of getting the tax returns is to leak them to the public for political advantage of the Democrats.\n\n> You're saying that forcing people to reveal their tax info will only keep out the good people, leaving only the bad people?\n\nI'm saying, running for President is an unpleasant process.  Would you want to do it?  Donald Trump has had many successes in his life, whatever you think of him.  Now every day I read how people think he can't read, he's stupid, he's lost control, he's a puppet of Bannon, his name is Mud, his family is verbally attacked by random strangers, he's been called racist, homophobic, anti-Muslim, etc.  What normal person wants to go through that. And the more barriers you add, like lack of privacy, will turn more and more people off.  Next there will be calls to turn over all your emails, your contact list.  And less and less people will want to take part.
This would be great news.
 From Wikipedia, [Article titled New Year's Eve sexual assaults in Germany](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Year's_Eve_sexual_assaults_in_Germany):\n\n> On 9 April, these numbers had risen to 1,754 crimes, with 1,455 victims living in all four cities. \n\n>In addition, similar assaults in Austria, Finland, Switzerland, and Sweden were reported\n\nThese are only sexual assaults and or raped, total crimes like mugging were higher.\n\nAgain, I know you have no sympathy for the raped victims, but what if it was your daughter, sister, mother?  Attacked because dangerous people let in unnecessarily.  "Yes, but at least we're soooo brave!  Sorry about the rape."\n\nSo, anything to respond?  More name calling?  Come back if you ever want to have a grown up conversation.
There is no obligation for a representative to be yelled at by a group of people during any meeting.  The people can have their concerns heard, but a loud group of protesters can dominate the hall, prohibiting any other citizens from talking, and making it impossible for the representative to answer questions.\n\nIf they want to voice their passionate disagreement, fine, they can.  If they want to yell, jeer, disrupt, present information from being discussed, then it is impossible to have any sort of discussion.  They protested the pledge for God's sake?\n\nIf I was the representative, heard people loudly protest the opening prayer, protest the pledge, and start to yell and jeer, I would end the townhall right then, thank them all for coming, and tell them to email their concerns to my office.
My view, is the biblical teaching that we must obey the government, as in Romans 13;\n\n>5 So you must obey the government, not just because you might be punished, but because you know it is the right thing to do.\n\nThis obviously applies only to laws we disagree with, otherwise there's no need of a verse.  Executing innocent people is one extreme, and opposing it is the right thing.  Enforcement of immigration laws, with sending people back to their home country is more ambiguous, and I worry one is not on solid biblical footing here, just because you disagree with the laws.
I agree it's awful, but it's not unprovoked, with major media outlets openly leaning towards Hillary.  It would be great if media outlets of all stripes would give us straightforward news and analysis without pushing towards a particular bias.\n\nBut, the media is made of people, and people feel strongly about such things.\n\nAnd one thing that seems universal, is people are fairly willing to believe almost anything about someone they strongly disagree with.
Uh huh.  Good luck with this.
Well, biblically speaking, Christians are called to obey the government:\n\n 5 So you must obey the government, not just because you might be punished, but because you know it is the right thing to do.\n\nThis verse must only exist for cases in which we disagree with the government, there's no need for a verse otherwise, or it would be clear in the text.\n\n"Punishing the innocents" is one thing, but in this case the government is enforcing the law, which illegal immigrant have, by definition, have broken.  I think if the plan is to execute them, you certainly would resist that.  But if it's to spend a night in jail, or be sent back to their home country, that's a much different matter.\n\nNow anyone is welcome to ignore laws you disagree with, but I don't think that is a biblical view.
Prideful to a fault is one thing, you're talking about committing suicide.  Once we secure the border, these tactics won't work.  And anyone that comes in will be dumped back in to Mexico.\n\nBut, there's nothing to worry about.  This is just political negotiations over the cost of the wall.  There will be no trade or any other kind of war, or other types of tariffs.  It is far better for everyone to keep trade open, which is what will happen.\n\nWe have our differences, but it is in all our best interests for our nations to be strong allies.

That is true, in a way.  But I think it is very likely Democrats would use perfectly legal, reasonable findings on the tax returns as political weapons.  For example the deductions found on 3 pages of his 1995 taxes, which Hillary Clinton then used in the debate to say he probably doesn't pay taxes, and doesn't support schools or military because he doesn't pay taxes.  Which is completely ridiculous, but scores political points.\n\nLike the whole Russian collusion during the campaign.  There is zero evidence of collusion that has been presented (doesn't mean it didn't happen, I know).  But articles are in the news all day every day implying that is the case.  Now imagine 1200 pages of taxes, x 5 years (or whatever) of true information.  It would never stop.
FSU football, venomous snakes of the southeast, and politics.
The truth is that the national debt is down $12 billion his first month, and no one wrote about.  Just like Trump said.
This is no time to purge non-believers.  Without the RINO's, we wouldn't hold a majority in either House, and Trump would get nothing but opposition.  Lets keep control the government, get the agenda going as best we can, then worry about converting or purging the non-purists.
Sorry for the late response, but work was a factor.  Thank you for taking the time to respond.\n>As far as your empathy - I do have an idea about it. You are providing me, and everyone else a glimpse into it. And, to be honest, it seems very shallow.\n\nHmm.  I see.  Well, did you know Jesus called some people a brood of vipers?  And sinners?  Paul said in Romans 1, \n>They have become filled with every kind of wickedness, evil, greed and depravity. They are full of envy, murder, strife, deceit and malice. They are gossips, 30slanderers, God-haters, insolent, arrogant and boastful; they invent ways of doing evil; they disobey their parents; 31they have no understanding, no fidelity, no love, no mercy. 32Although they know God’s righteous decree that **those who do such things deserve death**\n\nI guess you'll want to have a word with those two about their lack of empathy.  Oh, you mean Jesus was speaking to selfish religious leaders, trying to save people from their sin?  And was actually the most compassionate person to ever walk the earth?  Similar from Paul?  I guess it's almost like you can't judge a person based on what they said in one sentence, especially when you didn't seem to follow the points of the discussion.  Maybe I support a facility that helps single, unwed pregnant girls.  Maybe I volunteer at a homeless clinic that treats illegal aliens for free.  Maybe I organize dog fights for money.  I reiterate, it is hard to judge a person's empathy by a few statements on a specific topic on an internet post.\n\nThe poster was wondering if attitudes changed by calling illegal immigrants "runaway slaves".  In that same vein, with that set up, I was wondering if calling them "petty criminals" changes the answer as well.  I think you could argue either way.\n\nI'm assuming you just saw "petty criminals", based your opinion on that, which is reasonable.\n\nIn any case, I would appreciate you answering the original question, which you haven't really.\n\n>Jews were, by definition, criminals. Runaway slaves were, by definition, criminals. Ghandi was, by definition, a criminal. MLK was, by definition, a criminal. Christ was, by definition, a criminal. \nNeed I go on? \n\nYes, because this isn't really relevant to the issue at hand.  And being a criminal doesn't mean they're right.  Charles Manson is a criminal.  Ted Bundy is a criminal.\n\n> assume you agree that we get to disobey the laws which called the aforementioned "criminals." I assume you agree that disobeying hose laws is "biblical." (I would use the word moral, but ... meh.)\n\nI think this is the heart of the issue.  I would agree, yes, it would be very easy if the bible said ignore those laws that are immoral.  That fits with my world view, and would help me sleep better.  And, I'm asking a biblical question, not what I think or agree.  The principle is summarized in Romans 13:\n\n>13 Let every person be subject to the governing authorities. For there is no authority except from God, and those that exist have been instituted by God. 2 Therefore whoever resists the authorities resists what God has appointed, and those who resist will incur judgment. 3 For rulers are not a terror to good conduct, but to bad. Would you have no fear of the one who is in authority? Then do what is good, and you will receive his approval, 4 for he is God's servant for your good. But if you do wrong, be afraid, for he does not bear the sword in vain. For he is the servant of God, an avenger who carries out God's wrath on the wrongdoer. 5 Therefore one must be in subjection, not only to avoid God's wrath but also for the sake of conscience. 6 For because of this you also pay taxes, for the authorities are ministers of God, attending to this very thing. 7 Pay to all what is owed to them: taxes to whom taxes are owed, revenue to whom revenue is owed, respect to whom respect is owed, honor to whom honor is owed.\n\nHow do you reconcile that with your statement:\n\n> when can we do this? But that is another thing altogether\n\nNo, that is the discussion we're having here.  What kind of offense can I not subject myself to the governing authorities?  Why is that passage there?  I can't believe it's about taxes and parking tickets (although that clearly is included).  There really isn't much of a need for a single statement, much less the whole passage for that.\n\nAnd the case of Christ is an interesting point.  If you were there at the time, any of us, like Peter would have tried to assist Jesus, or help him escape the Romans, etc., which clearly would have gone against God's plan (not that Jesus would have escaped, as he showed).  So, as the passage states, sometime governments doing things that appear evil to us at the time are being used for his purpose.\n\nSo, I guess my question boils down to this:  How do we act, knowing that passage is in the Bible, and per my belief, is the word of God?\n\nOption 1:  Assume it only means like taxes, and speed limits, and doesn't really apply to laws involving people and moral issues (this seems to be what you favor).  An example maybe, would be to help a starving father who has stolen food for his family evade police capture.  Certainly you'd help the family in the future, but what do you do about the police?\n\nOption 2:  more or less ignore the passage, similar to #1.\n\nThose options, while appealing, seem to downplay the passage.  I feel there is some line, as hinted at above, that suggest above this line, you are free to not subject yourself to the authorities.  I'm just having trouble drawing this line.  To me, personally, I think I should accept punishments given to me.  But for others, it's a bit blurrier.  But, I feel that line as drawn by that passage is higher than being discussed here.\n\nIf you have any thoughts on this matter, I would enjoy hearing them.
You mean director Comey's opinion?  Yet nothing you can list.\n\nBut, don't bother.  You have nothing of interest to say in this matter.  
You don't need an argument for a wall, all walls do the same thing.  A wall can be built that can stop virtually all illegal crossings.  It won't help with people who overstay visas or those who are already here, but at least when we deport criminals, like the illegal alien that just killed his child's mother and kidnapped the child, they won't be able to come back in.\n\nOh, and if you're going to argue something about a brick wall or a 31 foot ladder, don't bother, because I'll know you haven't ever put any thought into the issue.
>"There is a provision in there that anyone over the age of 74, has to go before, what is effectively, a death panel... Yes they do!! Yes they do!! It's in there, folks.  You're wrong!! Okay children, alright children changed the meaning?\n>... Just kidding, that's a bunch of crap"\n\n>That's the only way he could possibly finish it without lying through his teeth.  I'm all for getting back to the initial question, but do you at least concede that 1) he lied, and 2) he called the constituents children? \n\nI think what he actually said is definitely not true, although I've not read the ACA text in its entirety.  I can think of nothing that would be in there to justify this.  However, you must concede that the constituents drowned him out, so you have no idea what he was going to say.\n\n2). Never denied this.  He lost his cool, which generally means you lose the debate.\n\nBut you must concede groaning, jeering and shouting people down so they can't speak is childish, and most of those people were unlikely to have read the entire 11,000 pages of the ACA.  
He is correct.  And like Rush said, why are we on the defensive?  Republicans hold the White House, both chambers of Congress, and soon the Supreme Court.  Trust in the media is at an all time low.\n\nIgnore this ridiculous Russian collusion theory with no evidence, and undo all the last minute changes Obama made.  I'm not sure what Obama could be charged with now, even though this seems bigger than the Watergate break in, as it's not clear he went over his power as president, even though he clearly abused them.
Right.  Hence the raping and exploding things in Europe.  And back to name calling.\n\nWhy are you still doing this?  You obviously have nothing to say about this other then name calling and repeating your meritless arguments.  Are you just seeing how long before I quit replying?
No, you were clear, I appreciate your response.\n\nI feel our secular governments are frequently not just, as you put it.  I know we should not do anything that puts us at odds with God's law, but I think it's slippery ground if we start using our own criteria about subverting the authority of government over laws we may disagree with but that don't cause is to violate God's law.
I'm not sure your reference is any less disputed than mine.  The US Chamber of commerce is notably pro immigrant and pro-cheap labor.\n\n>these benefits as an investment for the future, when these children become workers and taxpayers. \n\nInvestment sounds like it's costing money.  And this reference talks about taxes paid in, but conspicuously does not mention outlays for healthcare, education, etc., except for one study in Arizona.\n\nHere is an equally biased report, but they give the actual accounting in their report:\n\n>    Illegal immigration costs U.S. taxpayers about $113 billion a year at the federal, state and local level. The bulk of the costs — some $84 billion — are absorbed by state and local governments.\n    \n>* The annual outlay that illegal aliens cost U.S. taxpayers is an average amount per native-headed household of $1,117. The fiscal impact per household varies considerably because the greatest share of the burden falls on state and local taxpayers whose burden depends on the size of the illegal alien population in that locality\n    \n>* Education for the children of illegal aliens constitutes the single largest cost to taxpayers, at an annual price tag of nearly $52 billion. Nearly all of those costs are absorbed by state and local governments.\n    \n>* At the federal level, about one-third of outlays are matched by tax collections from illegal aliens. At the state and local level, an average of less than 5 percent of the public costs associated with illegal immigration is recouped through taxes collected from illegal aliens.\n    \n>*Most illegal aliens do not pay income taxes. Among those who do, much of the revenues collected are refunded to the illegal aliens when they file tax returns. Many are also claiming tax credits resulting in payments from the U.S. Treasury.\n\n\nhttp://www.fairus.org/publications/the-fiscal-burden-of-illegal-immigration-on-united-states-taxpayers\n\nDo you have any sources for your "most studies" to look at?
It's Oregon. Who the fuck knows what they're capable of?
Yeah, unfortunately, people can be so toxic that you can hardly say "I hope it rains tomorrow" without people shouting at you.  Although, I find frequently people get riled up and shoot off a nasty post before they think, but if you reply calmly you can get a pretty reasonable response. \n\nI still like to think the majority of people can be reasonable.\n\nAlso, I've never seen the sub either, it just seemed it need a rebuttal.  \n\nThanks for your reply! 
Now replace "escaped slave" with "petty criminal".  Do you still feel the same way?
This is the right vote.  There is no requirement for a president to turn over his tax returns.  There is a 'precedent', which you can follow or ignore.  You can not force Trump to release them, especially not to the public.
They should be held to a higher standard, and they are, as they have to run for election in the national spotlight.  The truth is people have much bigger issues to deal with, or areas of greater concern about the candidates.  \n\nThe higher focus on the President means that his private information will surely be leaked to the public, which is just one more reason for good people to decide not to run for president, leaving us with the current crop of candidates.
>i appreciate the detailed response.\n\nAny time.  I love this subreddit, add the option to discuss different viewpoints with people who see things differently.\n\n>the question is not whether they're obligated "to be yelled at". it's whether they're obligated to be there in the first place *regardless of how the crowd treats them*. \n\nNo.  There is no constitutional requirement for townhalls, to my knowledge.  There are many other ways to be in touch with your representatives: Email, phone, visit their office.\n\nThis to my way of thinking, is under the category of 'people that have ruined things for everyone else'.  Townhalls are great to meet the reps face to face with your community, and put a personal touch on issues.  But none of that can happen in these boisterous shouting matches.  If you want to angrily say "Obamacare did this for me, how will you ensure I don't lose it?" Fine.  If you want to say "You're killing grandma you SOB", or whatever, and shout down his and everyone else's response, then communication is pointless.  You're free to shout that, of course, but he is not obligated to stand there and listen to it.  Not should he, in my opinion.\n\n>American democracy has never been predicated on mutual respect between the representative and their constituents. the US was founded on loud, angry (and ultimately violent) dissent.  There is nothing in our constitution or bylaws that says "citizens should be respectful and meek to their congressmen". \n\nAgreed.  But loud obnoxious dissent is frequently the worst way to try and persuade people to your side.  Now, no one cares about my opinion, but watching these videos makes me side with the rep against these loudmouths regardless of who is right, likely the same as many would feel watching right wing groups shot down Democratic congressmen over installing congressman.  I think, again personal opinion, these personal accounts of how Obamacare has helped people are far more compelling.\n\n>now, should violent protest be allowed? of course not. is it productive for protesters to come in and shout the rep down without giving them a chance to say their piece? probably not. \n\nAgreed.\n\n>shouldn't the representative have to sit through the town hall as a matter of principle (so long as people don't start physically assaulting him)?\n\nNo.  No reason I can think of.  It's pointless, it angers people up, and there are numerous ways to get your opinions heard.  Again, I'm talking people who just tell, and jeer, and shout people down.  If you tell your story, even if angry, and will listen to a response, then he should stay. And I think most would.\n\n\n>(also, protesting the pledge is fair game; the pledge is inherently religious and protests against any government-endorsed religious speech are completely valid)\n\nYou are free to do that, of course.  But it suggests you're there (to me) to make a ruckus, not discuss things.\n\n>essentially what you're saying with this is - representatives are entitled to respect and cordiality, \n\nYes.  Everyone is.  Just like the President is entitled to ride around in a convertible, or I should be entitled to walk around the White House, as a US citizen.  But we don't always get  what we're entitled.\n\n>this entitlement is equal to, or trumps the basic principles of a representative democracy. is that a fair assessment of your position?\n\nNo, of course not.  Nothing trumps our representative democracy.  But that is not dependent on town halls.  I've never been, I imagine most people haven't.  Yet I feel represented.  I think town halls are a great thing.  But democracy will march along fine without them.
It works the same way, but different companies support a surprising number of drugs, and they are susceptible to public outcry.  And competition. If a company supports a drug, it will attract people to that company.
>So you think building a wall across one out of four borders has the magical power to stop virtually all illegal crossings? That must be some powerful magic to stop people thousands of miles away.\n\nObviously it will only work on that one border, which is all that it is intended to do.  But you know the vast majority cross the Southern border.  In 2014, still 500,000 people were stopped trying to cross, with many more succeeding.  The wall can stop these.\n\n>Now back to reality: more Latin Americans are leaving the US than entering, for several years now. \n\nMexicans maybe, I haven't heard all Latin Americans.\n\n> no valid reason to build a border wall to stop an imaginary influx of illegal immigrants. \n\nYour incorrect opinion.  And hundreds of thousands of people is not imaginary.\n\n\n>The real question is whether to spend half a trillion dollars deporting those that are already here, or just give them a pathway to citizenship so more of them can climb the social ladder and be less of a tax burden as they age out of the labor pool.\n\n\nThis is an extremely uninformed opinion.  Amnesty was done already in the 1980's for 3 million people, and the result is today's problem of 12 million illegal immigrants.   Amnesty only encourages further illegal immigration.  This has been proven here.  Besides, per you, immigrants are mass exiting already.  Just keep the new ones from coming.\n\nThe real answer is secure the border, enhance follow up of expired visas, expel all the violent and dangerous illegal immigrants.  Then we can decide what best to do with those already here.
I'm not sure we have a consensus definition of what a death panel is.  But this group of unelected officials has the ability to deny coverage of treatments or medications to those on Medicare to reign in costs, which could result in death.  So, it's never been done, but death panel isn't as far fetched as it sounds.
Yes, I understand.  And it was right to not force him to turn over his tax returns, or to place any new, unconstitutional requirements of the President for purely political reasons.
The pleasure is mine.  I hope you continue to give helpful responses.
My mistake.  I fed the troll.  I hope your search does find Christ.
I didn't say anything about what you said or didn't say.  And we don't know what he was going to say, as everyone shouted him down.\n\nI think there were no winners in this scene.  He lost his cool, and handled it poorly and was insulting, but the public was being obnoxious and childish.
No, that is not the case.  \n\nA copy from a post I made in this thread:\n\nCalling them death panels and saying they were going to judge people's worth is political grandstanding, but what is being referred to is [Independent Payment Advisory Board](http://www.modernhealthcare.com/article/20161201/NEWS/161139993), a non elected group charged with controlling Medicare's costs.  They could decide, for example, that a new cancer drug that only affects a hundred people a year is too expensive, and decline to cover it.\n\nNow, this has not happened, but is well within their designated power, and appears to be specifically designed to shield Congress from the political effects of these decisions.\n\nIt is not clear to me why Palin and her spokesperson point to the part of the bill about end of life counseling, but the IPAB is given that power, despite including that they would not allow rationing.\n\nAnd it's why, there have been several bipartisan efforts to repeal this part.\n\nHistrionic, maybe, but not a lie. 
>Also how does a 2 million dollar property turn into a 100 million dollar property? Even with inflation that makes no sense.\n\nReal estate frequently outpaces inflation.\n\n>I mean, my counterpoint to your counterpoint would be, Warren Buffet could only claim 3 million of 2.85 billion dollars he contributed to charity. \n\nWarren Buffett's actual income is "only" 12 million.  He could deduct up to half of that for charitable donations.  He chose to deduct only [$3.5 million](https://www.fool.com/retirement/2016/10/13/5-warren-buffett-tax-facts-we-just-learned.aspx).\n\n>Why would Trump give away a park worth 100 million for a tax write off? \n\nFinancially, it doesn't make sense.  It was a gift.  He donated the land to have a park made out of it.\n\n>Also the land was useless to him because he couldn't build a golf course there which was his initial plan. \n\nThe land is hardly useless.  It was worth somewhere between $2 and $100 million.
That is not true.  One piece by itself doesn't tell the story, you have to look at the whole picture, then compare them to historical standards.  \n\nIt's no different than Obama saying the unemployment is 5%, which sounds good, but doesn't tell the whole story.\n\nWhat Trump said is 100% true, and puts the worst spin on the current situation, and is exactly what Obama did, (and all politicians do in the same scenario).
Glad you're having fun, but I'm not sure how my stating facts is ignorance.\n\nRegardless, again I ask, why are you still doing this?  You obviously have nothing to say about this other then name calling and repeating your meritless arguments.  Are you just seeing how long before I quit replying? 
Just because you don't like the conclusion doesn't mean the source is invalid.\n\nRegardless, they've given their numbers.  What numbers do you have, and we'll look at them.
Uh huh.  Back at it.  Can you tell me what view I have that is ignorant, as I keep quoting facts, and your sole argument is "you're a coward, and ignorant", the calling card of someone who has lost an argument.\n\nHere's my view.  Some immigrants are bad people, who rape, murder, and riot.  And we can't tell which are the bad ones, and which are not.\n\nThe facts are in my side.
This is patently untrue.  Illegal immigrants obtain far more benefits that they pay in:\n\n>In 2010, the average unlawful immigrant household received around $24,721 in government benefits and services while paying some $10,334 in taxes. This generated an average annual fiscal deficit (benefits received minus taxes paid) of around $14,387 per household).\n\n>There are approximately 3.7 million unlawful immigrant households in the U.S. These households impose a net fiscal burden of around $54.5 billion per year.\n\n-http://www.heritage.org/immigration/report/the-fiscal-cost-unlawful-immigrants-and-amnesty-the-us-taxpayer\n\n
Except no, they cost the government more than they pay in taxes:\n>In 2010, the average unlawful immigrant household received around $24,721 in government benefits and services while paying some $10,334 in taxes. This generated an average annual fiscal deficit (benefits received minus taxes paid) of around $14,387 per household).\n\n-http://www.heritage.org/immigration/report/the-fiscal-cost-unlawful-immigrants-and-amnesty-the-us-taxpayer\n

Sorry for the late response.  Thanks for writing back.\n\nI must say I'm a little surprised at the condescension for this sub.  It was not a single verse, but a passage.  I only quoted only one verse to keep the post short, but here is the fuller reference:\n\n>13 Let every person be subject to the governing authorities. For there is no authority except from God, and those that exist have been instituted by God. 2 Therefore whoever resists the authorities resists what God has appointed, and those who resist will incur judgment. 3 For rulers are not a terror to good conduct, but to bad. Would you have no fear of the one who is in authority? Then do what is good, and you will receive his approval, 4 for he is God's servant for your good. But if you do wrong, be afraid, for he does not bear the sword in vain. For he is the servant of God, an avenger who carries out God's wrath on the wrongdoer. 5 Therefore one must be in subjection, not only to avoid God's wrath but also for the sake of conscience. 6 For because of this you also pay taxes, for the authorities are ministers of God, attending to this very thing. 7 Pay to all what is owed to them: taxes to whom taxes are owed, revenue to whom revenue is owed, respect to whom respect is owed, honor to whom honor is owed.\n\nAnd if you all know fully well Paul's argument, maybe you could share it with me or point me to a discussion on the topic.  I understand the message, but I'm having trouble figuring out how to apply it.\n\n>There were MANY occasions were Christians broke the law or defied a government, in many countries in many different forms and purposes, seeking to obey the biggest divine commandments.\n\nI understand, and which I imagine is not controversial.  But how do you define, or what applies when not dealing with the biggest commandments?  That is the issue at hand, and you have not really answered the question.\n\nSo, I guess my question boils down to this:  How do we act, with respect to that passage is in the Bible (which per my beliefs, is the word of God?)\n\nOption 1:  Assume it only means like taxes, and speed limits, and doesn't really apply to laws involving people and moral issues (this seems to be what you favor).  An example maybe, would be to help a hungry father who has stolen food for his family evade police capture.  Certainly you'd help the family in the future, but what do you do about the police?\n\nOption 2:  more or less ignore the passage, with similar actions to #1.\n\nThose options, while appealing, seem to downplay the passage.  I feel there is some line, as implied in the above, that above this line, you're free to not subject yourself to the authorities.  I'm just having trouble drawing this line.  To me, personally, I think its clear I should accept punishments given to me.  But for others, it's a bit blurrier.  But, I feel that line as drawn by that passage is higher than being discussed here.\n\nIf you have any thoughts on this matter, I would enjoy hearing them.
>Thanks for that reply. I thought you were a troll too. Sorry about the insults.\n\nNo big deal.  You should see what I got from /r/enoughTrumpSpam.\n\n>I agree with you nearly 100%. That's a very measured response. It's also exactly the opposite of what Trump did, by attempting to ban those 7 countries. What he did was clumsy, rushed, and it reeks of bigotry.\n\nMaybe, it depends.  I think he made a political decision, not necessarily a good policy decision.  I think it depends what happens after the 90 days.  I think he chose those 7, specifically because they were the 7 chosen during the Obama administration as a way to deflect blame after so much Muslim Ban talk.  It would be nice if politicians would make wise even if unpopular policy, but I guess you can't make policy if you use your elections.\n\n>What you wrote is good politics, though. I don't know your thoughts on Obama, but it's the kind of thing he would have done, more or less:\n\nYes, I'm familiar with that action, and I think that was a reasonable response.  I think it's kind of splitting hairs, whether it's a ban or a slowdown.  Net effect is we took about half the number of refugees that year.\n>18,251 in 2010, 6,339 in 2011 and 16,369 in 2012.\n\nI think, clearly, in that case you definitely need to re-evaluate the process, which was done.  What I like, and what surprises me as an argument against, is that I feel like Trump is trying to be more pro-active, trying to anticipate a problem before it happens.  People argue that there were no terrorist attacks from these 7 countries, which is true.  But that doesn't mean there won't be.  I feel like previously, like the shoe bomber for example, something happens, then we react even though it's unlikely they'll try that exact same method again.  Obviously you can't anticipate everything, but looking to the future is a good change.\n\nAs a Trump supporter, I'm willing to give Trump the benefit of the doubt.  As an opponent, you are not.  I think that's fair.  Trump used a lot of angry rhetoric, and he needs to declare what kind of president he will be.  I'm hoping he shows sensible yet compassionate plans.  Still helping those that need help, but keeping out most of the unknown elements.\n\nI think in most issues there's not as much difference as it seems, it's just the times where everything has gotten so polarized it's hard to have a good discussion.  I've put out a few angry posts, and frequently I get surprised by a reasonable response back.  And almost always, I learn more about issues I was fairly sure I understood well.\n\nIn any case, it was good to have this discussion with you.  Thanks for taking the time to write back.
Hi, I appreciate the response.  I am not expert enough in coal emissions to know individual regulations.  I have just been talking in general about hypothetical regulations with no significant scientific benefit should not be imposed soley to drive coal out of business.  \n\nI'm not sure about coal mines, but it's hard to predict what will happen with demand.  Right now gas is edging under the price of coal, but natural gas prices seem more volatile and who knows the future of fracking.  I would be happy for natural gas to take over.\n\n>There are parts of FL that don't use any coal?\n\n I apologise, I am apparently in error.  It's hard to tell, but it looks like 18-37% of the power I use is from coal.  I'll change above, even though no one will see it.  Hopefully it's moot, as I'm planning to convert my house to solar, in which case it will be zero.
In what way is it dysfunctional?
I again appreciate your response.  And I'm not really trying to argument for or against immigration laws, as every case is individual.  If it were straightforward like the Holocaust, or slavery, I think it's clear we should not follow the law.  \n\nBut I struggle with Romans 13:5\n> 5 So you must obey the government, not just because you might be punished, but because you know it is the right thing to do.\n\nThat can't be only for laws you agree with, or think are godly, because there's no reason for a verse like that.  \n\nMaybe this example: it's illegal to witness for Christ in a certain park... I would therefore still do it, if I thought it right, as that clearly is against Gods teaching.\n\nThe police find me out, and the penalty is 3 nights in a modern US jail.  I don't think you should help me evade that penalty, based on the above verse, even though the law is unjust.  If the penalty is death, again, different story maybe.\n\nI feel immigration law is the same.  Even though we want to help these people, biblically speaking, I'm not sure we should be helping subvert the laws from the government.
>No, it's an intentional lie. There are no death panels. \n>\n>Death panels?  \n\nYou are mistaken.  While obviously not called death panels, this refers to the [Independent Payment Advisory Board](http://www.modernhealthcare.com/article/20161201/NEWS/161139993), a non elected group charged with controlling Medicare's costs.  They could decide, for example, that a new cancer drug that only affects a hundred people a year is too expensive, and decline to cover it.\n\nNow, this has not happened, but is well within their designated power, and appears to be specifically designed to shield Congress from the political effects of these decisions.
I'll pray for you.  I hope you find your way.
Plus, they always tell me I'm their favorite customer.  I feel bad for the rest of you chumps.   Now, I shall perform the superior dance.\n\n
The lighting from below helps emphasize the horror.  :-)\n\n
That message being, in the words of Dave Barry:  Hi!  I'm naked as a jay bird!\n\nI was never a big fan of Jimmy Carter, but this was a good message, full of hope.\n\n
I can't imagine any consumer would prefer a non-removable battery.  There's no reason this would benefit anyone.\n\nAs far as thinner devices, I think the troubles with recent iPhones and other similar devices speak for themselves.  While there is a legitimate reason to want a thinner device, I would expect the average user to prefer more battery life and more features.\n
I wouldn't consider it gossip in light of Voris' recent revelations.  It's definitely conjecture, but it's not gossip.
And if I wonder if it would occur to any of them that the typical Trump supporter would see this as a good thing!  It's like a hunger strike.  "So let me get this right, you're going to cause yourself to suffer unless I do what you want?  Ouch."
There is no good reason, in my opinion, for His Holiness to refuse to answer. It would have been an act of charity to answer the cardinals even if he thought it wasn't necessary.  It's hard not to imagine it an act of hubris for him to snub a respectful request for clarity.\n
This is all well and good, but if <i>Amoris</i> were truly orthodox _and_ unambiguous, then all the bishops would interpret it the same way.  I don't mean perfectly identically in terms of how they should deal with the issues on a pastoral level, but in ways which are not in complete contradiction with the ways other bishops interpret it, i.e., invalidly "married" people living as husband and wife may or may not be admitted to communion.\n\nI think the logical conclusion is that <i>Amoris</i> is either heterodox (which I don't believe), or needlessly ambiguous (which I do believe).  The dubia were never an attack on Pope Francis, and I believe it is wrong for him to act as if it were.  The dubia were themselves an act of charity to help retain the unity of the Church.\n\nThe 4 cardinals never accused His Holiness of anything, especially of heresy.  They just asked for some clarification on issues where some bishops are diametrically disagreeing with others.   They all cannot be right, and it was perfectly reasonable for Cardinal Burke, et al, to ask for clarification.  \n\nI think it is only charitable that the Holy Father address these questions.  What does he have to lose by answering these simple questions?   By failing to do so, he increases the confusion and scandal in the Church... in exchange for what good?
You know, I dislike this Pope as much as the next faithful Catholic, but I still refer to His Holiness in respectful terms.  "Frankie boy" is really childish, especially given that there are legitimate criticisms to be made.  He's still our Holy Father, and we should pray for him, and pray for the Church.  That said, your analysis is probably spot on.\n
Where I work, we have a device called a protocol processor and after 4 years I can finally hear people talk about the "PP" without giggling to myself.
That's fine, and I agree with the idea of standing up against that kind of behavior by men.  Here's the problem... very few, almost no one, made the same kind of protests when Democrats were in high office who engaged in the same kind of behavior and much, much worse.  Their protests would carry just a little more weight if they held everyone to the same standards.  I would salute and respect the feminists who _did_ hold all people to the same standard, but they were very rare.\n
I like Voris a lot, but sometimes I think he looks too hard for reasons to be offended, and as others have said, tends to exaggerate.  It's also somewhat hypocritical how harshly he attacks certain bishops, but won't say anything in criticism of the Pope, who is often guilty of the same kinds of things.  So I think he's on the right track, but I think he spends the "angry rant" nickel a little too often.\n\nOn the other hand, if you aren't shocked and dismayed at the state of the Church in recent decades, you aren't paying attention, or you're part of the problem.   We all know God will triumph in the end, but between now and then, no one can make any guarantees, except that Church won't go away completely.\n\nI think Pope Benedict's prediction of a much smaller but purer Church is becoming more and more likely every passing year.  I wonder this prediction hasn't made more of a splash, seeing as how it's quite shocking to the status quo.\n\n
Are the shows going to be 90 minutes long?  (i.e., 2 hours minus commercials)  \n\nI would think that they'd be unfettered from that limitation and could make them as long as they want.\n\n
I wouldn't call misophonia a mental illness.  It's a neurological condition.\n
I think it's pretty funny that MST3K is coming out on Good Friday. \n\nI guess I will just wait and it can be my Easter present!  :-)\n
This is what it's all about.  Merry Christmas!\n
No way.  I'm hoping for Bay-style pyrotechnics and CGI.  I want to see all of that $5.5 million on the screen in glorious HD.
I think it's pretty settled that there are a lot of people trying to destroy the Church from within, between the spiritual descendants of the communist infiltrators talked about by Bella Dodd, to the open dissent of, e.g., some of the German bishops.   The Roman Church is in schism in all but name these days... even Pope Francis seems to recognize that, although it's unclear which side he thinks is the right one.  Or maybe not.\n\nIt is not without reason that Pope Paul talked about the smoke of Satan in the Vatican.
Yeah, I totally respect the idea of not picking on children of celebrities and politicians.  In my opinion, this is just funny, not mocking or demeaning the child.   It's not like we're Saturday Night Live writers here.\n\n
Sorry, that's not an ugly face.   A little weird, but definitely not ugly.  :-)\n
And every leader since then...\n
The first two books are not all that important.  Sure, they're fun to read, but Terry was in what I like to think of as "Douglas Adams mode":   The setting was just a substrate for humor delivery and poking fun at fantasy tropes.  The books are very imaginative, and definitely funny, but there's not much story to them.\n\nThen with "Equal Rites" the books start developing the fantasy world into something as rich and detailed as anything this side of Tolkien and the Discworld became so much more than a parody, it became real fantasy in its own right.  Suddenly, we were getting a rich, detailed world, complex and believable characters that we actually cared about, but the humor was always there and always razor sharp.\n\nAs he grew as a writer, the stories became much more important, and much more interesting to the point where the fantasy aspects of the stories became a substrate for telling good stories that happen to be very funny.  The world he built became so rich and detailed that he could just pick a part of it and zoom in to something fascinating, with a focus on the plot and the characters (like, say Wodehouse), and despite the fantastic setting, he could write a fascinating tale about things that were much more mundane and down-to-earth without losing the qualities that made the earlier books so good.  To wit:  one of my favorite fantasy novels is about banking ("Making Money").  There's no way a story largely about finance could be as appealing and funny and page-turning as it is unless the author writes great characters and a good plot.\n\nAlso, keep in mind that the Discworld books aren't a series, they are more like about half a dozen series that overlap somewhat.  I would definitely recommend reading them in order, but if you can't for some reason, it's often not going to ruin anything.\n\nAs far as audiobooks go, I have over a dozen Discworld audiobooks and I love listening to them on my commute.  There are four readers that I've heard:  Nigel Planer (Neil the hippie from 'The Young Ones'), who is my favorite by a slight margin, Stephen Briggs, who is technically a better reader than Nigel Planer, and does the voices and accents very well, but lacks a certain quirkiness that makes Nigel Planer appeal to me just a little more, Tony Robinson (Baldrick from Blackadder), who I also really enjoy, (I think he's particularly well suited for the stories about the Watch) and Celia Imrie, who is  a very good reader, but I don't care much for her voice acting.  She does the witches all wrong, in my option.  
I don't think this is mocking him, just pointing out that it's funny.   There's a difference.\n\nBesides, we were all 10 and awkward once.  Some of us are still awkward.\n
Maybe he does.  I think he grabbed one.
Cinematic Titanic did the same thing.  They would stop the movie a couple times for some contrived reason and do a bit.  It's a very natural way to break up the show even when it's not needed for commercials.\n
No, they are Christ's rules and reiterated by St. Paul:\n\n"Therefore whoever eats the bread or drinks the cup of the Lord in an unworthy manner, shall be guilty of the body and the blood of the Lord."\n\nWho has the authority to determine this on Christ's behalf?  The Church.  That's what He said, and if you have a problem with that, take it up with Him.  We are just trying to do what He told us to do.\n\nChrist didn't establish a Bible, He established a Church, and He very clearly gave His Church the authority to make these decisions.  So the Catholic Church is certainly not being blasphemous in reserving Communion to those who are properly disposed to receive it, the Church is trying to act in accordance with Christ's commands.\n\nIf you don't believe the Eucharist is the literal Body, Blood, Soul and Divinity of Christ, then you are most assuredly not disposed to receive it because this is what He tells us It is.   Pray for God to reveal His truths to you.  We are all stubborn and failed humans, but God knows this and is always reaching out to us.\n\nIf you do believe, then quit messing around and become Catholic, you've accepted the most important part.  The more you learn about the Church (as opposed to the massive amount of misinformation, even among Catholics), the more you will see it is what it claims to be, despite the scandals, despite the arguing, despite the snarky comments on Reddit and despite the sins and flaws of every single person who's ever been a member of the Church except for Christ and His mother.
If so, let's not be grumpy Catholics.  That will only discourage them.
Everyone is welcome to attend Mass, but if you are receiving Communion, in addition to receiving the Body and Blood of Christ, you are professing a state of Communion (hence the name) with Catholics everywhere, a state which doesn't exist by your own admission.  \n\nIf you are trolling, you are wasting a lot of people's time, but if you are, as I hope, really inquiring, then please don't pick and choose scripture to try to defend your inconsistent claims and try to understand what we are saying.   \n\nAlso, don't rely solely on a bunch of Reddit cranks, including me, but seek out an RCIA program or at least talk to a priest.  
Who else thinks this looks like a Dust Buster?\n
How are the bots' voices?   From what I heard (which isn't much), the new actors sound fine, except... they both sound very similar, and Tom and Crow have always had very distinctive voices.  This has always bothered me, especially because when you are watching the movie, you are not focusing on the puppet movement to know who's talking (and shouldn't have to).\n\nRegardless, I'm so psyched for the new season.\n
I don't think the Pope is good at describing anything.  He always sounds like he doesn't quite have his thoughts worked out and is thinking out loud.
Meaning no disrespect to His Eminence, but I believe there are some German and Argentine bishops who would beg to differ.\n
Hey, I paid for ugly and I expect ugly!
And I would add that I think your description of your stand on the issue of immigration is very reasonable and, (in my opinion, of course), not in conflict with any Catholic teaching.
Well, keep up the research and the questions, and don't let anyone's reaction, even mine, discourage you.  Keep searching for the truth.

I attend a TLM some weeks at St. John the Apostle in Leesburg, VA.  There are lots of young families with small children including babies at that Mass.  They are very welcome.\n\nI first went to a Latin Mass around the year 2000 at St. Agnes parish in Baton Rogue, LA with my wife and 4 children, all under the age of 7, and I noticed something quite surprising.  Since everyone was completely silent before Mass started, the children were much quieter than usual as well.  It's amazing how their behavior reflects those around them.   Had it been possible at the time (we were visiting my in-laws, who suggested we go to the Latin Mass for Christmas Day), we would have continued, because the different atmosphere had a beneficial effect on the children's restlessness.\n\nAt our Mass at St. John's, the Latin reading and gospel are followed by the same readings in English... although I've picked up enough Latin to occasionally recognize the reading before I hear it in English.  The homily is, of course, in English.\n\nOur parish offers missalettes that include the Latin and English side by side, so after a few times, it becomes really easy to follow along and know where you are, even if though of the Mass is spoken in a low voice.\n\n\n
I hear they get their names from the Society for Creative Pseudonyms.\n
Almost every skip breaks (or transforms) fundamental laws of physics, so any of them would mean that the world is incredibly different than what we commonly believe it to be.  \n\nThis idea is both fascinating and terrifying, especially given that modern physics tells us that world really is incredibly different that we commonly believe it to be.   The upside is that it usually manages to do so without lots of people dying in incredibly hideous ways.\n
Not comparable to Christ, but comparable to men, he is Lord of the World.\n
I got "Raising Steam" from Audible, and found it pretty boring.  By about halfway through I was just waiting for it to finish just to see what happened.  It was pretty boring to me.   If you go on Amazon, a lot of the reviewers are convinced it was ghost-written (presumably by Rhianna).  I don't hold it against the author... he was struggling with a disease I really can't imagine, but the book left a real sour taste in my mouth.   I started it again, but soon got even more bored with it and switched to "Interesting Times".\n\nThat's why I haven't read "Shepherd's Crown".  I'm afraid it won't be a good book.\n
12-year-old me is in love. \n\n51-year-old me is impressed.\n\n
If you are partaking of Communion, then you must think it's a good thing (which it is).  Therefore, you should carefully and seriously understand everything that goes with it, right?   Christ doesn't offer salvation unconditionally.  You need to do your part as well.  That doesn't mean you earn salvation, but it does mean that you must cooperate with the salvific work that Christ did on your behalf.  An important part of that cooperation is recognizing His authority, which was given to the Church.
I think it is nothing less than the fulfillment of the prophecies of Our Lady of Akita.   Whether or not you believe in the private revelation, what it describes is absolutely happening and absolutely happening now.\n
OK, well then I think you and I are basically saying the same thing.  There's no doubt that the majority of Catholics really don't take their faith seriously, which makes me sad.

Yeah, and I've heard it expressed as if "Man of the Year", which is what it was called at the time, was an endorsement, which it definitely wasn't.  There have been lots of heroes and villains on the list over 90 years.

That is a spectacularly ugly face!  Brava!\n
These kinds of minor overlaps occur not infrequently, such as when the President requires a medical procedure that involves being anesthetized for a brief time, which I recall happened to Bush 43. 
Someone above was unfamiliar with the "/s" notation.  Perhaps they might think it means "stuff you would hear on /r/politics."   That's it, right?  ;-)
The Church has never required belief in miracles since the end of public revelation.  The strongest statement She will make is that an alleged miracle is worthy of belief.  That doesn't mean these miracles don't happen, and haven't happened, but it shouldn't be the basis of your faith. 
I used to have something like this when I was a kid.  Eventually my parents got me a real electronic calculator when I was about 8 or 9, but of course, idiot that I am, I lost it.\n\n\n
This is conjecture:\n\n"and obviously has very strong guilt feelings which he is working out through a public ministry. As a result, he does not always make wise choices."\n\n
Yeah, the rest of the uniform could pass for a more modern era, but not that hat.  That is one pimpin' hat!  :-)
No, but I can see where tons of people thought the moderation was fair.   After all, everything Trump says is a lie, right?\n
Trump is a result of division, not the cause.  He's run for President before and never got any traction.
I appreciate what you are saying, but I think it is a fight and it is a fight for nothing less than the heart and soul of Church doctrine.  It is a fight that was acknowledged by Pope Paul when he warned about the smoke of Satan being in the Church, and by Pope Benedict who warned that the Church would soon be much smaller, but much more pure.  These are not mild warnings but clarion calls that the Church is in deep trouble.\n
Since everything Congress does is extremely expensive, and most of the what Congress does has negative unintended consequences, I would tend to disagree that a "do-nothing Congress" is a bad thing.\n
I saw the same post in r/misophonia...\n
Beautiful eyes and that's an impressive, um, talent she's got with them.  :-)\n
I think the upholding of the Church's teaching and keeping it from being distorted, which it absolutely is, is much more important.  No one is disputing that the Church needs to take care of the poor, and it is.  Are you suggesting their Eminences' time is better spent in soup kitchens?
So... spending more than 6 hours on Wikipedia in one sitting.  Or more than 6 minutes on TVTropes.  ;-)\n
>  On top of that, Catholics do tend to be more anti-intellectual than protestants,\n\nNot in any world I've ever lived in.  The whole religion vs. science thing is a result of the Protestants, many of whom are literally anti-science.  The stereotype of religious people being anti-science is far more due to Protestants, especially the fundamentalist types, than it ever has been from anything Catholic, Galileo notwithstanding.  The take-away from the Galileo incident is not that it happened, or that the Church hierarchy did something wrong, but that it was such a rare occurrence.  Ask anyone who is braying about Galileo to name another example. And, no, Bruno doesn't count.\n\nNo, Catholics are far more likely to embrace modern culture, including all the aspects that contradict Catholic teaching.
Yes, that's our guy, warts and all.  He did some pretty awful things, but that's who Jesus chose and He knew what He was doing.  It gives me great encouragement that someone as flawed as Peter (who was also great, of course), was chosen to lead the Church, because it gives me hope that someone as flawed as me can end up in Heaven.\n
Unless of course, you are Michael Voris...\n
What is OK after an annulment is the same thing that is OK for anyone who has never married, since they are the same thing.  \n\nTo which "this" are you referring when you say you are at odds?\n
There's an audiobook version of "Flatland" on Librivox that is excellent.\n
I asked my pastor this question a few years ago and he said, in so many words, "No".  He said words to the effect that these are just opinions of a committee and do not reflect the teaching authority of the magisterium. \n\nI'll be honest, I'm really tired of the USCCB preaching politics instead of teaching faith and morals.  Between gun control, open borders and socialized health care they've sounded for decades like an arm of the Democrat Party instead of princes of the Church, with positions that are often completely orthogonal to Catholic morality and social teaching.\n
They can certainly be read that way, but sometimes you'll miss out on the huge number of callbacks.  There's no other alternative:  You have to read them all multiple times.  :-)\n
I don't hate Pope Francis, and I won't disrespect him as others in this sub are doing.  But on the other hand, he is doing incredible damage to the Church.  It's not all bad though, he's bringing out in the open a schism that has been festering for a century or more and has accelerated in recent decades.  I think Pope Benedict's comments about a much smaller, but purer Church were his statement about the same thing, and it's happening before our eyes.  
My college roommate had this poster.
Agreed. Only thing I can think of is the top headline somewhat insinuates that Sessions is already under probe or its probable that he will be.
But I don't think that's what the dubia were about.  They were specifically questions on how the document should be interpreted.  They did not suggest the document should be contradicted.\n\nIn light of this, I think His Eminence has clearly answered at least one of the dubia.  \n\nPray for the Church and the Pope.\n
I thought Rebelations was refudiated as canon by the Council of Ghent.
So with regard to your best friend, while it may appear as if Father is violating doctrine, which is certainly not within his authority, neither you nor I know all the details.  It is best to always give them the benefit of the doubt.\n\nWith regards to your mother-in-law, if she were simply (civilly) divorced, i.e., separated from her husband, who was abusive to her, that alone would not require her to refrain from receiving Communion.  \n\nI would strongly suggest she talk to a priest about the matter, because what you are describing does not sound correct, or there is something else going on.  I would recommend talking to a priest, because no matter what has happened it is possible to reconcile yourself with the Church and regain access to the sacraments.\n\nThere are absolutely legitimate reasons why someone might separate from a spouse, and you have described perhaps the most significant one, but that alone is not a mortal sin nor, from how you described it, a sin at all.  \n\nI would suggest that it's possible her understanding is incorrect, or she has been improperly advised, or there are important details not mentioned here, but bringing this up with a priest can only help.
There's nothing to stop them.  I hope they do.\n
 It's really pretty simple.  If you are married, you are married until one of you dies.  Period.  An annulment is not a kind of dissolution of marriage, it means that the marriage has been found to have never existed, so the two people who were granted an annulment are free to marry since they are, and always have been, single.  Annulments are granted when one or both people are not properly disposed to marry, e.g., their intentions were dishonest, or they were forced.  "Incompatibility" or any of the many other reasons commonly given for divorce are not normally grounds for an annulment.\n\nIn the plain words of Jesus, a man who divorces his wife and remarries is committing adultery (and the same for a woman who divorces her husband) because marriage is permanent until one of the spouses dies.  The Church does not recognize divorce, although it recognizes that some so-called marriages were never valid in the first place, and in some cases a separation might be required.  However, in the latter case, the spouses are still married.
Perhaps, but the Church might also be driving a lot more people off for reasons that aren't good.  I like Voris, despite his faults, but I can totally understand why someone wouldn't.  Despite the controversies surrounding it, Pope Francis' talk of mercy and compassion does have deep Christian roots.   Voris is full of righteous anger, which I can respect, but he likewise doesn't seem to want to give anyone the benefit of the doubt.\n
I really do understand the whole "Let's consider the pastoral complexities of people in tough situations."   This is very important, but doctrine is more important because without that, you have no basis upon which to be pastoral.  I totally agree with you that clear, concise statements like Cardinal Müller's are invaluable.\n
I live in Virginia and I don't pay taxes for Rifftrax... which is good 'cause I've bought a lot of them.\n
It's gotten much worse since, and because of, Obama.  His rhetoric is always divisive.  He rarely opens his mouth without insulting someone, usually large swaths of the country.  Race relations have definitely gotten worse and his "bring a gun to a knife fight" talk has directly contributed to that.   Also, we didn't have police being routinely assassinated until Obama started systematically attacking and undermining law enforcement.
I never liked the idea, because it's callous and wasteful even for the Foundation.  Yes. there could be nasty effects that stay hidden, but to just kill them all always bothered me.  Plus, I have to think that word of that would eventually get out, one way or another.\n\nI also like the idea of a D-Class surviving something and actually gaining some loyalty to the Foundation for saving him or her from death row (or whatever).  There are other good ideas that could come from this (and likely have been used), such as D-Class being planted by other GOI to spy (somehow), or other interesting things that could happen if they are able to survive for some time working for the Foundation.\n
I love this album. I bought it on used vinyl 3 times in the 80s trying to find the best condition.  Finally it came out on CD around 1990, although at first only as a Japanese CD.\n\nAlso, if anyone is a fan of "Olias" be sure to check out Johannes Luley's (from Moth Vellum) solo album "Tales From Sheepfather's Grove".   If there ever were a sequel to Olias, this album would be it.  Plus, having been released in 2013, the sound quality is much, much better.   The album was clearly influenced by "Olias of Sunhillow", and the cover art is clearly trying to evoke Roger Dean, but it's its own piece of art.  Similar, but not an imitation.  Trust me, it's a great album.\n
Misophonia has been officially categorized, at least as far as DSM-IV is concerned.  I've never seen it referred to as a mental disorder, and any significant discussion of it (such as this:  http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1039856215613010) tends to focus on neurological topics.
This is excellent, and works exactly like it should, allowing me to quickly scan through and download the ones I like.  Great job!\n\n
After all, Jesus also chose Judas.  He knew what would happen, but he wanted us to understand that even the leaders of Church can be wrong and do evil things.  It's an extremely important lesson.\n

That's an argument for my side. If you get a voucher for your child's education worth $10,000 (it would change from state/county) that can help fund a stay at home parent teaching their child. 
No. The Democrats have lost at every level of government. House, Senate, Governorships, state assemblies, are all dominated by Republicans. This happened after 2010, once the Obama policies took place. Hillary Clinton was the biggest loss in a while, but democrats have been losing for 6 straight years. \n\nObama has high approval ratings because the man oozes charisma. He is our first celebrity politician. He goes on Jimmy Fallon to read mean tweets, he invites Kendrick Lamar to the White House, has a fantasy basketball team, and gives sonorous, well crafted political speeches urging action, without actually getting anything done. \n\nObama will always be popular, but his policies are not. If the GOP wins in 2018 and starts changing the constitution, you can thank Obama. 
The walls in Israel are all fitted with pressure sensors to prevent tunneling. Trump has mentioned doing the same thing for his wall. 
White are ~70% of the population, so they commit mass shootings at a rate roughly equal to their population amount. Muslims are <1 % of the population in the US yet commit 6% of the terrorism. (These are the most flattering estimates). \n\nFurther, once you account for mental illness vs religious/political motivated terrorism, the balance shifts even more to Muslim terrorism being a bigger threat. \n\nEdit: the numbers I used to get 6% come from a left leaning source that categorized property damage as terrorism. If you go by total deaths, radical Islamic extremism is by far the source of more terrorism than any movement since the IRA. \n\nEdit 2: since I know lots of people want to call me an islamophobe, know that I recognize that terrorism has no religion. However, one religious minority is using terrorism more than any other at the moment. \n\nEdit 3: "Islam is a Religion of Peace" debate on IQ2 US (funded by NPR), is a great debate to listen to if you want a more holistic view of Islam in the west and 21st century. Really bright debaters and they present some interesting views.

I think that it's a nice way to respond to riots, which the police seem to want to pacify. But Chicago has been a warzone for years, with only signs of getting worse. People are dying where the police are unable or unwilling to prevent the horrors. This isn't civil unrest, this is a tragedy. If Chicago is unable to maintain order, the state government, then the federal government must be on hand to help. 
Doesn't matter. Your blood can be replaced more easily than a certain sum of money; we still don't let the government take our blood. 
>Trump is an idiot who can't control himself. \n\n>Trump has been secretly coordinating with Putin for 5 years in order to take down the 2 largest political dynasties in American history. \n\nPick one. 
https://m.mic.com/articles/159402/here-s-a-break-down-of-how-african-americans-voted-in-the-2016-election#.pWLzqIRPF\n\n8% of the black population supported Trump, compared to 6% for Romney. \n\nTrump has laid out a new plan for urban development and has the political capital to pursue it. If he is successful at doubling his support in the AA community, the Dems are toast. 
You might not have explored the vast array of right wing media sources. There are the generally pro-trump cheerleaders in Sean Hannity and Rush Limbaugh and Brietbart. There are moderately supportive Trump news sources like the Daily Wire and the Blaze. Conservative hardliners populate National Review. Moderate conservative news aggregator Drudge Report is a pretty standard source for lots of conservatives.  There's also sources like The Federalist which often have libertarian tinges. On top of that there are dozens of very prominent conservative speakers, writers, and radio hosts who produce an impressive amount of content. \n\nIt is easy to think that just because congress has fallen in lockstep with Trump there is no diversity of opinion. I promise you that if you spend 1 week immersed in conservative media you will realize that there is no shortage of media for conservatives.,
16% is enough. If he takes another 8% from the dems, it's actually a 16 point swing, which is huge. You saw what lower turnout in the AA community for Clinton did to her in MI, WI, NC, and PA did. If Trump gets 8% more those states go from toss-up to leaning republican. \n\nIf his urban development programs are successful (not saying they will be), the black community will care far more about their improved station in life than some memes/retweets 4 years ago. 
We keep small countries from being brought in to the sphere of Chinese or Russian influence. This keeps our enemies weak and us strong. 
Bullshit excuse for past behavior that exchanged overt hatred for the soft bigotry of low expectations. 
Yes, white Americans as a group are technically more likely to commit an act of terrorism. However, if you had to pick a out a terrorist, you'd be 6x more likely to be correct if you picked a Muslim than a white person.

Depending on your line of work and number of dependents, some financial advisors would say 12-24 months of expenses. 
It's even worse too if you account for abortions in foreign countries. NARAL and a few other US institutions fight against laws passed in other countries limiting sex selective abortion. They love abortion (not hyperbole) so much that they are okay with people killing female fetuses just so they don't outright ban abortion in those countries.
Well it certainly is human, in that fetus cells certainly not koala, or cucumber. It's not even a religious question. It is a question of what is point does a unborn baby's right to life trump the right of the mother to use her body as she wants. 
Why sit though? You're honoring a Navy SEAL, you can stand a little longer. If I were a politician I'd be damned if I weren't the last one standing to support that woman. I definitely wouldn't be sitting before anyone across the aisle took a seat.\n\nLike Shapiro said, the Dems hate the optics of applauding when Trump is president. In this moment, they hated Trump more than standing for an additional 60 seconds. 
So here's my working theory about Trump. He's an egomaniac, just like everyone who seeks the office of presidency. Beyond that, he doesn't just want to do a good job, he wants to be the new Reagan, an iconoclast. He wants a Trump memorial. The only problem? He doesn't know how to actually enact good policy. He's got a general idea of how the country should go, but he's not a policy wonk.\n\nSo what does he do? Well he's smart enough to know that all great leaders (FDR, Reagan etc) were loved by some people and hated by others, and that in the long run, haters don't matter. So that's why Trump has surrounded himself with National Review's Dream Team. His cabinet is a nightmare for the left and a dream for the right. He's running everything liberal in to the dirt and going to go hard right. He wants to be Maggie Thatcher of American politics, hated by a lot, but remembered, respected, and a constant debate in intellectual circles. 
Oh, haha, brain must have skipped right there. Good rebuttal though.
If you are claiming that a fetus is not a human you are wrong. I will say that you're wrong and will try to help you understand why you're wrong, but it is not a subject of debate. It has specific human DNA and therefore meets the necessary condition of being a human. On those grounds there is no debate. \n\nIf you do not accept that premise, you must have further qualifications as to what makes a human a human. Is it size? Mental capacity? Ability to feel pain? The only trait that all humans have in common is that we share human DNA. If someone does not accept that they are lying to themselves and to you and there is no reason to debate with them. \n
The problem would become apparent pretty quick with any mandate for any size business. If the ACA kicks in at $2,000,000 in sales you want to measure it in, you'll see lots of businesses stop expanding after $1.99 million. If they sell $2.01 million worth of product, Obamacare kicks in and they actually lose money. \n\nIf they did it by profit, you'd see companies spend every last dime every year to avoid incurring the tax. There would be no long term growth plans for any business because they could not save money without being penalized. \n\nThere is simply no way of mandating "large" companies pay for insurance without limiting the ability of small businesses to transform to medium businesses. 
Something that my friend from the U.K. said about their NHS program that I think you might find interesting:\n80% of the people who use it use it for their colds, flu, sore throat, stitches, etc. you get okay service, doesn't matter if it takes a while bc it's free, so you leave happy. Those people who only sparingly use the service love it because it gets the job done and it's free. \n\nThe 20% who hate it are the woman who needs hip surgery and has to wait for 2 months, or the man who had heart surgery and is now stuck in a recovery room with 5 other patients and only sees a nurse once a day.\n\nSo the leftists get to say that their healthcare is great and everyone loves it when really it's just a bandaid covering a much worse wound. \n\nSomething I hoped Cruz would have explained tonight. Even still, man is a champion. 
Would have been a good response, but Cruz would have Cruzified him on that. State the business and income taxes required to pay for it and support for "free" healthcare evaporates pretty quickly. 
That's how bad Obamacare is; Cruz knew the answer before he asked the question.

I just came to this question after I saw an r/atheism post, and a r/politics post, so yeah, I'm not saying most of the country will hate her. In fact, most of the country can't really be bothered about the subtle nuances of DeVos' policies. However, we are on reddit, so those criticisms have been rather prevalent. \n\nTo continue on your point about not ever administrating at or teaching at a public school, I think that's a pretty weak criticism. DeVos has been involved with education for decades, mostly in charter and voucher program implementation. Her job is not to continue the status quo, but to upend it. \n\nI don't expect you to agree with me that charter schools/voucher systems are superior. You should agree with me that someone tasked with completely re-doing the system doesn't have to have detailed knowledge of how the system works; in fact, it is likely helpful that she is not intimately familiar with the status quo, as that would inhibit innovation. 
Mitt Romneys Mormonism has nothing to do with anything. Romney being the biggest pussy in the world is why he needs to go hide in a hole. Romney apologized and cowed to the media at every chance. Remember when the media ran the story of Romney putting his family dog, in a kennel, on the roof of his car, and ran with it for 2 days. If Romney were Trump he would have kicked the medias face in for that shit. Instead, Romney did the tradition GOPe act of "apologize, cower, and hope people don't think you're a racist bc you're a conservative"
Yes. There are more white people, therefore the average shooter is probably white. I'm saying that white people do not commit school shootings at a greater rate than any other group given their size. How are you not getting this? 
You're right, but it's a bit hard for me to say that it is better that one kid be beaten and threatened in the inner city than have his feelings hurt by a Christian teacher. I personally would rather the kid have the ability to choose what school they go to, so they can choose a school that is most appealing to them. 
We should work to improve education. If that means more homeschooling, it is more homeschooling.
Arguments are easy to make when you reduce everything down to straw men. Be better than that.\n\nIf I were to use your example, I would ask you to choose a lead home builder from 2 options. One is a general laborer who has poured foundation, put up sheetrock, and tarred roofs for 15 years. The other is the architect who designed the building and has the blueprints. \n\nYou probably want the architect to make the plans, and then have the laborer implement those plans? Right? Right. Because that's (More or less) how it works. Put someone with the vision in charge, and people underneath with technical knowledge will follow. This is true in every industry and organization. \n\n
It's just for the executive branch, which Trump has power over. It's not a huge deal, but it is symbolic of Trump's eagerness to keep his campaign promises. Further, it can only be removed by executive order, which means no future president will remove it, lest they be faced with a headline saying they legalized corruption. \n\nGood Trump
It was originally designed to protect the sovereignty of states. One of the states rights was slavery, but this is a very myopic way of viewing it. If you believe in federalism, which is s founding principle of our republic, the electoral college is a natural extension of that belief. 
Lol, they're all "verified" people, too.  Coincidence? 
Great question! So I recently just listened to a talk about this. Apparently, the laws passed in the civil rights act were based on common law doctrine of not being able to refuse to provide service to someone in the 1800s. The idea being that if you rode a horse for 50 miles, got to the inn, and they wouldn't serve you, you had a real chance of dying. This is why the rules about segregating hotels and restaurants were the first to be targeted for repeal in the 1960s. \n\nToday, people are far more mobile and society is more tolerant. I would support bills saying that if ones discrimination causes serious threats to life of a mother, like if you refused to sell a black man water and you're the only grocery store in town, you could be sued. However, I think that this would be a rare situation, and is definitely not comparable to refusing to bake a cake. 
Find the evidence of riots and attacks by groups of conservatives. Somehow the march for life and Tea Party rallies didn't have any issues with rioting where BLM and Anti Trump rallies do. 
The point stands though. If there is a right to free speech, does the government have to supply me with paper and pen? No, they just can't deny me the freedom to buy my own paper and pen. 
Yeah... that's the point. She wants to grow her business to employ more people, but if she grows over 50, having to pay for health insurance will make her unprofitable. So she wants to know how she can continue to employ more people and make more money if government regulation makes this exceedingly difficult. 
Exactly! In all of those situations, responsibility was not assumed by the mother so she is under no moral obligation to carry the child. 
The way I see it, there's completely fake news like "Obama brings prayer rug to White House" reported by JeffsPersonalBlogDaily.com or whatever. This is a problem, but not really. Because if you believe JeffsPersonalBlogDaily.com, chances are you're not a high information voter anyway. Like, Obama having a prayer rug didn't make you not like Obama, you already didn't like him, read a fake story, and then continued on your day. \n\nThe real fake news that we need to be concerned with is CNN, Buzzfeed, and Huffington Post. When I watch CNN, I know Don Lemon and Anderson Cooper are not neutral like they say they are, and I can accept a little spin. The problem is stuff like this:\n\nCNN edits video to show BLM calling for peace, actually calls for burning down white neighborhoods. \n\nBuzzfeed publishes a document with unverified information. What is disprovable is disproved by other news agencies shortly after. \n\nMSNBC edits recording of George Zimmerman to show him uninvitingly saying that Trayvon was black when in reality the 911 dispatch had asked him. \n\nI'm mobile so I can't look it up but if you google it you can find it. \n\n\nThese are news agencies we are supposed to trust. High information voters are supposed to be able to listen to CNN and get an accurate idea of what is going on. When Fox News stretched the truth with Obama, everyone cried foul and rightly so. Now almost every other news source has gone in to all out revolt against Trump and it is not right. The media is not a cudgel to be wielded against your enemies. It is an important part of a thriving democracy that, due to its own hubris, will die within the next decade. 
Yeah, I agree. It is hard to understand what is going through the heads of people when they murder. I always go back to that guy who was blowing up abortion doctors. Obviously he was mentally deranged, but to pretend that his pro-life views had nothing to do with him deciding to take action is disingenuous. \n\nSo when someone pledges loyalty to ISIS before an attack, we should understand that they are fucked up in the head while also being motivated by religion. We can say the same about Dylan Roof, obviously fucked up, but plausibly motivated by some other cultural factors. 
Because even if Trump is an idiot, Putin certainly is not. 
When I say standards, I mean to govt standards for school accreditation. Private, public, and charter schools all must have their students pass some sort of standardized test. When I went to private school this was ERB testing, when in public school it was STAR testing. \n\nIf public schools have a certain curriculum or required set of teaching methodologies that make it harder to teach than charter schools, that is an argument against public schools, not charter schools. 
We want them to hold organizations allowing violence accountable. 
To advance Gods Kingdom on earth is a pretty standard saying in Christian circles. It basically just means to improve the lives of ones fellow man. That shouldn't terrify you; lots of people in America (big Reddit) talk like that. \n\nAgain, I'm not saying that everyone in America or even Dems in congress, are calling apathetic, dumb, or super religious, but people on reddit. I had previously seen some high rated threads on atheism, politics, and news. Obviously those aren't indicative of most people, or even most people on Reddit. That's just the attacks I've seen recently and most publicly. 
This is such a losing argument. Moderates will be hard pressed to understand why their state tax dollars should be used to defend practices defying federal law to protect illegal immigrants. 
Teachers unions are destroying our public schools. Plain and simple. Lots of parents believe it, and the teachers unions know it too, or they would lobby so fervently against non-unionized labor in charter schools. \n\nHomeschooling produces the same results at a lower cost; it is not unreasonable for Sec of Education to want to find a cheaper method of educating children,,\n\nSeparation of church and state is not establishment of religion. Very distinct concepts. I can admit you are right that DeVos believes religious schools are better than public schools, largely because they are. If DeVos starts saying "only Christian schools get voucher coupons", I'll protest right next to you. Until then, the voucher program is not an establishment of one religion over another. 
oh, goodness, I needed that laugh.  Thank you!
I literally just described why there is. Im an atheist, and while I'm not completely pro-life, I can at least understand their argument.\n\nMaybe you should explain why a zygote is not a human being, or when a zygote becomes a human being. 
She wants money that has been allocated to educate children to be put in the hands of families who will decide how to educate children. Public, private, charter, parochial. Don't be insipid and argue that the only job of a secretary of education is to further grow the strength of the federal government. 
When we had that 5% rally after Trumps election I remember people saying "well it's because all of those big industries he's deregulating, it's not like he's actually creating growth". Honestly, strong market growth helps everyone, and you'll be hard pressed to find someone who cares More about outdated regulations that money in their pocket.\n\nNational Review ran a great piece the other day about how if Trump can achieve 4% GDP growth he will be cemented in his current position for 8 years. If he delivers on his promise to cut taxes and regulations, we might see that fabled 7% growth at which point the pussies at the NPS better start prepping Mt. Rushmore for a 5th head. 
Exactly. Rubios questions were terribly miscalculating. Trying to make a future SoS go on record against Putin before even taking office is a bad move. Rubio hoped in would back Tillerson in to a corner, but it ended with Rubio coming across the fool. 
This article by National Review is a pretty good explanation of what conservatives think of Betsy DeVos. In my opinion she's a smart, religious woman who has mainstream conservative views on education reform, namely charter schools, voucher system, and decreasing the strength of teachers unions. \n\nhttp://www.nationalreview.com/article/443931/betsy-devos-school-choice-reforms-help-american-families\n\nAll in all, she's going to suffer the insane hyperbole that has been levied at every Trump cabinet pick. In this case, it looks like they are going to attack her intelligence, compassion, and her belief in God. 
Sounds like you love the idea of big corporations keeping down little companies. \n\nAlso sounds like you don't want her to hire 2 more people. Hopefully Bernie can come out good on those two unemployed people's table. 
Rick Perry is the former governor of Texas, which, in addition to producing a large amount of oil and gas, also houses the Pantex Plant (and several other nuclear facilities) which deals with dismantling old nuclear warheads. \n\nTexas is also the only state in the union with its own electrical grid, giving him far more experience managing energy distribution than any other governor. \n\nPerry is skilled at negotiation and has knowledge of the machine that he is supposed to fix. He is just as qualified as anyone Obama picked. In fact, knowledge of how nuclear energy is made doesn't really qualify you to figure out how to make it a public works project. \n\nI'd argue Perry is one of the most qualified members of Trumps team. For a more in depth read, check out this article. \n\nhttp://www.nationalreview.com/article/444024/rick-perry-new-york-times-hit-job-perry-fake-news
No. Im arguing letting the govt take funds by force is a basis of our society. Letting it take our blood and organs is not. 
Source? The data I've seen points to ~70% of shooters being white, which is in line with their population percentage. 
If you say that Buzzfeed might have been okay to do that, you're wrong. 
Can you tell me why that is? National Review and Ben Shapiro have given fairly strong endorsements of her. I keep seeing people say she's incompetent but never back it up
7+% since Trump's election. That's not nothing. 
I am obstinate and unyielding on this argument because it is a moral argument. \n\nIf you said that Down syndrome children have extra chromosomes and therefore aren't full humans and we can kill them, I would oppose you. If you said that mentally challenged kids have sub-human brain activity and we can kill them, I would oppose you. If you say elderly people who require expensive medical procedures are unable to survive on their own and should therefore be let to die, I would oppose you. \n\nIf you came to me arguing that black people are subhuman, I would not give you the respect of debate because it is not worthy. You can say, well look there is an argument because x, y, and z, but it is unproductive and immoral to elevate someone's ideas of defining away humanity in order to commit evil acts. \n\nSo no, it is not insane to refuse to argue with people on moral grounds. It is immoral to dignify people who celebrate abortion as if removing a fetus is the same as removing a tumor. 
Yes, it is big companies keeping down small companies. The current law allows for big companies that have significant economies of scale to follow the law, while small companies (50 is comparably small) cannot grow to become profitable enough to easily provide insurance. 
And he is an anti-Semite with a Jewish daughter! And pence/Putin/bannon is controlling him! And he really hates gay people like all New York 1%ers do! 
There's an even bigger problem too, in the assimilation of children. We've seen multiple times in the US and Europe that it is not the immigrants/refugees that cause problems, but their children. And once the children are born in America, you can't get rid of them. In America,  <1% of the population commits 6% of terrorist acts (using the loosest definition of terrorism) with an even greater share of deaths from terrorism. \n\nThis is a very real threat that should not be ignored.
So republicans win because more people vote for republicans? \n\nGeez, democracy sure has failed. 
If that were true, you would have seen democratic senators, governors, and representatives switch from Democrat to Republican. This didn't happen. The same democrats that were pro-segregation in the 1960s remained democrats until they were rightly elected out of office. 
Romani Gypsy. They are half gypsy on their mothers side. Irish on their fathers side. Their maternal grandfather was a highly ranked gypsy. 
Wouldn't you rather have someone who knows what the system should look like, than someone who knows how it looks right now? \n\nI agree it would be better she had knowledge of the system, but it is not a major deal-breaker. 
He's not wrong. Saudi Arabia is a piece of shit, but it at least helps the US and has been relatively friendly to Israel lately. Iran is semi-openly pursuing nuclear capabilities while funding terrorism in Palestine. Iranian aggression must be met with strength. They must be brought back to pre-Obama influence. 
If a group of university of Alabama students break windows and threaten Michael Moor with violence, while the university PD stand back and only quell the violence after Moor's life was threatened, then yeah, I'll support pulling funds. Failing to ensure the safety of students and guests is a failure of management, and federal funds should not go to such an irresponsible organizations. 
I've addressed that somewhere else. The separation of church and state (first of all, not in our constitution anywhere, I believe it is in a letter Jefferson writes after the constitution in signed) is not the first amendment. The first amendment is specifically about congress not making laws "establishing" religion, meaning that the govt can't favor one religion over another. In other words, the government can fund religious schools (government gives out grants and small scholarships to private Christian colleges all the time), it just can't only fund say, Presbyterian colleges, and not Baptist schools. \n\nObviously you probably don't share my opinion, but it's not as simple as you make it seem. It's not "separation of church and state" duh. It is a complex question courts have been dealing with for years. \n\nFurther reading (from a source you're inclined to agree with) \n\nhttps://www.au.org/church-state/november-2001-church-state/featured/government-aid-and-religious-schools
No matter what side of the political spectrum you fall on, there can be little debate that Trump's promise to repeal regulations and cut taxes on businesses are spurring this rise.
That's what shocks me so much about people saying the debate was close. Sanders looked spooked, he was fighting, he had long pauses before several of his responses. Hell, you could look at it on mute and land know that Bernie knew he was on the ropes
So she had a bad interview? Did you watch the whole thing? She had some problems in some areas but her job isn't to improve the current system, but to build a new system. 
So Mexicans get food at a lower cost subsidized by American tax payers? 
https://www.google.co.uk/amp/www.usnews.com/opinion/economic-intelligence/2015/09/14/regulations-kill-jobs-data-show%3Fcontext%3Damp?client=safari\n\nThere's lots of other sources, and you can go to the IQ2 website to find debates on this topic. National Review has some good articles on this subject too. 
Nah, fuck that. \n\nJk, our environmental regulations are beyond cumbersome tho. Bloated federal regulations are costing more money than they are worth, and actually cost more lives than they save. 
I actually didnt claim my answer is the only correct one. I claimed that there is only one argument that makes sense in legal, philosophical, and scientific frames. I'll have a discussion about whether the mother's bodily autonomy trump's the unborn's right to life. I will not discuss it with someone who claims a fetus is just a clump of cells no different from an appendix, which is scientifically and philosophically wrong.  
If National Review, Mitt Romney, Trump, and Cruz can't convince you she's a good idea, then hopefully the apoplectic response of the teachers unions will show that this woman is what is needed to address America's failing public schools. 
Pretty simple explanation. Charter schools, public schools, and parochial schools all have to adhere to a standard level of education. After all, you're not complaining that kids from catholic school right now are irredeemably religious nut jobs. The simple fact is that many parents believe that religious schools do a good job at educating children, better than a public school. \n\nI understand your complaint about religious schools receiving tax dollars, but you're forgetting where taxes come from and why we allow them to be spent on children. As a country, we have decided that each child, poor or rich, deserves education up until roughy age 18. We have agreed that we will take money from everyone in order to pay for that education. So each child has a certain dollar figure attached to them, depending on state, county, and city they live in. That dollar figure is allocated to educate the child. If the child could be educated in a catholic school, or Muslim school, or Islamic schools, why should they have to forgo their right to have a subsidized education? It is their birthright to have an  education mostly paid for by the government. So if the parents feel that an Islamic school that meets the same benchmarks of math, science, and English as a public school is a better option for their child better helps their child succeed, they should be able to pay for that.\n\nAs far as your example about LGBT kids with Christian charter schools go, I think you have a point. However, it is important to remember the world is not, and will never be a perfect place. I argue that a poor gay kid in the inner city or rural Appalachia also faces extreme discrimination. Under the current system, he/she cannot attend a new school (due to districting) that might be more friendly to LGBT issues. 
Philosophically it is a much tougher argument than you made it though. Is being able to survive without another humans help a necessary condition for being a human?  Old people on respirators or who need weekly blood donations cant survive without direct help, should they be allowed to die bc, after all, we have too many people on the planet. If 21 weeks is the earliest a pre-mature baby has survived, then what about 20 weeks and 6 days? At what point does a fetus go from a clump of cells to an unborn baby? Doesn't the fact that it has its own individual DNA mean that it is a human being incipient? The argument that a fetus is just a small group of cells and shouldn't be killed is ridiculous. It has specific, human DNA, and will fight to stay alive. \n\nThere is only one acceptable argument in the abortion debate: a fetus is a human being, but the mother's right to bodily autonomy is more important than the life of the child she carries. \n\nEverything you said was you trying to justify killing someone because you don't think it is a full human. 
It is one of the many ways the measure the market. Typically the DOW Jones has been a reliable gauge of market strength, but it does not encapsulate everything that happens in the market. \n\nEvery new milestone becomes less and less impressive though. From 10,000 to 11,000 was a 10% gain, and was a historic milestone. From 19,000 to 20,000 was historic, yet only a 5.26% gain. \n\nIn general, stock market growth is essential for the majority of Americans' financial wellbeing. Insurance policies, 401ks, annuity programs, and IRAs depend on a growing US stick market. 
I should have been more clear. Using far left sources, only 6% of terrorists are Muslim. This still makes them 6x more likely to be terrorists than the average American. However, if you just go by terrorist attacks that end up killing someone, or the number of deaths from terrorism inspired by Islamic ideology, then you find that radical Islamists are far more deadly than any other group. \n
It's worth mentioning as a detracting point, but this post was about why she's a good pick. People can attack her on her lack of public experience and that is a fine point to make. If you go over to any other threads, (politics, atheism, nottheonion) they aren't making that point. It's all hatred of religion, a comment about guns, and her lack of caring for kids in public schools. All are low level arguments that are more ridicule than debate. \n\nAs far as your point about no public experience goes, I think you have a point, but it's not a disqualification in and of itself. 
Can I try to see if I can change your mind? Playing deviled advocate.\n\nThe idea behind abortion is not whether or not the fetus is alive. That is a philosophical debate and too tenuous to base decisions off of. Abortion is allowed because somebody is using your body without permission. While we can and do prosecute parents for failing to properly provide for their family, we do not force them to donate blood or organs. We do not force people to use their bodies against their will, we do however, force people to pay against their will. \n\nIf abortion were a purely financial decision, we could debate equality, but it is largely a bodily autonomy decision. To conflate the two is disingenuous. 
Does a fetus have rights? Yes. Do those rights trump the mother's right to bodily autonomy? Maybe. \n\nEverything else is an attempt to define away the problem. If you argue that brain waves, or heartbeat, or mental capacity are essential to humanness, then you are arguing the same thing that was argued for slavery in the 1860s, eugenics in the 1910s, and the holocaust in the 1930s. Trying to define away humanness because of some arbitrary definition of what constitutes human life is the root cause of much evil. So the only morally justifiable position to have on the issue is that the necessary condition to humanness is to be a separate, living organism, with human cells. \n\nYou keep on trying to have me admit there is reasonable debate to be had, but if you're arguing with someone who says that removing a fetus is no different than removing a tumor or skin flakes, you're not arguing with someone who is being intellectually honest, and therefore the argument is not worth having. 
I'm not saying Chicago is the third world, but no city in America should allow for the killing of its own citizens without due outrage. We've been numb to the horrors of Chicago for years, but if you believe that all lives matter, we can't just accept the rampant crime. Rahm Emanuel has been derelict in his duty, and needs to restore order. \n\nIf 2700 people were dying from tornadoes in Oklahoma every year, I doubt there would be protests about FIMA being used. 
Good points. Why did Trump support Romney in 2012. Certainly Romney was an adversary of Putin. Why did Putins puppet support a candidate who was highly critical of Putin?
Since you're going to try to ignore the point:\n\nThe government guarantees freedom of the press. Should they be required to supply printing presses, paper, or computers to the New York Times. \n\nAmerica was founded on negative rights. 
Seizing funds is not an issue of bodily autonomy. You are misunderstanding what the term means.\n\nA cavity search is not a violation of bodily autonomy. It is a privacy issue perhaps, or a 4th amendment issue, but not a bodily autonomy issue. \n\nYour last point about court ordered medical procedures is relevant. I personally think that a court ordered procedure is a ridiculous affront to human rights. 
There is talk that they will be using Rand Paul's solution, which is namely an expansion of HSAs.
Pretty horrible statement you just made to be honest. Many conservatives, myself included, advocate for more access to birth control (I personally believe that it should be paid for through Medicaid). However, your statement is not that we should encourage women and men to have less children (which is a bad idea because almost all capitalist economies require a growing population to increase real estate value, purchase goods, and supply labor) but that we kill unborn children in the womb. \n\nPretty horrific statement. We need children and we certainly shouldn't kill the unborn just because you cant be inconvenienced with caring for them. 
I'm with you. Listening to Dershowitz, among other 80s-90s era liberals is a breath of fresh air. We disagree on how to best solve problems, but at least we see the same problems. Ellison and Sanders don't even see reality. 
Fake news is information that is false or misleading. If you defend Buzzfeed publishing an unverified dossier as "real news" then you are beyond hope. \n\nLol at real news being in print when you said NPR is unbiased news. 
2700 murders. Even if everyone being killed were a gang member (they're not) do we just allow a war in the poorest neighborhoods because we are so apathetic? 
If Hamas attacks the American embassy in Israel under president Trump, they better buckle up because they full force of IDF and The Navy Seals is crashing down on them. 
If you want to say that followers of radical Islam and western militaries kill equivalently, or even that western militaries kill more, I won't challenge that. However, not all violence is terrorism. Targeted raids on Al Qaeda strongholds, directed drone strikes against ISiS convoys, those are military engagements with a paramilitary force. Killing someone before they kill you is not evil. \n\nShooting up a nightclub of homosexuals is evil. \n\nTrying to conflate military operations with terrorism is a scummy thing to do.
6x more likely than their population would be expected to have is pretty bad. Further, the estimates that I put are the non-controversial data. If you actually examine the data you can find that certain incidents that could be classified as terrorism are not. A lot of the terrorist activities reported are incidents of property damage, not physical violence. Using the same source I linked to in another comment, 94% of terrorism deaths in the past decade have been caused by Islamic extremism. 
I have the right of free speech. Does the government have to supply me with paper and pen? 
The racial gap in school shootings is almost nonexistent. Blacks, whites, and Asians commit these atrocities at rates about equal to their population size. \nhttps://www.statista.com/statistics/476456/mass-shootings-in-the-us-by-shooter-s-race/\n\nSo yes, the group most likely to produce a school shooter is white men, but not disproportionately. However, there is no gap (despite the narrative) to suggest that white men are more likely to be school shooters than black or Asian men. \n\nThe question we need to ask ourselves as a society is why so many young men (regardless of race) become school shooters. Perhaps men as a group need some help?
People have biases. I am sure Blizz takes feedback into account, but it's not the only thing that they use to determine what is good for the game. I am sure they looked at Stats and found no gross misuse in Bastions buffs and felt they were fine for the complete game. 
But Bastion isn't exclusive to a single side. Both sides can pick him. So pick him. 
Its funny because almost anyone in the security sector will tell you that "classified" documents are only ever classified because those in power don't want the people to know the shady things that happened while they were in power. Almost none of it has to do with undercover agents who's lives will be at risk, or something like that. \n\nTrump is obvious hypocrisy, and we should do something. We should also know that this corruption will continue unless we organize to make sure it doesn't happen again, because it will.
So essentially the portable version is the Wii U version?\n\nThat's what it looks like to me.
https://m.popkey.co/ca7ae7/X1RKe.gif
Yeah, but it's winter. 
Here is an idea, with schools and healthcare I don't so much care about "choice" as I care about quality for the masses. If all schools had great funding, and therefore brought in great teachers, and we focused less on standardized testing and homework and more on actual learning then it would not matter to have "choice." 
Also, Torb currently has like 7 counters, so I don't see why leveling the playing field for one would be such a problem. 
One, don't assume Bastion's gender. Bastion can be a good boi or a sweet gurl, we don't know.\n\nTwo, talking like this is like thinking about Bastion and the game as a whole in a vaccuum. In ACTUAL situations, Bastion dies all the time. Bastion is clearly changing the way people play the game, but I have yet to be convinced that this change is unfair in favor of Bastions. People complained with D.Va. People complained when  they introduced Sombra. People complained with Symmetra. People complained about Bastion at Overwatch's release, yet counters were quickly found. \n\nLets let the change simmer for a while, then see how it's actually effecting the meta game for EVERYONE, not just the top players.
Is it not true? Because I think you will be hard pressed to make that argument. 
Dang.\n\nI am reading Understanding Power by Noam Chomsky right now, and the [footnotes are 449 pages long.](http://understandingpower.com/files/AllChaps.pdf)
Yes, and a tablet. \n\nCan it play games with dedicated controllers?\nYes\n\nDoes it have capacitive touch capabilities and wifi connectivity?\nYes\n\nIt's a console. It's a tablet. I don't know why we are arguing semantics.

And how did the become obese? Like, my grandparents moved in their youth as much as I do now, yet they aren't overweight like I am.
The majority of people have only had 1 day with it. I LOVE this update. I don't get the gripes. I have had no trouble killing bastion. 
I had this idea a while back. People said it couldn't be done. \n\nLOOK AT ME NOW!!!!!
Agreed. So do we eliminate sugar from common foods? I mean, your average person has no clue how much sugar is in foods that are labled "healthy" by marketing teams.
I don't give a shit if a Seal said it. I don't care that he killed Bin Laden without a trial (democracy?). Trump is using the government in the corrupt way it has always been. We have not been a democracy for some time. America doesn't care about democracy. 
I totally agree on the sugar thing. That much is certain. Sugar is THE killer in our food supply right now and anyone that says otherwise does not understand the science behind it or they stand to benefit from it's proliferation. \n\nI don't know if we can generalize Americans as lazy. The richest nation on the planet that still works 40+ hours a week and has no guaranteed vacation days SURELY isn't lazy. People clearly want to do something about their weight, look at any gym on January 2. The problem is that exercise is not, as I have come to understand it, the way to lose weight. Diet alone will do 80% of the weight loss work for people. Exercise is wholly good, but it's not the means by which weight is lost. I mean, if you take a person who is overweight an put them on the currently accepted diet, that person will restrict calories. Believing also that exercise is the key to losing weight, this calorie restricted person will now feel in excess of hunger because of the exercise. They are doomed to fail such a lifestyle, and will conclude that they just don't have to will power. But people living in the 1950's didn't need "willpower" to stay fit. Hell, people back then didn't even exercise regularly. I mean, we have babys being born today that are considered obese and pre-diabetic. Are they lazy? I understand why we would come to the lazy conclusion, but I think its the wrong conclusion. 
True, I didn't think of that
Fallout 4 was great! I am excited to see what this studio is cooking up!
Awesome! Thanks for the feedback
I think Americans, overall, respond better to the larger version of Nintendo products. I think lots of people are going to dislike the Switch simply because of the Joy-con size, not necessarily the screen size. But, I am just speculating, so I could be wrong. 
Justice will be done!
Of course these changes aren't "normal" they just happened. It is only considered normal when it has been that way for some time. CLEARLY Blizzard was trying to make Bastion less situational, and that, I think, has been achieved. \n\nGive it time people. Shit. It's been ONE DAY. It's going to take some time to figure out counters. If the enemy team has a Bastion, why can't yours?
And Blizzard didn't find that players feedback did not accurately represent the stats. Also, the majority of players DON'T play on the PTR. Hell, console players don't even have that option. \n\nIf he had been game breaking during the PTR, I doubt Blizz would have let it through. I think people are confusing "game changing" with "game breaking." 
Even if I tripled my fruit and veggie intake, if I still consumed the products available on the market, then I would see little difference. 
"Pretty much what everyone is saying, I think Ironclad is one of the worst things the Overwatch team has ever thought up, but I offer an alternative that I truly believe will fix the problem."\n\nEveryone is NOT saying that. A lot of people are, but a lot of people aren't.\n\n"Remember the shield that Bastion had during development? The one that was removed because it was extremely overpowered, only to be replaced with Ironclad, which is essentially the same thing? I want that back."\n\nWhat? It wasn't replaced by Ironclad! We haven't seen the shield since EARLY BETA, that was OVER A YEAR AGO. Ironclad was implemented yesterday. Your statement is misleading.\n\n"What obviously has happened is that Bastion now effectively has the highest health in the game, while being able to heal himself and deal the highest DPS in the game."\n\nProof? Bastion has NO WHERE NEAR the biggest health pool in the game. Far from it. I am really curious to see how you got that idea.\n\n"Solution? Remove Ironclad, replace the heal with his original barrier shield. However, make it so that he cannot shoot while the shield is active."\n\nSo make him D.Va without the ability to move? I hardly think that's elegant. \n\nThis also gives Bastion the weakness he currently doesn't have: concentrated fire. Ironclad with a healer makes Bastion extremely difficult to stop. Two people both firing at once would put him in a dangerous position, encouraging good teamwork and positioning, rather than "heal me and hope I live" of the current mechanics."\n\nI mean, the way you stop ANY character is by concentrating fire on them. I don't see how that's the solution. In fact, thats what people are complaining that they are having to do. It is NOT imbalanced if a Bastion is incredibly strong with Mercy healing him. Every character in the game gains a huge advantage if they have a Mercy. A Zarya + Mercy is fucking INSANE, but no one is complaining about that.  If Bastion has no healer, he is harder to kill, sure, but not impossible. 
But we certainly must begin.
I mean, all we would be doing is bringing the damage back to PC levels. 
I never insulted you, so why insult me?\n\nCounter my argument, and try not to make judgments on my character. 
This does not prove that these foods aren't bad for you. This doesn't prove anything. 
I LIKE IRONCLAD.
I think the thing that we **really** need to do is stop talking about comps and heroes as if they exist in a vaccuum.\n\n "The only way to kill a bastion is to fullly commit as a team."\n\nThat can be true, but only if the other team is coordinating well. I have played numerous games as Bastion since the update (not the PTR) where I simply could not get any kills.  \n\nI do agree that he is OP, but advocating a nerf simply because he is being played a lot is, I think, a bad reason to do so. Symmetra was **useless** before her update, and now there is one at least every other game. The first few weeks after her update, both teams *seemed* to play her every game, but even that has calmed down.\n\nI say we see how this all plays out once the newest PTR changes hit the game. The sample size in the PTR is, as has been stated before by the Overwatch team, not nearly big enough, and so we can truly see how this plays out when it is in everyone's hands. 
I have no problem killing Pharah's on console. McCree MELTS ANY Pharah if you are good enough. 
My parents used to be the same way. My brother once talked shit about Glenn Beck. Well, we almost got into a serious accident on the freeway because his (my brother) comment sent my dad OFF. A few years later, my sister came out as a lesbian and my family had to rethink their values because it was either 1) my sister is wrong and is choosing homosexuality (their logic) 2) or they (my parents) are wrong. They chose the later, which has also caused their political opinions to change. My Mom went from Tea Party rallies to lobbying Washington for LGBT rights in a matter of 5 years. 
Agreed. \n\nIf the pulse bomb does damage, is it wasted?
I am NOT a Trump supporter by any means, by this sort of post from EITHER side is REALLY annoying and doesn't fucking do anyone any good. 
What is the likelihood that the UK splits in the next few years?
We should probably ban added sugar in America. It's killing us.
True. 
I have seen quite a few Rezs since the patch that have been game changing like I have not seen in some time. It's stressful and I love it. 
But the system before was broken, no? I don't think getting rid of something fixes a problem like healthcare.
I swore I read this headline a few months ago. 
But you have no evidence that they didn't factor player feedback into his changes. Blizzard has a VERY GOOD track record with listening to it's player base. I don't know why that would suddenly change. 
Which is bad? I don't see that as being bad. Widow, Hanzo, Reaper, Junkrat, Zarya, Soldier 76 and Pharah all counter him. I don't see why putting one character into neutral would be a bad thing. De-nerfing Torb does not mean he suddenly counters Pharah. 
Hardly. I still haven't heard a good counter to that argument, you have just deflected it. 
I wish I had the ability to rate matches like on PC. I also wish the spray wheel was less frustrating to use on console. But overall it is the best game that I own to date. It is this generations Halo 3 IMO.
But how can we account for children who are born pre-diabetic and obese? Are they less active and eat higher calories?
No, we cannot agree to that. I will not meet these unfounded demands. I will not comply.
Rep Jason Chaffetz R-UT is the same guy who tried to sell of millions of acres of public land. Fuck that asshole. 
I think you should learn how to counter his new usefulness before demanding a nerf. It's been a day, let's try not to fly off the handle. \n\nAll the games are going to include bastion for a while because HE WAS JUST UPDATED. This happens with every buff.\n\nAlso, lets not forget that the old counter to Bastion was to simply figure out where he is and FUCK HIM UP. Now it involves skill to kill him. 
How do we get people to demand that?
Cut military and give it to healthcare and education for the people. "No, we can't do that, it's unconstitutional and stifles the free market!"\n\nTake away social programs to boost the budget that is beyond the largest in the world for "the general defense" because "We have to do it to protect ourselves from Isis!"\n\nThe threat of terrorism is not great enough, nay, it will NEVER be great enough, for the US to not have a Universal Healthcare and fantastic education.

Ok, well he isn't broken because a Mercy is doing her job. Mercy + anyone is difficult to counter, but it isn't the fault of Bastion that she heals him. Bastion with no Mercy is CERTAINLY easy to kill if you are competent with Tracer. And a Mercy Bastion combo is not guaranteed, as any sample size from a single day of play is not nearly large enough to represent the facts accurately. 
The statistics you post are misleading. \n\nYes, Symmetra has the highest winrate of any character, in quickplay. This is largely because, per game, there is only one defensive side and one offensive side, unlike comp where both teams take both roles over the course of the entire match. Symmetra is a strong defense character, which makes sense, but game maps often put the favor in the hands of the defenders. This is why Hanamura, and Temple of Anubis are often lost for the attackers. The second point will ALWAYS favor them. \n\nI agree that Symmetra is becoming a bit OP, but she is still pretty situational. 
Do you think that Charter schools should act as a basis for implementation into the public space? Or are charter schools the way to go in your opinion?
Americans suddenly outraged at the idea that our election was rigged, when we have rigged so many foreign elections in the last century.
In under a nanosecond.\n\nPlease dude, try exaggerating a bit harder. \n\nYou paint Bastion as some sort of invincible being. He isn't. \n\nIs Bastion harder to kill than before? Yes. So what.
It's strange that the Roots are doing the music for the next game. I think I might have to it out for this reason!

[Ripped a comment from a Guardian article from 2015?](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/mar/10/horror-of-isis-child-soldiers-state-of-terror#comment-48689835)
I listen to a podcast hosted by an ex Navy SEAL called Jocko Podcast. One of Jocko's core principles is that you take ownership of every aspect of your life, specially if you are a leader. Trump needs to take responsibilities for his failures. 
Patch Notes - 3/2/2017\n\n**General**\n\nFixed a bug where teammates would get on the payload.*\n\n**Since Overwatch was in early development we wanted the payload to be something that people not only didn't utilize, but we wanted them to never even know it was there. It has been a core concept of the game to the team here at Blizzard. This update allows u/TavishDeGroot1 to hate his teammates at full power for the duration of the game, which we have found during play testing to feel really nice, and we think you will enjoy it too.*
Not going to happen.
Right. It snows upside-down.
If the meta is broken, which I am not convinced it is, nerfing Bastion is not the only route. I may take that, but it may also take buffing other heroes. Blizzard wants Bastion to play this way, if they didn't they would have left him alone. Balance changes take a while, and eventually this too will be solved, but I don't think it will be solved how people on reddit right now are vouching for. 
Ughhhh....
Lol, my thoughts exactly
I am not saying that. I think the people need to realize when their government is being hypocritical. 
I am arguing because I disagree with you. \n\nIf it was so obvious, why did I have to say it?\n
I would argue that because american parents both work 40 hours a week, no one has time to cook. You could cook, sure, but given prepared over non-prepared why would you choose the later when we already have such little freetime to do anything else. Not only that, but people were never taught how to cook. In fact, people choose ready made meals so that they can go to the gym. Those gym bars are loaded with sugar, yet they are marketed as healthy. 
I mean, two of the videos on the fornt page of r/videos were from either Ice Cube or Charlie Day, which isn't odd considering that they have a movie coming out soon together, and both videos are of them promoting it. 
Do you think they would buff a character to the point that it is game breaking, given the stats they have access to?
It's been ONE DAY. ONE DAY. Give it some time.
I feel like I read the same headlines everyday. Didn't he say this a while ago?
They said they are going to add custom names for games on console.
As an American, I wish this was how our political headlines looked like.
I do believe sugar is directly linked to diabetes, obesity and neurological conditions like Alzheimer's. I think we need to move forward on legislation that limits sugars access in our food. 
So why are a record number of Americans and people all over the world still fat? 
uhhhh, yeah.  Mortal sin = no communion. That's how it works.  I learned that in second grade...\n\nIt amazes me that so many Catholics decide to not even choose to follow basic teachings
I think it's impossible to argue for common sense when people's understanding of diet has been shaped by the USDA and the sugar industry. \n\nThat's the thing though, do people know that they are eating shit? Take fruit juice for example, it is thought of as being a healthy alternative to sodas because of its vitamin content, yet it has nearly as much sugar, with sugar of course being the main driver of obesity. I mean Americans are eating essentially what they were taught to eat in school. Pizza, fruit salad, bagel pizza, lasagna, ribwhiches, etc. (these are all items I was served at school growing up.) \n\n"If someone doesn't value themselves, let them suffer."\n\n35% of American adults are obese. The vast majority of them value themselves. Yet, the rates keep going up. It's not a problem of the individual, it's a systematic problem. If everyone drove the same car, and 35% of the cars began to break down with that percentage increasing every year, we wouldn't argue that the drivers are all to blame. 
What an empty statement that is.
Bill,\n\nYou mentioned in a previous post about needing to solve big problems like diabetes, obesity, etc. Don't we already know the main causes of this to be sugar?

I guess I just don't see it the way you do. Pharah is formidable, certainly. That is do to the fact that no other hero occupy's the same space. I think a potential fix would be to bring Torbjorn's turret damage back. No Pharah fears a Torbjorn currently, but reintroducing his ACTUAL damage certainly would. That, or more people need to play Widow. 
Robots are the future of freeing humanity from wage slavery, but only if we fight to make that true.
I think they should add small health packs to Echo Point Antarctica. This would encourage people to play characters who can't self heal. It might also encourage Sombra, but that's just something we have to live with now.

If I do nothing but play overwatch till the 21, do you think I can reach diamond?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!\n\n
I mean, when you describe any heroes abilities they sound OP in a vaccuum.\n\nFor example, Reaper:\n\n* **Two shotguns** with **infinite ammo**\n* **Can teleport nearly undetected** to **any** point on a map\n* Can, at will, **become invincible**, escaping any danger or harm\n* **Self heals** from **all** enemy dead corpses\n* Can unleash an ultimate that **KILLS EVERYONE** immediately around him \n\nWHAT? HOW OP?\n\nSure, on paper he sounds OP, but we know from ACTUALLY playing as Reaper that he is not.\n\nBastion, used to be nearly useless. Now, he is viable. I think we should not be so reactionary.

This thing called "brain fog" clears up.  It's easier to focus and you retain information from lectures more.  You'll find that you're posture naturally increases.  The coolest in my opinion (and I can't explain it), not fapping builds up sexual energy, and your body must give off something when it's got all that energy in it.

Hey man, welcome to r/Catholicm!  Grab a drink (water!) and kick back\n\nI would encourage you to go to Catholic Answers YouTube channel.  They host a radio show every night where atheists, Catholics, and members of other religions call in with questions about the Catholic faith.  After the show, they post some questions and answers on YouTube.  \n\nIf you have some money to spare, I would recommend picking up the book *Answering Atheism* by Trent Horn.  Trent is a convert to the Catholic faith and is probably one of the wisest Catholics out there.\n\nOf all branches of Christianity, I can Catholicism is the most logical.  We integrate scientific discoveries that some other denominations reject.  For example, evolution and the big bang theory are acceptable beliefs in Catholicism, but so many people think the Church teaches 7 days creationism as a doctrine (it doesn't)\n\nPrayers to you, mate!  
I've been looking at the Military Academy for some time now, but Trump may push me over the edge and help me in my decision making

Hey, thanks so much!\n\nCould you ask her on what she plans to do after graduation in terms of service time?  If it's too early for her to decide, that's all right.

there is a lot of anti-Catholic rhetoric spread.  Many protestants would say the Catholics worship Mary and the Saints.  That is not true, for we would be breaking the 1st Commandment.  Remember, it is through the power of God that the Saints and Mary are in heaven, not through their power alone!\n\nIt is no different than asking the pastor at your Sunday service for his prayers.  They intercede for you.  Now, if we accept this logic, the only other obstacle we must face is this question:\n\nAre the saints in heaven aware of what is happening on Earth, thus are they actually able to hear our pleas?\n\nThe answer is yes.  God is the god of the living, not the god of the dead!
Gotta love Kevin.  Even as a devout Roman Catholic, I thought Dogma was great!  I had heard from someone he protested his own movie, but I had never seen this clip
I didn't say Protestants weren't evil.  I said there's nothing evil about being Protestant.  I admit, this statement is a little inaccurate.  I was implying that someone who is born and raised Protestant and has not been informed of the TRUE Catholic Church (only the anti-Catholic rhetoric), they are not held accountable for their ignorance.  It is through no fault of their own that they are not Catholic.  Now, if they were to be fully aware of the true Church teaching and STILL deny the faith, then we have some trouble on our hands

I understand that the Church has not released an official teaching on Genesis 1.  What I was trying to implement was that Catholicism has an authoritative teaching in addition to scripture, not scripture alone, so the individual cannot pick and chose a message that seems appealing to them over the actual message.

[Here's a debate](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOlFEJbRIeo) with Trent Horn in it.  It's a formal debate with opening and closing arguments, cross examinations, etc.  Trent Horn is a devout Roman Catholic apologist (one who defends the faith), but he keeps all religion out of the debate and uses only logic and scientific reason.  I would say that Trent comes out on top against Prof. Cahdwick, but encourage you to watch, as well.

There are two main reasons why Catholics opt out of communion.\n\n1) They are in a state of mortal sin.  St. Paul writes that those who receive Christ in a state of sin subject themselves to Judgment\n\n2) They fast from Communion and offer up their suffering (suffering being "not receiving God") to The Church Suffering (purgatory)\n\nany of these reasons are acceptable, perhaps I am missing another one, I'm not sure\n\nUnless you are partaking in any of these reasons, I don't see why you'd refrain from communion

You're right.  I was taught to call men "sir" and women "mam."  Look at Caitlin Jenner.  Every single cell in his body has 1 X and 1 Y chromosome (except, ironically, his sperm cells).  Thus, he is a man.  He can dress up as a woman and call himself a girl's name, but he's a man

Some people favor net neutrality because it protects them from companies that take advantage of them when there's a monopoly. The problem I have with this, is government intervention is the cause of the problem in the first place. The lack of competition in the ISP market is due to the regulatory mess it is to start an internet company.\n\nRemember: “A government big enough to give you everything you want is a government big enough to take from you everything you have.” \n― Gerald R.

For example, if you're in a helicopter the *distance scaling* would determine how detailed the city would look from above. Since you're not on the ground, you wouldn't need the textures to look amazing. Because the GTA map is so huge, loading all those textures is very consuming on your computer resources and is a waste in my view since you can't really see them anyway.

That isn't quite true. The Democrats decided to stop being racist because they couldn't get elected, so then the racist Dixiecrats broke off from the Democrats.

The problem with state oil companies is that the governments often take too much cash out of them and install bad leaders, leading to poor performance and a lack of capital. For a good example, see Venezuela where the oil terminals are [so decrepit that they're having trouble getting the stuff out of the country](http://foreignpolicy.com/2017/01/26/venezuela-is-so-broke-it-cant-even-export-oil/amp/). However, what conservatives in petro-states like Alberta often don't get is that state-owned oil companies only *generally* suck, and the problems are fixable with sound leadership. National companies that already perform well don't really need to be privatized, and privatization won't make them perform much better.

He'll be a man of great charisma, an unparalleled scholar, a veteran of several wars, and a cyborg. The Maoist World State will fall apart in the 2070s due to mismanagement. There will be decades of cleansing warlordism. When Peter II's faction of robo-Christians is about to fall, Jesus will come and usher in the Millenium.

Little update. I found a cheat where you can order raw materials, have time progress, and cancel, and you get a number of convoys equal to the number of material trading routes you cancel until time progresses again. I used the temporary convoys to evacuate 9 infantry divisions and 4 Dutch Expeditionary Force divisions to Dover. Then the Germans got to Brussels and my remaining 10 Infantry, 1 Motorized, and 5 Dutch divisions on the Continent surrendered. So now I've got 13 divisions, an Air Force, and the Congo, but I'm stuck in Britain because the lend-leases keep coming. So I'd still like to learn how to stop receiving my lend-lease.

Supported Trump. That's enough for these people.
They've got a great sound.
I think his point is that he thinks he was old enough to consent when he was abused. I looked up more information on the subject besides this one clip and it appears he was abused by a pedophile when he was 14 and had relations with a 27 year old when he was 17. Imo he uses the excuse "I knew what I was doing and was able to fully consent" as a way to cope with the fact that he was raped. Nobody likes to think that they were abused and couldn't control what was happening. This is just a theory floating around so who knows if its true. I do know that he is no pedo. He has outed three during his career and has repeated on multiple occasions that the age of consent laws are fine.\n\nTLDR- He was raped, hates to admit it so comes up with excuse for himself. But thats just a theory.
They do already though and thats what has happened. The ladies couldn't hang and they aren't on top tier teams.
I mean men typically have better spacial awareness and hand eye coordination. But its not split, they just suck and group up with other women who also suck and then together they don't go anywhere.

If we are talking business than teachers are probably the worst people you could go to. They rarely have an idea about what their talking about and more often than not don't have actual experience. The best way is to find someone in the industry who is super successful and imitate them or even talk to them about how they did it. Much better than a teacher.\n\nAlso schools don't teach with books like the richest man in Babylon,rich dad poor dad(which would be ironic) and others that legitimately teach good advice rather than a textbook that teaches something 10 years old.

A synonym is Gopnik\n\nBEHOLD!\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qif-Qz7NY48
I'm impressed, buy the company. Release the code royalty free. GJ Volvo.
The difference is probably believability. If you had a Molotov or a torch or something and then said this than you would be arrested for inciting a riot. Also if you had a gun and said lets kill all black people the same would apply.\n\nOf course this is a giant strawman so it doesn't really apply anyway.
Are you really or just continuing the joke?
I like to think every pede is a trans-American. Around the world bad-asses with a hard on for Freedom!
I agree but at least that is completely contained to TD. With these other subs you are force fed it. Its kinda ridiculous the favor shown to them.
I think sweet and savory is amazing and pineapple goes well with almost anything. Fight me.
So hit pieces are slander + power?
I don't see the neckbeard here. Perhaps he uses the hatchet as part of his job? Overall a very low quality post.
Are they really censoring or is it just they are having server problems. I think its probably the later.
It was one of those things that I had heard of before but never looked into so thanks for making me do the legwork and actually getting informed.\n\nAccording to Columbia University this gender dimorphism is because of the way men and women use the right and left hemispheres of our brains. For problem solving men use primarily the left side of our brain(the "logical" side) and women use both equally(including the right "creative" side) This means women are better at reading emotions while men have better hand eye coordination and spatial awareness. Fun fact this is why women are more emotional during arguments and when problems arise and men are calmer more logical(completely on average its mostly down to the individual)\n\nHere is the link sorry for the website quality, it sucks but a uni made it so what do you expect\n\nhttp://www.columbia.edu/itc/anthropology/v1007/jakabovics/mf2.html
Wow both of these people are equally bad. One is an idiot who thinks he deserves sex and the other is an idiot who thinks that calling someone a bunch of names is winning an argument.\n\nBoth assholes really.
The amount of power residing in a EXTREMELY small group of people would be crazy. Look at the EU. They are dictators who create laws to fit themselves. The definition of  elites. There is no way of creating a successful global government because of the power that would reside in a few people. This would easily result in fascism and ultimately suck.
99% sure it was a joke about TYT.
I can respect that. Going against the grain.
My biggest question is why? Why are there new tunnels going everywhere they are stupid. Why so much clutter? Why are you creating a million new spots at long to hide and check. Why is CT mid so cluttered and strange. 90% of the decisions made for this map seem to be from " how can I make this different" rather than " how can I make this better"
I was more referring to entrepreneurial courses or small/international businesses. For things like finance, accounting, sales than colleges are amazing. But for starting and running your own business almost completely useless. Thats why people turn to mentors and books(not this fool but actual business owners and successful entrepreneurs.)
Just wait. If Le Pen gets elected then we really will see some fireworks. Stay safe in Paris my friend.
The map I find is to blame for this. Whenever I am on aim botz the game is very inaccurate laggy and hard to be precise. Off the map the game is fine and I start hitting the shots again.
Please no. They were horrible. Even more RNG? yuck no thanks.
And the Sessions is in the court!
I went through it an finished it but I was thrown off when they switched tack and started questioning my religion and opinions of gays. Can't we keep it centered around games?
My friend your talking about the country that practically invented consumerism. When you can get a decent pizza that can be dinner and breakfast the next day its pretty cheap. 
There is nothing free market about schools. This is what happens when Unions take over completely. When teachers can't be fired and they weed out anyone without the same ideology. If you want free market schools look at private schools. The schools have never competed as most of their money comes from the government. Meaning that even if you have twice the students your not really receiving twice the money.
Really I had no idea. I don't remember doing this but maybe I ran an exec that did it for me. Thanks.
Isn't that also the character from the worst starfox game?
I say it. Does that make me weird?
I want to see more that the daily mail say that the report was rushed. They say a "high placed sourced". Thats just as bad as a "Russian ex-KGB". I would like to see proof and this talked about more.
He is what is known as a provocateur. Saying outrageous things that stir people up is his thing. Everyone who knows about him knows that he doesn't mean everything he says. He's an actor with a political point. he says "dumb" stuff to rile up people, this in turn creates controversy which in turn creates more coverage of him which not only makes his underlying point heard but also a makes him a chunk of cash. If your outraged then his job is working. He isn't claiming the joke card you just have to understand his tactics.
Thats a nice gun. Replica or not? Total wild west vibe.
He already told you the hoe. Its his friends Mom.
Probably, I haven't read any but then I'm no expert on middle eastern literature. History is written by the victor but when there is no winners then what?
If you think that Milo defends pedophilia than you are crazier than I realized. The stuff the man says is designed for that. he once said that fat people should stay home and not go to the gym because they disgust him. he's a provocateur. Get your game together OP he's the definition of a red herring.
Joan of Ark is BACK.
I wonder, the islamic cultures were very warlike(if not then they certainly were before). It could have been seen more as another war than terrorism.
Why is this here?
Bagels, they are amazing. Take a cinnamon raisin bagel add some mayonnaise and ham. Its incredible.
I believe that Trump talks about it in The Art of the Deal. Make a semi false statement. Everyone will rail against the falsehood but the point of the message gets far more coverage than it would otherwise.
I agree. But fundamentally its a circle jerk page. Its entire purpose is promotion of Donald Trump. Someplace that Trump supporters can get together spew their thoughts about Trump and leave happy in the knowledge that there are people who agree with them. Half satire and half zeitgeist. In my experience as one who pursues the place occasionally they do a fairly good job of citing sources when they are being "serious" and a horrible job when they "shit post"
So instead of Stormfront or SJW its Politics or ETR. I like this game.
To be honest he did slide straight into that one.
Thats a good one too. I like using some older saying because they are fun to say!
I wouldn't go that far(there are still quite a few bugs, mostly ease of life with a few important like the smoke/molly bug.) Though for sure CSGO is easily the best in terms of netcode and precision ala quake. Though it doesn't always feel like it.
That actually is not true. It doesn't make it "worse" because women are granted the opportunity just like men but simply aren't good enough to make it.  There are also studies that show men have better hand eye coordination, better spacial awareness and better problem solving skills. There is very little to no misogyny in the gaming community especially at the pro levels. If anything its the other way around, women get special treatment, they get their own leagues that are televised with large reward pools and they get large expensive team contracts that they certainly don't deserve. Many men who are far better than these ladies get passed up because they are men and money can be made in advertising women teams and promoting "diversity".
Ever hear about the Hitler one? My grandpa told me that one Crazy old coot said that he killed 6 million Jews! Can you believe that!
5, most practical and useful. Also looks completely badass. Not sure I see the neckbeard but I'll roll with it.
Do you even play games? Maybe some esport games? \n\nSpacial awareness is EXTREMELY important. When you play a game knowing where you are and where your opponents are is a skill not to be underestimated\n\nHand eye coordination- Do you even play games? Like a FPS or MOBA or RTS? The whole game is about hand eye coordination, seeing an enemy and putting your cursor on them. \n\nWomen getting special treatment over men would be misandry not misogyny but thats just semantics so I know what you mean. \n\nThere is no reason that women shouldn't be competing along with men but they simply aren't good enough. In CSGO at least they are some of the worst pro players out there.They also choose(in CSGO at least) to play only in Womens tournaments this means they are rarely challenged to improve and get better.\n\nIn terms of the gaming community being toxic, yeah there are a lot of jerks. We all meet them, we all deal with them. Its not any different from women to men except the insults delivered. People are jerks winners get past them. \n\nTLDR -Women have been offered every opportunity and yet still haven't made it. There are some biological differences that make men better in areas that are very important in gaming.
I am a neckbeard because I disagree with you? Is that what I'm seeing here?
Well that was out of the blue. Why am I misogynistic? I am a fan of gaming yes? Why does this make me a neckbeard?
I really don't have a big problem with this. Battlefield 1 for all intents and purposes is a fantasy game. In many ways its extremely unrealistic and non-historical. To add some diversity in there is not going to break the bank in that regard.\n\nIf they claimed or even tried to be historical then it would be jarring to see a black guy in a German uniform.\n\nOverall not the biggest deal imo. I think people might be overthinking this. It feels like They wanted to improve their market reach. Not pander to sjw's.
My thinking was more, he's at the highest rank of mm his movement must be pretty good.
Your right. Still the both of them are stupid though.
I don't know what you mean by the 3 cities that got attacked but I know that Sweden is having a huge immigration problem. Recently Sweden has become the rape capitol of the west(https://www.gatestoneinstitute.org/5195/sweden-rape) and is second in the world of rape per capita. 80% of the crimes reported before 2016 were from immigrants(https://muslimstatistics.wordpress.com/2015/03/19/sweden-77-6-percent-of-all-rapes-in-the-country-committed-by-muslim-males-making-up-2-percent-of-population/). After they made it illegal to mention the race,religion or nationality of the rapist these numbers are unavailable (https://news.vice.com/article/sweden-plans-to-thwart-racism-by-eliminating-the-mention-of-race-from-its-laws). The immigrants are taking close to 6 bil a year(https://www.euractiv.com/section/global-europe/news/sweden-sees-costs-of-migration-crisis-almost-quadruple/) and with less than a thousand getting employed.(http://www.breitbart.com/london/2016/06/01/less-500-163000-migrants-find-jobs-sweden/ )\n\nI think it is extremely truthful to say that Sweden has a HUGE problem with immigrants.\n\n\nBut don't take it from me take it from an actual swede\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y1_viPSD-bY
Wow seems you have a lot of options. Congratulations and good luck!
It's Ash Wednesday this week :( No more bacon except on Fridays.
I would just play it and maybe set some binds for callouts. You'll never be an IGL but you can still play and be fine.
I wish, can you imagine if that was actually how it worked? TD and 4chan would have a field day and just start spamming block on r/politics and other heavily anti Trump subreddits. Its not who is getting filtered but an excuse to filter who the admins want.
I would still for one be more interested in the hero on the left than the guy on the right. But because I am in the minority it doesn't get as much press. That's capitalism, its pays best to pander to the largest paying group possible.
What type? Greco-Roman of something like BJJ?
The article says that religion is against the family unit? I see nothing father from the truth. Overall not a terrible article but that part is truly ludicrous. 
I wish we had this kind of level-headed discussion in r/politics.
My friend you are asking for citations on a shitpost. Just calm down enjoy the meme's and if you really want to know ask in the comments like you did.
Well I mean the Catholic scholars were often on the receiving end of the violence. You'd be a little bitter too if someone burned down your home slaughtered your friends and took your stuff.
What is precisely your point? Just to make sure I understand you.
I don't even know how someone who can't exist without someone helping them can be helped beyond providing a caretaker. The whole point is that they can't become independent and I really don't think loans would help.
I do, I've played since alpha. My go to game for 3 years. I play it less now but thats mostly because the game has slowed down drastically. No new maps, mods, or vanilla content worth looking at. Gives me the biggest nostalgia trip to play it again but I get quickly bored.
Incredibly successful, leads an active social life, has a boyfriend, no neckbeard, very fit.\n\nI'm not seeing it. If we classified people as neckbeards because they said edgy things then you would be top of the list. I mean look at this title.
TLDR- You are correct. its a system to help prevent the banks from, loaning to people who can't afford it.\n\nThe credit system is essentially a nationwide ELO number to determine how safe a risk you are. The more loans you take and pay back the better your score becomes. It also improves if you have assets like houses or other liquidate-able things that in theory the bank could take to recoup losses if you fail to pay the loan.\n\nYour score goes down the more a risk you are. In 2008 we had a major economic crash because banks were loaning large amounts of money to people who can't afford it and who all defaulted(that is refused to pay) on their loans. Since the money isn't really the banks and is actually yours and  mine many people lost their shirts and consumer confidence fell leading to the crash.
Why stop there. World politics is crazy and some people are absolute fanatics. I swear if people don't calm down soon then heads will roll.
Its the victim complex. Everyone uses it on both sides of the line but basically people think they are automatically in the right because they are victims. If someone can complain that the super neo nazi evil white supremacist sub that is TD is taking over reddit then they can feel as if they are the underdog sticking it to the man even if their not. As a fairly neutral person political(at least I like to think I am) its amusing to see this.
I agree the music is a welcome change that I really think we needed.
This is what caused the financial crisis of 2008. Subprime lending. Do these idiots really want that over and over again ad finitum?
I don't know if this is new but I started up a server on local with some bots and it was 128 tick! I tried it again to make sure. Is this new? I know that it was 64 tick before. 128 tick mm confirmed?
I know I will get downvotes for this but..\n\nIsn't this the sort of talk we support your being able to say? Its obviously a joke and even if it was in bad taste shes a nobody. Not a public figure and I really think if we are going to support Milo who says stuff like this all the time then we should support this lady. Even if she disagrees with all we say We should still support her right to say these things without being fired. This just reeks of hypocrisy and that's supposed to be the lefts affliction not ours. I don't care for her religion but she does have the right to say what she wants.
Interesting note about the female one. Women don't compete at anywhere near the level of men. In any game. There is a discussion going on currently about whether its biological, interest or social. Probably all three. But the fact remains that women are very low tier on the totem poll in all esports.
Please don't follow any of this guys advice he is an idiot. There is nothing 1970 about punishing your kid by removing video games. Parents are supposed to teach their children and yes to discipline them. \n\nWhat you want to do is impress them. You want to keep up the good grades and get a good grade on the project. There is nothing that you can do to "fight" back you have to win them over. My parents were the same way with me. All i did was get good grades make friends and keep myself fit and healthy, they got off my back for the most part. The very worst thing you can do is throw a fit. I don't know how old this guy is but from his biogoted reaction I would guess 16, never having kids and being "rebellious" will give you this kind of stupid opinion.\n\nIf you stop school and swimming you will only cost yourself in the long run, they will never give you back the privilege of gaming because you are trying to spite them, believe me I tried. Always remember they are in charge and they need to keep it that way, keep a cool head and talk to your Dad. Make a case for why you should continue gaming. \n\nAlso talk to your teacher, see if you can get an extension on the deadline.\n\nFinally get the project done, show them. Make it an act of sorts to show them how much work you put in. My mother always would be the most pleased if I showed her how I was doing in my classes and made a special effort to show progress.\n\nGood Luck! 
So why is Kanye putting the Confederate flag on his merch anyway? Just because its a cool design? Just curious.
My Dad did this for me with LOTR. His reasoning is that the books are far better and you should get the books down first so you can truly appreciate the movie. It was a good thing to because without that it would have taken me much longer to pick them up and read them.
Well hopefully it lasts another 235,000.....
I always figure that there would be no punishment besides fixing/paying for what they broke. Thats what my dad did.
I would just like to mention that he is NOT a Trump supporter. he just wears the hat to trigger sjw's. Which imo is a perfectly valid reason to wear it. He leans more left than right and is mostly apolitical.(just wanted to clear up any confusion about the hat)
Then I wholeheartedly agree. Though I am not sure about how to go about it.
Congrats man! That's not an easy one to get. IF you don't mind what does someone do with a masters in finance? Do you teach or work in a bank? Or something else entirely?
Their not talking about bhops usually. Mostly peaking/moving around the map. I wouldn't worry about it if your at ge though.
Is this just a opportunity to use a Bane meme? Because not hate for that but are you trying to make a point?
They're named Scum for goodness sakes. Are we sure this is real? Do these people not realize their own acronym? 
How is this calling for a coup? Am I missing something? this seems a bit clickbaity. For instance if I said I prefer capitalism to socialism I'm not calling for a coup in Cuba.
lol
Warren Buffett YOLO'd railroads and shit for a nasty profit. This guy is on his own level.
This isn't even anything new. Media Matters works hard on r/politics and so did Correct the Record. I'm sure r/the_donald had some outside help. r/hailcorporate has been on about this forever.
So... Does this mean it's definitely happening?
I bet you have a real way with the ladies.
Yes.
Milk thistle is BS bro. Not a lick of science indicates it does a damned thing.
>  legally obtained \n\n> hidden audio recordings, video tapes or documents\n\nThat's really difficult. The people who have legal access to internal and legally obtained recordings or documents like that will probably be employees and whistle-blowing like that would probably be a career killer. They could also become a media sensation, though so... I think I'd make sure to hire a good publicist if I were going to do that.
It's most likely to just be a round of tax cuts. Any kind of detailed tax reform looks to be too divisive among the Republicans. That's actually a pretty good article.
It's finally time for me to get in.
I check into a hotel in New Orleans. The valet driver tried to convince me to cheat on my wife with the girl at the front desk, couldn't drive a stick so asked me to park the car myself, got lost trying to help me find my room, and it all culminated in me walking into my room, which was already occupied by a guy who was sitting up in bed in his underwear who jumped when I walked in. We exchanged a few polite "Shit!" and "Fuck!" pleasantries as I ran out and he went to his door to watch me leave.\n\nThat wasn't even the first time I'd stayed there. Definitely the last.\n\nBest part of it all, their "system was down" so I never got a receipt. Checked my card, no charge. New Orleans is weird. 
I've been confused about this. People here on Reddit have made it sound like the FDA had a lot of say in whether it's considered a drug. I'm not familiar with how that all works.
Brother? Is that you? ^^^Are ^^^you ^^^wealthy?
Just found this reddit from "Random" and it's pretty cool.
also
Yea. Thanks.
> I just want something safe with some lean gains.\n\nProtein powder. I'm kind of being an asshole but I'm kind of serious. You're fucking around with your hormones so you get what you get here. If you have a predisposition toward male pattern baldness, you'll get it. Use tamoxifen or clomiphene for PCT and have them on hand during your cycle. You can start early if you see bitch tits.
That's basically what Super PACs and advocacy groups do with /r/politics

"They don't need us to make design improvements, they need us to move them away from the concept of a smart phone (that we hooked them onto) and toward a smart watch and a smart TV and a smart contact lens that will make the smart phone obsolete!"\n\nAnd we're here like, "Yea, but, while you're doing that, can you get the volume control thing out of the way?"\n\nBut they're too busy on the future to move back to 2017 and take care of our problems.
>The billboard belongs to Whiteheart Outdoor Advertising, and owner Bill Whiteheart said the organization that bought the space doesn’t want to be identified.\n\nThat could just be a leftist trolling other leftists.
I was really impressed with him for saying he'd recuse himself from ANY investigation regarding the campaign (not just this issue about the meeting).
Wow. They're practically the same person. I should tweet Oscar an apology.
Still not clear. Please explain.
As a person of Walmart, I resent that.
I've ridden a Greyhound bus a few times. It sounds like you got some odd passengers but my experiences have been pretty tame. People usually keep to themselves. I like the free WiFi (when it's working) but, unlike airlines, you can't buy any drinks. I always bring my own little liquor bottles so it's not a big deal.
I like Spence and I think he has plenty chance to win this fight but get the fuck outta here with that "become the next SRL" bullshit.
"Pay me $5,000 and I'll teach you how to make money in a bull market."
So... It looks like he's going all in on MU.
1-DHEA and 4-DHEA stack up to do some great work.
Stalin looks like he's there because he has to be, not because he enjoys it. Like maybe he thinks Marx is kind of a dick but he hangs with him because everyone else likes Marx and you just have to choose your battles.

He's saying the headline is inaccurate.
Ted Cruz keeps getting better, in my opinion.
I must have missed this chapter in How to Win Friends and Influence People.
What's the best? Best for what? What're you trying to do?
I used to have a black lab and a boxer that were bros (and rivals). The two breeds together must have an awesome personality.
Shit, I held my breath just watching it.
Reading through some of the comments here, I can't help but feel like r/the_donald and r/politics are two sides of the same coin. The two subs just circle jerk in a different direction.
It'll still be necessary but way lower in amount or how often it gets paid out.
Dad? Is that you?

Completely inhumane.
It's a deer only fun size.
I just found this sub by clicking "Random". I think it's the first time I've really seen much of any complaint about Amazon. I had a shitty experience years back selling stuff on there but it seems like there are plenty of people who've had issues with them.
I find it interesting that they see little to no chance of substantial tax reform.
This has got to be one of my favorite knockouts of all time.
Well, we don't have to admit anything. It's stated quite plainly in the article that the person who does know says the client wants to remain anonymous. My speculation arose because, if the client really believes that the man should be the breadwinner and that the woman should be grateful, with the implications that go along with the statement being advertised, what makes them feel the need to pay for a billboard to express that sentiment? Are they trying to win people over to their way of thinking? There seems to be no effort to do that. There is no link to a website for more information, no logo, no attribution, no hashtag, nothing to further any kind of advocacy campaign, no indication of political or religious leanings, and nothing really to indicate that there is a point to the billboard that they probably paid several thousand dollars for. So, yea, this strikes me as suspiciously being equal parts inciteful and pointless. It looks like somebody trolling.
Wanted a boy. Got a girl. Kept my mouth shut about it. Girl was pretty awesome. Am now wrapped around her finger.
I'm not sure what you're talking about but I'm generally against solitary confinement.
People really will argue about anything.
Muhammad Ali was the GOAT because of what he was both inside and outside of the ring. Nobody comes close to what he did for the sport of boxing.
That's pretty unnerving.
That's just *my* lab. Don't be fooled. Not all labs are so strict with their QC.
This is what I came here to say. Seems like the obvious answer.
There's a word for this. Fuck, if I could only think of it.
Her tweets were critical of Zionism. Linda Sarsour is crazy in a lot of ways but she can say something critical of Zionism without it being called anti-Semitic. If you criticized Obama they called you racist. Same thing.

An E46 with an electrical issue!?!  I don't believe you!  
In my defense though my BMW didn't come with any.  
And then the parents that will defend the kid over the teacher.  \n\nWhen my cousin got in trouble in 6th grade my teacher called my aunt in to discuss it.  My aunt noticed the teacher looked really scared and asked her "are you okay?  you seem nervous."  The teacher responded with "well I know what a sensitive topic it is when a kid acts up in class to the parent."   My aunt just replied with "are you kidding?  Let me know anytime my kid is being a shit, and he'll get in trouble at home in addition to whatever you have to do."
The point isn't that lying is okay, the point is the medias double standard for lying.  
So am I and I don't know what half of those terms were.  
Don't forget you can always call the Suicide Hotline at 1-800-273-8255. 
Could she have been saying it as a joke?  Kind of like everyone calling it Crackberry.  \n\nThe real red flag to me is that she left you alone with her mom IN THE FIRST WEEK!  
20 years from now!?  I give it 5 until they push for that.  
So I can tell you what my mom told me.  When I was with my friends in 7th grade some really provocative women came on TV.  Both of my friends had their eyes locked onto the TV.  My mom pointed out to my dad that I wasn't even looking, and from there they always knew but weren't sure until I told them.  \n\nOther than my lack of interest in women I was a pretty normal kid.  Nothing that was a huge red flag.
I am pissed, I want my 8 hours back.

UGH!!! I am 34 and was hoping when I hit 35 I would break 3,000......\n\nAlthough I don't understand what I saw in the gym the other day.  A 34 player with a 2977 Vaporeon.  Mine maxed out at 2954.  
I have this issue and it's a mixture of things.\n\n1) Don't break your weekly sleep cycle on the weekends.  That really hurts you.\n\n2)  I do something to relax before bed, and take some relaxing over the counter sleep aids.  Make sure the room is very dark.\n\n3)  This one might sound stupid, but it really works.  Get a body pillow.  At night I grab onto it it's really soothing.  It's not the same as having a boyfriend, but it's nice.  \n\nObviously results will vary for each person.  These helped me, but and I still don't sleep fantastically, but it's better.
Hell yeah!  Glad to see other alumni!  Sadly last night was not a good night for the Wolfpack..... 
Am I the only one that noticed he's 576 miles away?!
So when I hit level 35 how do I do that?  
I always loved learning about his childhood.  He was always my favorite character as well.  
I've had sex with more than 5 guys this year and you're still gayer than me for driving that car.  
So when I hit level 35 how do I do that?  
Or how fast they always verify it.  "Yeah, we checked on your story and it holds up."  He told you that 30 seconds ago, how did you check it so fast!?
hahaha, fixed.
Even though I didn't agree with him he seemed like such a nice guy.  Sad to see him pass away so young.  
It's not like it was good looking to start with, haha.  
Interesting enough her Mercedes S280 was estimated to be going 105 km/h or a little over 60 mp/h.

I drove the car around the neighborhood with just my learners permit.  I am 27 now and still have never told them.  
Thanks for the tip!
Yeah, but now you have Comcast.  
YES!  It's just the general mentality of those people that think "someone will clean up after me."
Why call them?  Make sure you FaceTime them.  
Before this video, yeah.  
At first I thought it was moldy but then I realized it's supposed to be a pickle.  
Sorry to hear that.  I have an issue getting into reverse once and awhile, but nothing too bad.   When I changed the fluid it seemed fine.  
Everyone in that bar must have had kids.  haha.  I am 27 and had forgotten about that song altogether until this meme. 
Good to know, how many miles did you get out of it?  Mine still seems okay, but the engagement point is definitely high up on the clutch, so I am not sure how much it has left on it....
What CP was your chansey before you did that?
Adam from the first saw movie.  He died because the damn key went down the drain, it wasn't his fault.  
I am assuming it's similar to the NC sweepstakes?  Our machines are programmed to pay out a percentage back.  So if a machine is set to 80% and takes in $1000 it gives back $800 of it.  
That's what I thought too.  Do we have to bitch about everything?  
You ran to NYC?  Wouldn't you have had to leave your phone on your dress for over a day?  haha.  
Thank you!
Awesome, thanks!!
That was my first question as well, are we expecting one?
My 98 civic has the original clutch at 226,300.   \n\nAfter looking at that though, I hope the civic replacement is easier...
Yeah, pretty much.  haha
I did the same thing, I am at 6400 candies and counting.....
Thanks, I have never had Snapchat before.  
I liked the show, but Debra was terrible.  She was always pissed off about something, I don't know how anyone could handle her.  \n\n
They're not scheduled until March 20th, which I think is stupid.  
What pissed me off the most was the amount of gay people defending it and saying "this had nothing to do with a religion."  All my gay friends started coming out to defend it, I had to delete my Facebook after that it was so gross. 
They're starting to pop up around North Carolina now too.  I have two near me.  
That's the very first death scene from the first movie too...........
I have the same issue.  Hell I struggle to fall asleep in my own damn bed.  
Thanks!
I thought you got soft banned for that?  From what I understand you can't just teleport anywhere without getting in some kind of trouble. 
Does it fix the issue of the last message read receipt "unreading" after shutting off iMessage?
What's the main issue that causes them to die?
Don't give him any ideas....
Awesome, thanks!  
It's not even an original idea... they stole it from Steve Harvey.  
Glad I am not the only one.  I need my shirtless selfie to look good.  
You literally have the same car Skyler White bought for Walt Jr and everyone hates that bitch.  
He thinks the missing airplane got sucked into a black hole..... I am going to go with idiot. 
I was half expecting his name saying he liked to "parTy"
Beautiful color, it looks like my earwax.  
The headline on the CNN app is "Trump's top advisers reveal Russia meetings" as if they did something wrong.  
Her entire life went from 100-0 pretty much. 
> Had the granny rebuilt.\n\nPoor grandma.  :(
Shit is about to get real.... Whether this is true or not shit is getting real either way.....
Where was that!?!
This is what should be posted for "not my president."\n\nhttps://imgflip.com/i/1e6u3x\n
I like the guy, but that video was over the top.  Of course this is only going to push him further into the spotlight, something his critics will hate.  
TIL that sub exists.  It's actually pretty funny.  
How did you land on the hood?  Did you have your seatbelt on?  If you didn't, that's amazing you're okay.  
As far as if Jeff Sessions did or didn't talk to Russia .... At this point what difference does it make?  
We do kind of have some sorts of gambling.  We have sweepstakes all over the state, which are "skills based games."  The ALE has tried to shut them down but lost in court many times.   Some states have them and some don't, it just depends on the state. 
Thanks!
that sort of happens when there's no new content. look at subs like /r/PandR & /r/breakingbad.
Artest was a beast defensively and Kawhi could expand his game to as good as all of them.
You've had THE best player for all but 4 years of his career and haven't won one yet. 
I hate flair based comments but A NETS FAN IS SAYING THIS ABOUT THE MAVS?!?!?! The Mavericks have accomplished more in the past 16 years than the Nets have in their entire existence and have never made a trade as horrendous as the Nets made with the Celtics. LMAO.
I... I don't think that's true.
well I'd assume that most years the previous year winner doesn't blow up on the back 9 to give it away. 
Chris Paul is definitely the Vet I want to see get a ring. 
Who? Zaza? he'll be gassed by playoffs most likely and even if he's not he's not going to compete with Favors or Gobert. Durant a non-factor against them.
Does that count the First Strike time warp?
Not amazing quality but at my local Clark's store, most boots have been marked down to 79.99 and the store as a whole is 25% off with an additional 10% when you buy 3 shoes. \n\nsource: work at a local Clark's 
Douglas.
probably a touch limit
Probably referencing a '12-step program' like would be used in the type of addiction meetings that Chip speaks at, and thematically it most likely references that everytime he makes headway in something he sabotages himself. 
absolute madman
eh, I was a little sick of all the respawns in Old World Blues myself
I still believe the Spurs have the better defense this season.
very awesome. 
Great college coach. Probably just an average NFL coach.
Absolutely embarrasing. How does a team go from the semi-finals (and the finals not so long ago) of the WC to not even making the Euros with an expanded field in just a year and a half?
Oh it did. Remember the scandal with the prisoners in Iraq being toyed with? Bush was blamed all up and down for that 
he admitted to showing you those pictures, with prior history, and they kept him around? lol. call awareline and/or district manager. that's ridiculous.
maybe a sand green. I learned about them on /r/golf
was really sad when we lost him.
true.
Philbin doesn't really know how to do either 
'fairly ugly carpet' lol
huge overreaction. no way he'd be out of the league in a year with the start he's had.
he already does a fade away, kind of dirk-esque, which you can see at the beginning of game 7 when he uses it against Andre.
why can't you share them
'went over the back line' \n\nthat's an interesting way of putting it.
I wanna say that historically the far left has been more dangerous but those instances (national socialism in germany, communism in Russia and the Far East) were distortions of what the far left is really supposed to be.
thanks, Kobe
how is it like karma police?
who's better?
considering they do interviews in the show I would assume they know they're being filmed. 
ought to. one of the better RPGs of the last decade. 
ankles 
mhm, how bout them red sox
jealous of those cool grey 4s man
how does the offensive scheme a team runs have anything to do with how their defense works? 
Suns fans get in here.
at that height in college basketball, while lifting is still beneficial, you should also focus in developing your handles, your shooting, and your passing.\n\n\nnot many teams have a guy who can consistently bring the ball up, or a guy who can be trusted to knock down shots, or a guy who can make perfect passes for the assists. be that guy.
disclaimer: this is coming from someone who thinks LeBron is right there too. \n\n\nit took many years for LeBron to get the Cavs to the Finals (successfully) too. 2007, although close, was a sweep not in his favor. it took him 10+ years to get Cleveland to the Finals, he just had some time off in the middle. Had MJ left the Bulls and went to say, the Jazz or something (team with great PG and great PF, similar to LeBron leaving Heat) MJ would have been to the finals just as fast as LeBron.
Westbrook didn't make starter either. The disaster was that players who hadn't played a minute all season were getting votes.
I thought you were saying it only took LeBron a year to get a team to the finals in the context of him leaving the Heat, not joining the league. my bad. still, my point of successfully leading a team to the finals is still there.
Disagree. Kagawa is in stellar form as of late.
and he did.
that's what I thought, so kind of like how it is in FIFA? It's not a bad idea in theory, but since timing is such a big part of football, it wouldn't be a good idea I think if the seconds on the clock were moving faster or slower than they are in reality.
Curry guarding JR is going to be like almost any other player guarding Curry. 3 point bonanza
until level 50
so much better ♡
pretty sure we did, we just didn't allow there to be a buy-out clause and his agent got fussy.
nice bag
You can play for whoever you want U-23 and below, AFAIK. Once you make a single appearance for the actual senior team you are officially locked in.
maybe, idk. the rap/hip hop comparison just reminded me of his Twitter and articles.
Standard, 2 RB, No Flex, 12-team\n\nJ. Hill\n\nG. Bernard \n\nD. Johnson\n\nM. Forte\n\nwhich ones???\n
it's been a long time haha
Lucian too.
in Ardmore? damn
sand greens?????
14 team standard. \n\nEnunwa (vs SEA) or Diggs  (vs NYG)
Can you explain what you mean by the 15 minute thing?
only a few schools do the shell drill? weird. my intramural community college coach did the shell drill lol.
standard scoring:\n\n\nHill vs. Pit / Bernard vs. Pit / Woodhead vs. Bal / Forte vs. Min / DMC vs. Sea \n\n\npls help
"Club" should replace about half of the "golf" in there.
would have last year. Dez Caught It.
I would say City's was far more difficult with Borussia tbh
would still rather start Robes over Waiters.
they changed NBA to have player voting this year and it was a disaster. 
I disagree. Seahawks had sort of the same issue with Harvin (I realize he had locker room issues in addition). Patterson simply isn't good enough to have entire plays created for him, at least to me.
Seattle Sounders played LA Galaxy two nights ago.
Ramsey probably didn't deserve to be ejected but it was more than a little shoving on the replay. Was holding the other guy's face mask and moving him around with it.
Shea serrano, is that you?
They do, but I meant it more as like people such as Rory, Phil, Spieth, Fowler, Bubba. There were some great golfers there but because it falls between the PGA and the Open some other guys didn't show. 
Shhh. No facts just feelings.
Because there's been no run game. that's why he's also almost short of 50 touchdowns. he's basically brett favre. 
I dunno man. Luke McCown, given the chance, might really shine. 
2020 is a great SAT score, and 1670 as I understand it, is good in the new SAT format too (I graduated before the changes went into action). You have good extracurriculars, and your GPA is good too. You may not get full ride scholarships into your colleges, but you will definitely be getting scholarships and DEFINITELY getting into the colleges. you're doing better than probably 70% of high schoolers right now man. don't sweat it.
you have to pay more when you're not a favorable destination. you can pay less if you are favorable and have a chance of winning CL.
really felt like Bengals were toying with their opponent until the fourth quarter. Glad the Chiefs came back.
Equalizer
okay I'm on my boyfriend's reddit but when I was in high school I was crazy about my female best friend and never told her but found out literal years later that she had feelings for me too. Absolutely tell her how you feel. Trust me rejection is infinitely better than always wondering what could have been. 
Well, hopefully we get more episode AMAs. Then maybe some character discussions? 
I was gonna start Forte because he was rested last week and they really need him this week against a tough Seattle matchup. \n\nthe real struggle is deciding between the other three for me. Hill hurt me last week.
It's very disappointing to me. Wish there was more to do aside from exploring and radiant quests.
I thought the Lonesome Drifter or whatever talked about Montana?
the yellow card probably
the more you know. never saw them in Oklahoma/Texas.
Definitely get a fitting. A lot of people on here suggest cutting down the driver length when the 3w gets more distance, maybe that will help. 
they address those topics in their E:60s
clear tiers between Miami and OKC before the trade and that's coming from an OkC fan. golden state really didn't even become top tier until Kerr came either, which was after Miami fell off. 
So you'd rather have no domestic league at all? Insanity. 
Castillo is worth a good look too.
and for much of the last two years Kerr's plan was "use illegal screens to get good shooters open looks" right?
disagree about the broncos defense. broncos defense, in my opinion, are the best match-up in the entire nfl for that offense.
Love watching him play for FC Dallas. Best LW in MLS. Hope he makes his way to Europe one day.
great song. love the little thing at the beginning before he goes in. 
has that actually happened? 
I've seen it put on both sides of the political spectrum. 
To be fair, this is back when they thought they had to hide their true views. 
Thank you for posting in r/conservative , our country needs more reasonable people like you and respectful dialogue like this. 
The problem is that both sides of the aisle have people pushing for them to look the other way or support bringing in illegals.  Democrats gain guaranteed lifetime voters, Republicans cater to their business interests that want low-wage workers and to dilute the labor pool.  The people, naturally, are very against illegal immigration.  \n\nGenerally speaking, of course.  
That's what I thought. I've just heard talk of him offering a compromise, maybe not citizenship but a resident status? I mean, as long as he kicks out the ones that commit other crimes, I'd be alright with it. Takes ammo away from the Democrats.  
You heard talk?  That sounds like Fake News.  Trump has not indicated any position as of yet... he simply said he is sympathetic.
Good to have you here.  You're the kind of upstanding citizens we want and need
The Bottom line is our country needs to determine how many immigrants we are going to let in, and enforce that number. \n\nAre liberals for open borders? Because that's how you have a flood of people from India, Thailand, Eastern Europe etc looking for a better life. Then WE Become a third country. 
Rewarding illegals with citizenship had been done dems and repubs alike. \n\nThis is not a partisan issue. 
It was still a mistake and Reagan admitted as much himself
Who knows. It was on CBC last night, maybe it's true, maybe it isn't. 
I spoke with a gentleman about the jobs and how he gained his current position. This was in Bakersfield, CA and he, although marginally successful, lamented his current state. He was a land owner so I was perplexed by his regrets. Then he stated that his family owned large parcels of land near Monterrey, CA that they used to grow crops. They were very successful. \n\nThey were Mexican immigrants and held a soft spot to their former countrymen so they made it a priority to strictly hire illegal immigrants. They weren't like massive farms in that they didn't go cheap on the labor. They paid above minimum wage. They sought to give immigrants a strong standing point to make a good life in the US.\n\nThen in 1986 the amnesty program passed. That is when their business started to crash. He said they lost most of their workers overnight. Surely the jobs would be filled? Nope. The experienced a lasting labor shortage. It seems that no one wants to work a very laborious job and only get paid just over minimum wage. All his regular workers left the farm and went to work in restaurants. It hit them so hard that they sold the land and bought acres outside Bakersfield city limits. This is coming from a staunch amnesty supporter. 
It was because Congress did not hold up their end of the bargain.
Actually though, what do you think about Trump keeping the whole "kids born here with illegal parents are citizens"  thing? I've even heard talk of letting the parents stay, as a compromise to help build up support for deporting the ones who have committed other crimes while here. 
I identify as a starship. Stop coming at me with your racist bigotry and micro aggressions and stop assuming my gender. 
Or are (E) you at a naval museum?
Why they're called "anchor babies."
A. At sea\nB. In port\nC. I'm in a helicopter\nD. I refuse to answer that question...
Are you at sea or in port?
First part would take a constitutional amendment
Explain when Republicans did it.\n\nAnd before you bring up Reagan, it was done with the promise that border enforcement and illegal immigration would be tightened down.
Amazing how readily their stances change when it's politically expedient.  
A lot of Republicans are changing thier tune too now that Trumpism is the new way to win elections. 
Don't forget 2 decades of time as well.
Even as a liberal I find it difficult to understand why people are defending illegal immigration.\n\nMy mom became a US Citizen when I was a child and then spent a lot of time and money on immigration lawyers to apply for my green card so I could move across the ocean to come here. But I guess all of that is necessary only if your country doesn't share a border with the US?\n\nI have strong concerns on *what* policies will be effective at curtailing and discouraging illegal immigrations (no, I don't think the Wall will be effective), but I get extremely frustrated these days when people on the left label you a racist the second you bring up this very real issue.\n\nEnforce the laws we have, or change the laws if we don't like them, but don't have policies that *encourage* people to break those laws. It undermines the integrity of our system, and sends the wrong message to everyone.
In 1993, this was a perfectly mainstream, common-sense opinion, too. \n\nHow far we've come. 
Yep. I'm a liberal too, and I'm with you. I don't know how this became such a partisan issue.
What do you do with an anchor?
until we can't get enough American citizens to vote for our insane agenda.
Liberals have passed the point of sanity. 
Definitely helps with underarm sweat.  I don't shave mine, but trimming the hair shorter really helps.  I do that and use Right Guard spray antiperspirant, it works way better for me than stick antiperspirant or any of the other sprays I've used.  
Yup, same here.  If you were to look at my views on paper, you'd probably think I was a liberalv, but nope, they lost me a long time ago with the exact bullshit you mentioned.  I'm really glad to see the liberals in this thread angrily denouncing this abhorrent behavior, but I see way too much of this same hypocrisy and hatred every day on Reddit and other sources.  Just because you aren't throwing bricks or torching buildings doesn't mean you aren't part of the problem.  This constant outrage and hateful vitriol the last few weeks has done nothing but push people further to the fringes of the political spectrum.  I don't think the left understands just how badly they've overstepped and put the rights back up against the wall over the last couple decades (the last 8 years especially).  Trump is a manifestation of the anger and frustration of the right, and if this crazy shit the left keeps pulling doesn't stop, I'm afraid we're going to see some even more serious retribution when the people finally say enough is enough, we just want the madness to stop.
To every liberal coming to /r/conservative, please take a minute out of your day to read this.  There is no "Muslim ban" and what Trump is doing (while "hamfisted", as the author puts it) is not some wildly unprecedented act as the media and the rest of the hysterical left would have you believe.  This is pretty typical stuff when dealing with foreign refugees from known hostile territories, but as has become the mods operandi, people are twisting the truth to push and agenda.
It's called addiction, you judgemental jackass.  I can't believe the oh so tolerant Reddit is upvoting this shit.
It's amusing, but no, I don't see how it's a MR issue.  Some of the content here has been getting really questionable as of late.
These analogies are getting to be pretty comical.  Remember when Obama was a Muslim, white-hating communist that was going to take everyone's guns and put all the dissenters in reeducation camps?  Yeah, that's how stupid you sound.
Well, if I go rob a bank to get money so my family "can have a better life", I get put in jail and my kids get put into foster care if there's nobody else to take them.  This is no different, he broke the law and now he has to pay the price.  We wouldn't give a bank robber a penalty instead of jail just because they had children, they'd go to jail.  I realize this is an emotional issue (which is precisely what the media hopes to accomplish by constantly focusing on cases like this), but this sort of thing happens every day for other offenses.  
Ah yes, before the melancholy sets in and everyone becomes jaded and does nothing but bitch and fight with each other over every change and perceived slight by the developers.  It's like a microcosm of politics.  
Can we file this under "no shit"?  This sub bashes Donald constantly, and idk what the hell you're even bringing TRP into this for, I've never seen anything even remotely RP related here.  You want to bitch about something, how about the influx of liberals and socialists that have been peddling their statist bullshit around here since Bernie Breadlines lost?  How about all the faux libertarians who think they're libertarians, but don't know Milton Friedman from Mickey Mouse.  If anything, this sub is turning into another dumping ground for liberals to piss and moan about Trump, because they think we're all on the same side now.  How about this isn't /r/politics and it's not /r/notmypresident?  
Your idiot friend is why people that really need Xanax can't get a script for it.  
No, no, no, Michelle was gorgeous and "hot", because she was a liberal.  Nevermind she looked like a man in drag, it's only acceptable to bash and ridicule conservative women.  Now do you understand?
No, this whole conversation is silly.  We've devolved into an argument with people who want to "violently" overthrow the president, and now you're all arguing over who has more guns.  All because the left lost an election. This is fucking insanity.  Elections come and go, we don't start taking up arms against our fellow citizens because we don't like their politics.  I cannot believe how ridiculous this has gotten.
It's all about the narrative.  Personally, I think this "ban" is stupid, it's just emboldening the enemy and alienating our allies and the vast majority of Muslims that aren't radicals.  However, calling it "Muslim ban" is intellectually dishonest, it's no wonder liberals are all losing their minds when the media keeps twisting the truth to make Trump sound like Hitler.  You'd think after some of these crazed leftists started attacking Trump supporters, rioting, and kidnapping and torturing white people, they'd tone down the hateful, irresponsible rhetoric, but I know that asking the media (and unused that term loosely) to act like response adults is asking too much.  
The "few bad apples" argument is so worn out.  This isn't an isolated incident, this shit goes on all the time and it's absolutely not just a few antifa assholes starting trouble.  The "left" has an obligation to denounce these people and to curb the rhetoric that's driving their behavior.  As an individual, there may not be much you can do besides toning down your own rhetoric and stop feeding into the mass hysteria that's gripped the left, but as a whole (and I'm referring more specifically to the media and politicians), the constant excuses and support for this disgusting behavior has to stop.  Then we come to the larger issue of these supposed grass roots protests being funded and orchestrated by agent provocateurs like George Soros, who funnels millions into organizing and funding many of these protests turned riots.  The term "useful idiots" comes to mind here.\n\nSo yes, the left is absolutely responsible for the backlash that is coming if they keep sponsoring and abiding the violence and extraordinarily hateful rhetoric.  If you poke a dog with a stick enough times and it bites you, it's not the dogs fault, it's yours.  Same principal applies here, you back people into a corner and eventually they're going to push back.  It's going to reach a point where the regular people can't take it anymore and just want this shit to stop, and they're going to call on the government to do something about it.  In desperation is when people can make very bad decisions.
That's funny, the organizer of the women's March supports sharia law, and all those conservatives you feminists hate so much are vehemently opposed to it.  Seems to me the only ones pushing for Sharia law and defending oppressive Islamic states are liberals.  But do go on and tell me how it's the "neckbeards" keeping you down.
Make sure to ways buy the furniture protection plan.  I do this and trade my chair in every two years for what amounts to around $30.  It's not really fraudulent either, as the pleather always starts cracking by then anyways.  I haven't paid for a chair in probably eight years.
It is, it's just socially acceptable.  Caffeine is a highly addictive, powerful stimulant, it's just that it's use has been normalized in society.
Hell yeah, this is a good night right here.  
And it's no different than what Obama did, only much shorter!  The hypocrisy is fucking staggering!
That duck kept its fucking mouth shut like it's supposed to!
Nice copy/paste, and you're still wrong.  He isn't removing any "safety blocks", that's patently absurd hyperbole.  You people keep saying he's attacking human rights, what human rights??  Because he placed a *temporary* hold on refugees from terrorist nations?  Nations that Obamas administration identified.  A ban that's totally in line with previous presidents, including Obama.  Is it because he's ramping up border security?  Last I checked, illegally immigrating to another country isn't a human right, and pretty much every other country in the world agrees.  Or is it the imaginary attack in women's rights that seems to be founded solely in fantasy?  Is it because we aren't letting Syrian refugees flee here?  Because through 2016, we've taken in less than 2000 of them, and if you'll recall, Trump wasn't in office then.  \n\nYeah, his EO was poorly explained and poorly implemented, but there is no "Muslim ban", and the fact that it's even being portrayed in that way speaks volumes about how intellectually dishonest the people pushing this angle really are. \n\nThe only salient point you make is about free trade, but you've draped your entire argument under this nonsense premise that Trump is Hitler and he's going to bring back the Holocaust.  It's just more fearmongering and hysterical hyperbole, and at this point, you and your ilk sound like crazed conspiracy theorists.  
It's staggering how little self-awareness you have.
I swear they are programmed to talk to you at the worst possible time.  Wander the wasteland for an hour and not a peep, but soon as a pack of super mutants is bearing down on you, they turn into a fucking Chatty Cathy.  I'm enjoying the game, but holy shit does it have some annoying behavior, and companions are the worst.  
Aside from the free daycare, you just described the United States.  Are you really that delusional?
At least I haven't bought one yet.  I was going to look at an S6 once my warranty on my 2015 mustang runs out in September, but they won't get a dime from me now.  It's high time people on the other side of the PC insanity start voting with their wallets.  
This is an interesting and potentially plausible story but it doesn't explain some elements. Most specifically who was the second voice and what were the unexplained noises
See, now this is something people should be getting upset over.  This is something that deserves to be protested, not bullshit fake "Muslim bans" and imaginary assaults on womyns rights.  Of course, that would mean actually taking some responsibility for the last asshole in office who did this too.
Awesome, thanks for the link.  I sweat like crazy because I have an autoimmune disorder, and anything over about 40 degrees is just miserable for me trying to stay dry.  I've had decent success with Uniqlo airism and heat tech stuff, they're much better than regular cotton undershirts, but even they can't keep up on bad days.  Definitely going to give these Thompson's a try!
Yup, I hate when they accidentally explode and take my nuke with them.
I leaned a lesson many years ago, behind every joke is a little bit of truth.  
I dunno, could have something to do with the whole "death to America" thing.  Just a guess.
Uhhh, no.  I'm sorry if that's been your experience, but that's a ridiculously broad and innaccurate generalization.  
Actually, yes, it is on the republicans hands if Trump does serious damage. They elected him and they absolutely bare at least some of the responsibility for his actions.  Same goes for "the left" and their merry band of idiots tearing up the country because they didn't get their way.
God she's awful.  She is one of the worst actors I've ever seen outside of shitty B rated sci-fi/horror.  She was pretty decent when she was younger, I don't know what happened.  I'll never forget her atrocious performance in that Sandler movie, Mr. Deeds.  It wasn't a great movie to begin with, but she sure put some extra stink on it.  She damn near ruined stranger things for me, it's a good thing the show was so good it could drown her out.
The dumbass was using the official park service Twitter account to espouse his personal political beliefs.  If I used my companies Twitter account as a platform to voice my political opinions, I'd be fired.  This unprofessional jackass just had his Twitter priveledge revoked, that's not even a slap on the wrist.  I swear, you people are so petty and ignorant it's pathetic.
I don't know what game *you* were playing, but FC1 was an amazing game back in the day.  That was the original "but will it play..." game before crysis.  I'll concede that the last part where you start fighting the mutant...whatever the fuck they were supposed to be...things kinda sucked, but it was a *far cry* (pun totally intended) from a "broken mess".  
You are frighteningly ignorant.  
Two days?  This shit has been going on for months, it's reached a fevered pitch the last couple of weeks though.  They've turned all of reddit into one big whiny, hysterical circlejerk.  This place has really gone to hell.
I like it, but I'm really into olive green right now.
All they have to do is make up some bullshit story, let it gain traction, then pull it and act like it was an innocent mistake.  Damage is already done though.  All the liberal bloggers and fake news sites have already put it on blast, /r/politics has a big circle jerk, Facebook and Twitter are having a meltdown, but when the story is taken down for being a lie, they completely ignore it.  Rinse and repeat.  They know exactly what the hell they're doing, lying sacks of shit.\n\nI was honestly shocked when the story about the guy whose mother supposedly died because of the "Muslim ban" was proven to be yet another lie made the front page yesterday.
Idk man, bloodborne about wrecked me after being a PC gamer for so many years.  Maybe it had bad frame rate drops and that's what did it, but the whole thing felt like a lag fest to me.  I barely finished it because it gave me headaches so bad.  I'm sure huge frame rate inconsistencies make it worse, but even trying to game at a consistent 30fps on the rare PC game thats frame capped makes me nauseous as hell.  Not trying to be an elitist, but it really does make a huge difference.
NO
Because /r/politics is nothing but a big echo chamber, so they've had to take their tantrum to the rest of reddit since nobody is listening to them over there anymore.
Where do you shop for clothes at, Walmart?
Awesome, ty!  I've been using console commands to warp to my companion locations, it's just maddening trying to find them.  Idk what Bethesda was thinking here, companions are just a disaster in this game.  
You're talking apples and oranges here.  These fake "hate crimes" or acts of racism are a whole other level beyond some dumbass on gofundme looking for a handout.  This gets national attention and reinforces a disgusting narrative that America is a horrible, racist place.  Since Trump was elected, it become practically a daily occurrence for some liberal nutjob to fake a hate crime or other ridiculous, petty bullshit like this woman.  And yes, this is *absolutely* a "left thing".  You have to look at these things in context, it isn't just about getting a handout, it's about advancing a narrative.
Why?  You don't like all the tax money from people coming to your state to buy weed?
There was a lot of spite behind that block and foul by the coach. If I was a parent of that kid, or any of them really, I'd be worried. 
Wow... just... wow.  I'm not sure whether to post this to /r/iamverysmart or /r/cringepics. I don't think posting your thoughts on the internet is for you, man.  Try keeping your them to yourself for a while, I recommend forever.  
Sadly, it's about the only way anything gets done anymore.  The divide between the parties is so wide that nothing get accomplished without a supermajority or an EO.  I can promise you the democrats would have *never* allowed h1b reform to go through congress, especially with a republican in the WH.  Now I'm just waiting for the inevitable slandering by the media, calling this racist and unamerican.
I said the same thing when that idiot Marissa Meyer did the same thing at Yahoo.  Nevermind that telecommuting improves the workers quality of life, saves the company money on office space and utilities, helps the environment by taking care off the road, reduces traffic congestion and fatalities/accidents, etc.  No, no, let's take a giant leap backwards and flush all that down the toilet, because reasons...\n\nFucking idiots.
See, this is the whole problem with credibility.  This sounds like another case of bullshit and hyperbole (hell, let's just call it what it is p, **lying**) by the "media".  I can't believe anything I see about Trump because there is so much lying and disinformation to parse through.  If Trump *actually* does something, I want to know.  I absolutely want to know, but at this point, I cannot tell want is real and what is more left wing smear tactics.  Apparently, I'm not the only one!
Hypocritically criticizing other people's hypocrisy for criticizing your hypocrisy of their hypocrisy...aaaand I'm trapped in an infinite loop of idiocy.  The circle of stupidity is complete.  Well done, reddit, we've officially gone full retard.
Someone should tell these petty little dumbasses that leaving your sick patients is automatic grounds for losing your medical license.  It's called patient abandonment, and it's taken very seriously.  If you have any doubts as to just how stupid and self-centered these women are, here's proof smacking you in the face.
I have five different Timex watches, including the Waterbury and weekender chrono, and they're both dead quiet.  Only one I've ever had that was loud was the standard, non-chrono, weekender, which I returned.  
God this makes me feel old.  Aside from the Magnavox Odyssey and the RCA studio 2, I've played every one of these systems (and a few that aren't even on here).  Also reminds me how many systems have flopped over the years, and looking at their awful controllers, its not that surprising.
First time I saw this refresh I immediately thought Hyundai.  I don't even know what Hyundai, but that's the first thing that came to mind.  
Lol, you're dangerously naive if you think the left would have been fine with Kasich.  Sure, it wouldn't have been nearly as hysterical as it is now, but it would still would have been a huge temper tantrum.  Just look how Bush was treated for eight years, and he was nothing compared to Trump.  The left looks at Trump the same way the right looked at Obama, they were both the other sides worst nightmare.  I'm convinced there is no more "okay", only shades of outrage.
I'm not even mad, that's impressive.  \n\nThere is nothing, absolutely nothing, about this car that I like. Well done?
The gauge cluster (and possibly the motor upgrades, we don't know yet) is the only improvements I see. They ruined the front of that car, it looks ridiculous.  If this is the way Ford is moving with the mustang, I may be in the market for something else here real soon.  My 2015 has been a piece of shit so far.  I've only got 8700 miles on it and I've had to have the entire AC system replaced, both of my power side view mirrors have failed, I've had numerous weird things happen with the pcm (gauge cluster being totally unresponsive, car not starting, etc), my pony spotlight on the driver side just fell out the other day.  Passenger side seat latch broken the first week I had it.  Fucking ridiculous for a $45k car with this few miles.  I've got ten months left on the warranty, then this POS is gone, and I damn sure won't be getting one of these fugly 2018's.  Was planing on waiting for the 2020 refresh, but not with the way this is going.
13s are the only thing in stock right now, get them while you can!
And that's why I've waited until now to buy/play it.  I've got a ton of mods loaded that make it more bearable.  I'm thoroughly enjoying it, but it's pretty damn ridiculous that I still have to wait a year to play these games so the mod scene can fix them.
That's completely irrelevant, it in no way refutes the point.  Feelings don't mitigate facts.
Not only that, the media largely ignored or downplayed every damn bit of it.  Now all of a sudden, Trump ordering in a commando squad where people got killed is an atrocity.  Ya know, maybe, just fucking maybe, if they had grilled Obama on this shit the last eight years, it might have caused the government to rethink it's actions, but nope, they had to maintain the narrative.   Now it just rings hollow because they hold Republicans to a totally different standard, so liberals look like nothing but hypocrites with the anger and righteous indignation, and Republicans are just going to say "Obama did it and you didn't say anything" or simply ignore it because they've tuned out any media that might scrutinize these actions because they are so incredibly biased.  
I had the same initial impression, I thought "sooo tables?  We're back to tables?"  And that's true to some extent, but grid allows us to maintain proper separation of concerns and it's way more powerful and flexible than tables ever were.  I agree that it has taken way too long to get here though.  
Found him.
No, *liberals* trusted Obama more.  Don't try to make excuses for the hypocrisy, because that's absolutely all this is.  You're only upset now because it's a Republican in office, you all did the same exact thing shit to Bush when he was in office.  This has nothing to do with Trump and everything to do with partisanship.
Way to miss the point.  It's *congress* that is supposed to declare war, not the damn POTUS!  Yet, the POTUS is the one who has been overstepping his power for 80 years.  Now that Trump wants to retract that overreach of power, congress voted against it.  If they feel we should be at war with Russia, that's for them to decide, not the president!
If you're unemployed, maybe you could volunteer at the food bank if it would make you feel better about taking their food.  It's noble of you to want to save the resources for those you feel are less fortunate than yourself, but everyone needs a hand every now and then.  Might make you feel better about it if you could help them out as well.  Good luck to you, I've been where you are!
Does nobody remember the Tea Party??  That's exactly what we marched and protested about before the Sarah Palin express and the rest of her neocon cronies rolled in and ruined the movement.  That was the entire fucking message, stop spending our money, stop bailing out banks and corporations, stop expanding the size of government, enough fucking taxes already, etc etc etc!  That's exactly *where we were at*, and before some twit comes along and tells me it was because a black man got elected, that's bullshit, because my first rally was well before Obama even had a chance at the presidency.  Bush left office with a 23% approval rating ffs!  Only the most diehard right wingers still approved of him when he left office, while Obama left office at almost twice that number and near universal support amongst liberals and dems.  So I call bullshit on your worn out narrative that both parties are the same.  They all do stupid shit, but you're dead wrong on this one.
Yup.  Someone should play into their shitty little game, pretend to be a pedo, wait to be ambushed and then dole out a little vigilante justice on these self-righteous little shits.  Maybe then they'd understand why vigilantism is a bad idea.  I'd love to help catch some of these creep catchers, little bitches.  
I'm developing a site right now using CSS grid, and my god it's fantastic.  I don't typically get real excited about new features, but this is a real game changer for web design.  I work in WPF as well as web development, and it's beautiful having what essentially equates to WPF grid system in html.  Flex box is a nice step forward, but it still has its limitations and it's designed with 2D layouts in mind.  Grid is *actually* designed for laying out pages, there's no hacks, it's not fragile, there are no weird tricks needed to make things position correctly, it just works.  Oh, and it makes responsive design vastly more simple, so there's that too.  In case you can't tell, I love grid layout.\n\nThe site I'm working on is only for internal use by our technical team, so I don't have to worry about my userbase having old browsers, we all use the latest version of chrome.  Otherwise, I wouldn't even consider using it for a production site its so bleeding edge.  Going forward though, in the near future, this is seriously going to make our lives a lot easier.  
Sadly, this is the truth of the matter.  Bernie isn't a bad guy, but he's clueless as to how the world works.  Unfortunately, his followers, as is with most leftists, base everything on feelings and emotion.  I believe that's why their decisions, beliefs, and thought processes seem so foreign to the rest us, because we don't think with our emotions, we think with our heads.  All he has to do is parrot the same "rich people bad!  Socialism good!  1%! 1%!!!" drivel, and his base eats it up.  It's irrelevant whether or not his claims have any merit as long as they *feel* good.  
Yeah, it was so nice, the British turned it into a penal colony.  
Which is really stupid and short sighted.  Their die hard fans are what has kept the game alive, now they've alienated them too.  Console isn't going to save them, they've just succeeded in alienating the last of their players.  Honestly, the game is essentially dead and this was a last ditch effort to keep it going.  I just don't see it surviving, it's had way too many problems since day one.
/r/pics?  You mean all of reddit?  This is certainly dredging the bottom of the barrel though, the pettiness has gotten really pathetic.  Downvote away, children!
I just watched it a few days ago, it's an amazing movie.  I just wanted something laid back to watch on a sleepy Sunday afternoon...Fuck me, did I pick the wrong movie.  I highly recommend it to anyone that hasn't seen it yet, the tsunami scenes were gut wrenching, but the whole movie is an emotional rollercoaster (and I hate that term, I just don't know is else to express it).  Naomi Watts performance was really great, I believe she was nominated for an Emmy for this movie.  \n\nTLDR: see this movie, it's awesome!
He has a ton of infrastructure plans he wants to implement besides a wall, this would be a fantastic way to fund it.  Not only would it create millions of jobs in the legal mj trade, it will create millions of infrastructure jobs.  Seems like a win-win to me!
What assault on personal freedoms?  I'm not asking rhetorically, I genuinely want to know what freedoms are being attacked.  
It's a program that allows you to edit memory address values of a game while it's running, and essentially "hack" the game.  For instance, you track down which memory address points to the amount of life you have and change the value or lock it so your life never depletes.  Things like that.  
Which is interesting because most men that I know are attracted to a very diverse array of physical features, and I've seen personality win over guys who would otherwise not be attracted to a certain type of girl. I've also seen personality scare guys away from 10/10s. 
... or in 2008.  Remember when a few people, a "party" if you will, marched on Washington and they were called racists, terrorists, bigots, fascists, etc?  It had something to do with coffee, or maybe it was tea...something like that.  All I remember is that they were terrible people who hated their country and brown people (it had nothing to do with the bank bailouts, real estate collapse, corporate welfare, or the misdeeds of the current *and* previous administration.  *Nothing at all*), and that they were supposed to shut up and fall in line, and they didnt and that made them terrible people.  So, I'll be damned if I'm going to risk opposing the government now and being associated with those lunatics.\n\n
Agreed.  I had *almost* gotten over my initial disgust at the front end changes, but seeing these unstaged photos makes me dislike it even more than before.  Love the new gauge cluster and the dual tip exhaust, but that front end has no place on a mustang.  Maybe I'll like it more if I see it in person (I hated the s550 until the first time I saw one), but right now, I do not like.
It's fan-fucking-tastic.  The extra screen real estate is so nice in visual studio, I never have to horizontal scroll, or collapse any tool panels.  I can also anchor two windows to either side and have SQL/Photoshop/browser, etc open along side my IDE.  It's not quite as good as having multiple monitors, but I don't like multi-moniter setups for gaming (especially with only two monitors), so it's a nice compromise between the two so you can game *or* code on your screen.  I'd run three 21:9 2k monitors if I could, and get the best of both worlds, but they won't fit on my desk and a pair of Titans to run them won't fit my pocket book.
It's typical f2p nonsense.  Everything is meant to drive you towards spending more money, including the way it's developed.  Characters, costumes, consumables, etc are still way too expensive, so only the die hard fans buy them, which in turn, leads to a smaller player base and fewer people financially supporting the game.  That's why they keep pumping out new characters and costumes, so the few paying players will keep spending money, and they keep adding more and more and more stupid crap to eat up inventory space so people will be forced to buy stash space.  It's all about quantity over quality.  
That's easy to say if you aren't someone unfortunate enough to have a preexisting condition, but if you do, you're fucked.  You're essentially giving someone a death sentence if they have something like cancer and lose their insurance and can't afford care (ie. pretty much everyone).  If we're going to drop the preexisting condition clause, then we need to expand medicare to anyone that can't get private insurance or provide some means of getting coverage.  I was no fan of Obama or the ACA, but this was one thing he did right and the Republicans are going to have blood on their hands the first time someone's kid dies of cycstic fibrosis because their parents couldn't afford a lung transplant.  Yeah, it drives up costs for the rest of us, but I'm not okay with letting people die because they're too poor.  That's flat out inhumane.
That's being pretty generous, I don't believe there was any thinking done here at all.
You've...put a lot of thought into this, lol.  Seriously though, aren't there certain countries with no agreement with the U.S. with regards to alimony?  As in, they won't garnish your wages or assets based on US alimony rulings?  Maybe I was just dreaming...
Thank you!  That's what I've been trying to get across from the outset of all this insanity.  Have these people never heard of the boy who cried wolf?  At this point, I already have a hard time taking any criticism of Trump seriously, because the left has grossly mischaracterized and completely lost their shit over every single thing he's done, real or imaginary.
I don't believe this is free content.  They say it's part of the *expansion*, which you have to pay for.  Unless I'm missing something here...
Worst. Honeymoon. Ever.  
Agreed.  I got a pair last time around (a few weeks ago) and they're cheap as hell.  The uppers look like plastic, not like any "full grain leather" I've ever seen.  In fact, I'm pretty sure they say "genuine leather" (aka, garbage) on them if I remember right.  I didn't even bother putting them on, I just returned them.  They're $40 boots and they look like $40 boots.  You get what you pay for.  Mine were "made in India", fwiw, which apparently indicates the newer, cheaper manufactured line. 
Gotta agree here.  The EPA absolutely needs to be reigned in, they've gone way off the rails and assumed way to much power, but we absolutely need them.  Hell, even many staunch libertarians agree that EPA is an example of good government.  Problem is, Obama started using them as his own enforcers to get around congress and let them grow out of control.  That pissed off a lot of people, and now we are seeing a knee-jerk reaction in the other direction, which isn't the right way to handle this either.  
It's ridiculous in that it's not true, yet it still gets repeated as if its dogma.  The government changed the standards for what is considered overweight back in the last 90's and suddenly we had an obesity epidemic overnight.  They use BMI, which is a totally innaccurate measure of obesity.  Did you know that under these new rules, very fit, muscular people are considered obese?  Tom Cruise and Michael Jordan were two notable celebrities I remember that were considered overweight by the new standards set.  I am considered obese, even though I'm not even close to being overweight, I just have a lot of muscle mass because I was a bodybuilder for many years.  It's really awesome, because I get treated as an obese person when trying to get life insurance.  Yeah, there are a lot of overweight people in the US, but the numbers are horribly inflated and misleading.  Not the sub in which I expected to have this conversation.
Over priced ar15
We say gully washer. Our cat saying is a little different. We say "nervous as a cat on a hot tin roof". 
You could literally say this (or a version of this) of just about any politician or leader.  You aren't clever or original, this is a slogan on a bumper sticker.  \n\n\nOf course, it's about Trump, so reddit has to have a ravenous circlejerk.  I didn't vote for the guy, I don't think he's a particularly good leader, but the hate and vitriol towards him is beyond ridiculous.  It's staggering how fucking petty this sub has become. It's not enough that pretty much all of reddit has become one big fucking liberal temper tantrum, but the mods here have turned this into their own personal soapbox to cherry pick stupid quotes and hysterical rants/tropes to push an agenda.  I'm out, thanks for ruining yet another good sub, you fucking children.
Doesn't matter, the narrative has already been set, the lie has been told, and the damage is already done.  People will always question if Trump is/was in collusion with Russia, his credibility is damaged no matter what they report now.   They aren't stupid, they know exactly how this works.
Go crazy?
Gosh, is that time of the month again?  Time for mileneal whine week again already, where does the time go?
I'll second that. Haven't worked in Java in several years since I moved to .net, and I have no desire to ever go back.
Every day I think the Trump hysterics can't get any more ridiculous or pathetic, and every day improved wrong.  Seriously if you believe this crap, you need to have your head examined.  This is getting just embarrassingly stupid.
When millions of stupid assholes are doing the backstroke in that shallow pool, it's hard not to take issue with it.
I'd rather not see something I love used as a tool of police intimidation.  Unmarked police cars, *especially* something like a yellow Mustang, for traffic enforcement are bullshit.  Police vehicles should be clearly marked so civilians can identify if they're dealing with a real police officer and not some random person with lights on their car.  This is nothing but another means to wring more money out of people's wallets, and many unmarked cars are taken through civil asset forfeiture, which is a massive travesty of justice.\n\nSorry for the rant, but this kind of shit just infuriates me.
But Canadian tire. What's up with that shit!? I go to Canadian tire near Calgary and people say to me "oh yeah it's like the best store in Canada and they even sell guns, like cheap SVT40s and SKS and M1A."  So I'm like sweet, I gotta check this place out. So I go to the first Canadian tire. Like people aren't kidding that you can buy literally anything at Canadian tire, *but* location is everything. But anyway, it's like Lowes and REI and Walmart all rolled into one weird love child. But no guns in the first one, like what the fuck Canada I thought this was your store for all your maple syrup finding moose riding adventures into the frozen wilderness and I'm pretty sure at some point the quintessential Canadian adventure involves slapping down a bear with the butt stick of an old ruskie gun. \n\nSo on to the second Canadian tire. And yasss this place has guns. Walk up, see SKS. NevaBeenSeenBeFo.jpg. Ask to see that thing, it's a real deal Russian. Geronimo the Indian behind the gun counter says "let me see your gun ID card". I should also note this is the first time I've ever seen a real live Native American, unfortunately ours decided to disappear for some reason (but I thinks the gubbament iz behind it). Anyway I tell him I'm American and I swear to god he looks at me with more than a hint of jealousy. \n\n"Oh so you can buy these all day down there". Yep. Anyway he gives me the gun, and starts telling me how it's a WWII German rifle. No, but nice try friend. No SVT40s in sight, so I'm feeling kind of ripped off right now, they jipped me into their store. No other semi autos at all actually, all fudd rifles. Somehow I know in my heart of hearts that even though we may pronounce "about", "moose", "goose", and many other words differently, North Carolinians and Albertans aren't all that different. Fudds, the lot of them. \n\nTo add insult to injury, as I leave the store they make me put my credit card in this thing called a "chip reader"... were still about 2 years removed from this alien technology in the backwoods of North Carolina, and apparently our perferred currency of sex with our sister-mommas isn't valid here either. And as I walk out the door, as a final fuck you they give me this Monopoly money that I can only redeem for like 1 cents a buck at Canada Tire, and when I withdraw cash they give me this Monopoly money that's only good in Canada!\n\nAll in all, I rate Canada Tire 3/10. If you like guns, don't let people fool you in to going there. You'll go in thinking you're going to buy a cheap SVT, ammo, bedrolls and a propane stove and leave with a garden gnome, leather gloves, lube and a cattle prod. And since the Canadians are very forward thinking people, it doesn't even phase the cashier that you're buying this sadistic combination of items. 
Murdering white farmers, raping little girls, pillaging villages, throwing cinderblocks into people's heads (I just mention that because there's a horrific video of an African tribe killing a fellow African out there by throwing rocks and cinderblocks on his head, and lighting him on fire among other things), and child soldiers are all cool right? Not much worthwhile in Africa. 
You might be disappointed Lokiriver. My experiences with FALs have been lack luster to say the least. They're fundamentally good guns, but the metric v inch thing creates problems when some people (century) try and combine the two. They're also easy to fuck up if you're building apparently. Even DSAs have issues. 
I love box.

I'm not going to waste my time responding to every single link you've put down, but having browsed through most of them, there is very little substance. The crusades were started by Muslims; there is no such thing as Christian ISIS (seriously?); one of the links is literally a link to "European Wars", in which there were far more humanistic and political factors at play than there were religious; Christianity may have been twisted to support slavery but it was largely ended world wide because of Christians; the KKK is rooted in hatred of blacks, not glorification of God; the Spanish Inquisition was unfortunately a real thing, as was the burning of people as heretics though this period largely coincides with a political era in the same periods as several of the Popes undoubtedly on your list of worst popes, people who were never members of the rank and file Clergy but who bought their way into bishop and pope positions; your "Christian Terrorism" link literally talks about 3 historical groups, one of whom is the KKK. Essentially, you aren't revealing anything new, and most of the things you have posted have limited merit/ application anyway. \n\nAnd let's not forget the well over 100 million people that Atheists killed in the 20th century alone. 
Bikes today are so expensive too. I would love to buy a new bike but I can't afford it, and I don't see how many young people can. 7-10K is a lot of money for something you're going to thrash. Not to mention maintenance costs, which are even higher because of the short service intervals on dirt bikes. And then replacement parts for inevitable broken levers and plastics. And gas. Transport. Gate fees. Food. I love riding, but I can't do it more than a few times a year.
It wasn't, and that's a weak and racist excuse. You won't even give people the dignity of responsibility for their own actions. Either they're equal people capable of thinking for themselves and making their own decisions or the white man has to think and do everything for them.  It cannot be both. 
Not Catholic. Very early Protestant.

A portable sundial was mentioned in Shakespeare's As You Like It.
The Religion of Peace everyone. I don't agree with the LGBT shit, but the worst you're going to get from me is avoiding you and not going out of my way to engage with you. Also, dirty looks, because most Tranny's look surreal and freaky. Like a human trainwreck. Also, predicting it now, liberals will say I am scum of the earth, but say nothing about these killings.
Same. I like Ted. I didn't like him this go around, but if he can become a little more humble, a little more personable, I'll vote for him. I line up with him on 98% of the issues. I said it when he lost about why I didn't vote for him this time around: Ted needs to grow as a person. He's young, he has time on his side, and he has the ability to grow into something awesome. After these 8 Trump years, he should be even better than he is now, and ready to go bat clean up.
Sounds like he got chased into a field/ through woods with another guy. They've both been running, that's why they're breathing heavily. Other guy has been shot, but perhaps not badly hurt. When they ask if he needs an ambulance the other guy says yes, as Brandon starts to answer no. They might but it sounds like getting a policeman was more pressing of a worry. It sounds to me like he's in a field beside the road, possibly near a tree line. He went through the woods from the road and called from the middle of a field. 
Seriously, what is your occupation? And how do you find these deals 
Sounds like typical Islamic activities. 
So buy another. ARs aren't scarce. They can be had super cheap. 
Bingo. Agree 100%
Surely this is a joke. You do realize Islam conquered all of the Middle East, North Africa, the levant, Southern Europe, and Spain, all at the tip of the sword? Not to mention historical conflicts between different sects that have cost millions upon millions of lives (see Iran-Iraq war for just one example). 
Sounds like they're buying you a brand spanking new M1A at discount. 
So both?
He was definitely with another individual. They definitely said something about going through the woods. I think the other individual was the one hurt because you can hear his somewhat weaker affirmative to needing an ambulance just as our main speaker is drawing breath to speak. I think they actually overlap if you listen close. Someone chased him and another person off the side of the road into the weeds. His last known cell ping was 3 miles from the areas being searched for him.  When he called, he was in a field. It's creepy. I don't think the police were involved as others speculate. I didn't hear anything indicative of state troopers, I think he had walked up on another car down the highway that potentially both the killer and the other person/ people emerged from. I think the other person was planning on killing the person who ended up running with Lawson, but Lawson stumbled upon the scene, distracting the killer. 
The whole call would be nice to have. I haven't listened to it since this morning but I think I heard it split maybe right after the whole question about the ambulance. 
I like how people who never got more than a participation trophy are commenting on how this is totally appropriate and kids need to harden the fuck up. \n\nYou can check my history, I am completely against the whole participation trophy mindset. But unlike you retards who think that if you see an issue with this, you're a pussy; I played DI sports in college. I had my share of trash coaches, and any coach who behaves like this towards 6-7 year old kids has real problems. There is a lot of malice behind this dude's actions. \n\nThis guy is the coach that makes kids quit sports and go home and sit their asses on the couch and get fat. This guy is the coach who turns kids off from doing productive things after school instead of robbing the food joint down the way, or doing drugs. This isn't the coach that's making NBA caliber player. Coaches like this can have long lasting negative impacts. \n\nThis isn't an appropriate way to teach kids the lesson you all think he's teaching. Want to teach kids consequences? Let him score on himself. And let him deal with being poked fun of by his teammates or parents. Mediate that behavior of course, but a little light teasing and he'll learn not to go that way naturally. Or he won't. It doesn't matter at the end of the day because it's little kids basketball and there are much more important lessons to be learned.

Shooting. I am not as involved as I'd like to be because of monetary constraints, but one day I would love to shoot matches, preferably like Service Rifle matches. I'd also enjoy doing competitive sporting clays.\n\nHow did I get into it? My parents bought me a break action air rifle in 6th or 7th grade. I loved shooting my air rifle, it was always a blast and I couldn't get enough. In high school we moved out into the country and I suddenly had a lot of room to shoot my air rifle. I got pretty proficient with it, I could split a pencil in two from about 10 yards away if I stuck it in the lawn.\n\nThen my grandfather gave me a .22 against the wishes of my dad. I only got to shoot it one time before I "really" got into guns. About a year and a half after shooting the .22 for the first time, I started working for my dad and he paid me a bit. I was going to take the money and lift my jeep, but I didn't have enough, so I went and bought a Mauser rifle, something I'd been dreaming of doing for years. Took that to the gun range and convinced my dad to come, and the rest is history.
I looked at the location on google maps where the car was found and there are woods/ tall shrubs 200-300 yards distant. Also go back and listen to the recording. I think it is edited ~2/3 to 3/4 of the way in.

What was in the picture? Pepe?\n\nSurely you aren't talking about the Rhodesian post? Because it goes both ways. Africans are murdering and evicting white farmers from their land as we speak. Africa is a fucked up place.
It was the explicit goal of these regimes to eliminate religion. I'm not really sure how you can construe it any other way. 
I'm from North Carolina. We have a lot of idioms. Two of my favorites are "as useful as tits on a bull", and describing something as "like pulling hen's teeth". Another one is saying something is easy as herding cats. Or as nervous as a cat on a hot tin roof.

You aren't going to find much beyond that website. Mosins were covered in stamps, and the meanings for most of them are lost to history. It's always fun to wonder though. My mosin for instance has a large boxed in B marking on the right side of the receiver (not the black powder proof). I've only seen it on one other weapon, a Kremlin guard rifle. I posted it here and I couldn't find it, I checked that website you mentioned and scoured for hours and happened to see it on the receiver of one of those rifles under a special markings section. There were no notes for that marking, it isn't even on the list. And my Mosin is one of the cleanest examples I've seen, and extremely accurate. 
Not really, since having clear guidelines doesn't let us off the hook. Like I said, we can clearly point to biblical rules and say "clearly these people weren't Christian nor are they representative of Christianity, they merely try and claim our ideology". But since you have no guidelines to being atheist, any action taken by atheists is representative of atheism. If that weren't the case, you couldn't claim people like Stephen Hawking or Richard Dawkins because they would merely be their own individual. Atheism is an ideology, make no mistake. But it is undefined and open, united by loathing of religion as this sub indicates clearly. 
Yeah. I don't have the money unfortunately to buy anything much more than I have already. \n\nEdit: someone really doesn't like you because they keep down voting you
Delete lawyer. Hit Facebook. Gym up. \n\nIn all seriousness, been there and done that. It gets better. Go out with friends and find prosocial ways to use your free time. Don't sit and mope. Go meet girls, they're out there and want to meet you. 
I have two ranges that I go to. One is a rifle and pistol range. It is free and open to the public. When I go there, I shoot rifle. I usually bring my K31, which is a "straight pull" military rifle fielded by the Swiss from about the mid 30s to early 50s. I also shoot my Mosin Nagant 91/30 a lot, it is a Russian bolt action rifle that was fielded by the USSR in WWII. An earlier derivative, called the M91 was used in WWI. I don't usually bring my Mausers because my range is 100 meters and they are sighted at 200 meters on the lowest battle setting. I also shoot my .22, but it aggravates me because the rear peep sight is too large. So my favorite rifle is probably my K31.\n\nI have another range nearby which is a clays range, you shoot little orange clay disks with shotgun. It is a lot of fun. I just shoot my grandfather's old double barrel shotgun, thats all I have.\n\nI can't really pick a favorite between rifle and clays. Rifle is more meticulous, but small groups are rewarding and the recoil is fun to me. Shotgun is fast paced and exciting, and feedback from hits is instant. It is fun to compete against friends if you are shooting clays, it literally is like golf with guns.\n\nBut yeah, I highly encourage everyone to try shooting at least once. If you hate it, then at least you got to get out of the house and do something different. If you love it, your wallet might not like you, but you will find that it can be extremely therapeutic. If you ever want to go, you can go to a range and rent a gun. I would suggest doing that and also paying for time with an instructor to introduce you to the basics, you want to make sure you know how to operate everything safely above all else. Precision comes with practice.\n\nI hope that answered your question lol.

Hung targets on a tree at friends property. Backed up 125-150 yards and shot them. Got to see the impressive results of 7.5 Swiss versus a 8-9 inch thick tree. Through and through penetration with more than enough velocity to kill even after passing through the tree. And the trajectory through the tree was pretty straight too. It was unintentional but impressive. \n\n\nAlso, we need to get rid of all the AR shit posts. So many, every single fucking day on this sub.

I didn't look at the ad because honestly I'm really tired, but I usually run under the assumption that if something seems amiss, it usually is. Playing it conservatively won't net you any "scores" when it comes to guns, but it usually won't bury you either. When the rational part of people's minds overrides red flags, that is usually when you get bitten, or at least that has historically been the case for me. 
https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Christians_in_the_Soviet_Union\n\nAnd that's just the start. And then once you're done reading all that history and the related articles, go read about China. Go read about Romania. Educate yourself. \n\nAnd the thing about atheism is that there is no doctrine, you can't say "well these people aren't real atheists". You can't dissociate these people from atheists because atheists aren't a group. Therefore they are representative of atheism by default. We can point to Christians who do horrible things and very clearly show dissociation because we have moral guidelines that define proper behavior.

Cool. Just wondering. That's my great great (I think?) grandfather. I've been curious if anyone on here has ever heard of him or his guns/ shop. I'd love to find one of his guns to keep in the family. The shop still operates today though but I'm not sure where their product goes 
I mean killing people with recoilless rifles and anti-aircraft guns, crucifixion, rape, throwing gays off buildings, stoning women, not allowing people to get a secular education, sodomizing young boys (remind me how that's not gay, ISIS), pouring acid on women, holding absolute control over women as property, and much more is all pretty fucking horrible. If they got rid of all that wicked shit, then they wouldn't be Isis. They'd just be the state of Iraq and the Levant. Then they might be half way okay. 
He ground looped
The best one was when he said "They said that I should keep doing the way I'm doing it but please keep the number of times you say "cunt" under six". Then he continues to use the word cunt more than six times including calling another sponsor a cunt then saying "Damn, I guess I do say "cunt" a lot".\n\nOf course, the best one was when he had Nature Box. He starts to read the ad then stops reading it mid way through and says "What the fuck, don't buy this shit. Go eat a fucking banana". He lost them right after that.

I think on that stretch of highway he stumbled on something he wasn't supposed to see when he came upon another car on the side of the road. I theorize that this other car had the person seeking to harm him inside of it, and at least one other person. I strongly suspect this other person was the initial target of whatever was happening and Lawson happened to stumble onto whatever was going on. This distracted the perpetrator, giving time for the other person and himself to bolt. As they escaped, other person took a hit from the perp shooting at the two escapees. If you look in the google earth view, there are light woods/ tall scrubs about 200-300 yards from the road. I hypothesize that the pair reached the woods and rememerged into the field on the other side. \n\nAbout midway through this field, they call the sheriff. Lawson tries to relay the story between gasping breaths. When they asked for police, the other, wounded person answered in the affirmative to needing an ambulance. If you listen closely you can hear the beginning of Lawson's answer and this other answer overlap. \n\nApparently in the call to the brother he relayed similar information, that he was hiding in a field and someone was bleeding. Therefore, the stories would match up. (I'm taking the information from his official missing website btw). I think the other person answering in the affirmative demonstrates definitively that this was not a psychotic break or drug episode as maintained. Additionally his phone was last pinged 3 miles from the search area. I believe that one of the party made it this far from whatever the danger was. I doubt that the wounded person made it that far. \n\nMy theory is that the people perpetrating the crime were either serial killers or perhaps human smugglers/ traffickers. The other person involved sounded American, I would guess that this person was a long time runaway, or transient who would not be searched for. Likely from another area of Texas or even another state. That would be why no additional searches would be launched for a second missing person, because they were already reported missing elsewhere or people assumed they had simply left town. \n\nEdit: it also sounded to me that the tape might have been edited. \n\nTo put it succinctly, I think it was serial murder or a cartel killing gone wrong, and our guy happened to stumble onto the scene as he walked down the highway or when he ran out of gas. 
The accent isn't the difficult part, I can understand by and large everything he's saying (but I'm a southern boy). The fact that he's out of breath and cramming everything into a very short amount of time on the phone makes it impossible to understand. He's scared and mashing words together, that isn't typical of southern speech, at least not the words he has running over each other.  
Almost certainly a scam, man. If it seems too good to be true, it is. Just like Craigslist. I've never bought anything off Craigslist that wasn't a steaming turd. Friend buys off gunbroker regularly, his luck hasn't been much better. So be careful what you buy/ bid on.

It's great that your dad supports you, but there is no reason you can't be a livestreamer with a degree as well, just in case. It's a high competition market. Easy money if you happen to hit it off right, but that's a big if. And the competition is enormous, and the market unpredictable.\n\nThat said, best of luck to you!

Yeah! Education! Ha! The thing the Catholic Church provided for hundreds of years! Maybe people would actually learn some science! Like the sciences that the Catholic Church funded and supported for hundreds of years, and were almost the sole supporter of because no one else in dark ages Europe gave a shit! Ha! Maybe people would understand things like the Big Bang! Discovered by a Catholic preacher! Stupid Christians! Or maybe we could learn about maths, just like the mathematical theorists sponsored largely by the church during the renaissance! Stupid fucking Christians. And maybe they'll learn about the arts, like some of the greatest artistic works in human history that were entirely funded by the church! And architecture too! My god, maybe then Christians will be enlightened, dumbfucks. \n\n\nYou people are literally a meme. The church has long been a proponent of education and has often times been the only thing maintaining our scientific knowledge. The church is responsible for preserving a lot of ancient works and theories, and the establishment of most of the prestigious world universities.

This is about a push to have Tampons be tax exempt as a medical necessity instead of a luxury good. The push is to essentially remove sales tax on tampons. \n\nWhen I buy razors I certainly pay sales tax so I am not sure what they mean here.\n\nMen need razors for professional jobs but don't need them really. It's more a social thing. While women need hygiene products to be hygienic. \n\nThis is really not something that needs special tax exemption because so many things fall under necessity vs luxury. I need to brush my teeth, right? But I pay tax for it. I need toilet paper but I still need to pay tax for it.\n\nRight down to the core this is about special treatment and nothing more. I'm sure it sucks to have to buy these products to function from day to day but there are so many other things that fit that description. Pads, tampons, and cups are no different.\n\nedit: I'm not sure about this but are razors allowed as an item deduction and tampons aren't then I can stand by changing that. Although, I have never included razors in itemization.
Edging? Ha! Can't believe you said that. I have a chronic condition. I'm susceptible to it, have been since I was a teenager, for whatever reason. So many funny situations where doctors had to check my balls. Best one was when they brought in med students to review an ultra sound when I was 16. Left the damn door open, even. Saw the nurses across the way giggling. I chose to take that as a compliment. Being a curious teenager, I got them to let me use the ultrasound on my own balls. It was fun.
I can hear that horrible scraping sound in my head. Probably worse than nails on a chalk board.

My mother has chronic pain. Like can't walk or function chronic pain. 10 years ago if she ran out of meds and had to go to the emergency room they would very quickly give her meds. Now, because the DEA shutdown of opioid prescriptions, she has to be bleeding on the floor for the doctors to give her meds. I'm all for responsible opioid control but now they are so under fire from the opioid epidemic that even when someone has a legit history requiring them the doctors still make it difficult. The pendulum swung hard the other direction in some respects.
The danger is, and I have experienced this myself, is sometimes semen comes out even if you haven't actually reached climax. This usually happens when the climax is teased a lot or you edge just a little too close. Sometimes there is a bit that wells up just before the pop and if you wait too long before pulling out the little bit might be enough. No babies for me thankfully. I don't do that stuff anymore because I need a lot more assurance. \n\nAt the same time when I was playing sexual Russian roulette my girlfriend and I were practicing the rhythm method. I'm not religious it just made sense to monitor the ovulation cycle closely. Some might know but there are a number of days where it is nearly impossible to for a woman to get pregnant. Once again, this is still risky but if you are doing that and pulling out, the chance of pregnancy is even lower.
What's really disturbing, is how common that is. I, personally, know of at least 3 marriages that started with either the groom or bride fucking someone in a last ditch hooray.

You have an agenda and that makes you suck. You make it sound like putting lead in pipes is some kind of sexual fantasy for a corporation. Lead was choice material for pipes and such 100 years ago because it is easy to form because it is soft. Steel and PVC are much better choices nowadays both for cheapness and not having lead in them.
I had all my teeth drilled out and filled with color similar in Mexico for $120 flat 10 years ago. I visit a dentist for the first time in 10 years 6 months ago in the US and I still don't have a cavity but in serious need of a cleaning. I'm sure if they could they would have done serious work given I have exceptional insurance now. Lesson is if you have the wherewithal go to Mexico.
My single biggest reason I despise the death penalty, with your reason being a close second, is because people are emotional revenge seekers by nature. Catharsis should not be the driving force for prosecution. Yet, the need to seek justice in lieu of truth to make the public *feel* safe or for the system to validate itself trumps anything else. When a child is brutally murdered the public and justice system goes into to full pitchfork mode, frothing at the mouth spouting the need to crucify anyone for the horrible crime. No conclusive evidence? No, problem they can find someone to say what needs to be said. And the suspect is a piece of shit anyway who should rot in jail. What's important is that "justice" is done. It becomes mob mentality.

>But I just can't shake this automatic dislike for anyone or anything trying to sell me something.\n\nThis all comes down to insecurity. We are all vulnerable to it. But you can't deny that you dislike it simply because you are afraid you will get bamboozled. It really is amazing to think that someone can charm you to the point where you will do something that, later, you don't want to do or buy. You are scared that you will agree to something that you don't really want but because someone with seemingly magic powers can convince you otherwise. We are nothing but animals; susceptible to dangers we know exist and can do nothing about.

>I encourage you to read stories about women who do work (and may already have kids they're caring for), who want to get an abortion, but can't because of the states strict laws. \n\nI know woman who have been in this situation. I am all for access but I am also for making personal choices. This is a cold reality. Getting pregnant changes your life and invariably presents difficult obstacles. But this is a personal choice and personal freedom of choice is not a disadvantage.\n\nIf their situation is so dire that they can't take time off of work then why have children? If they don't use contraceptives for religious reasons then they probably can't have abortions either. I know mistakes happen and I would like there to be an option for women to get the help they need. But I fail to see how this is a disadvantage that doesn't stem from personal choices.\n\nPaternal leave is not a right given by the government which is a tragedy. But I'm saying that at the time of labor. The woman cannot go to work during this time. The time off is going to happen whether it's for an abortion or for labor. This is not a disadvantage. It is the result of personal choice. \n\nedit: I'm all for protesting to keep the option for abortion and to make it easier for women to have the option

These are ok but they create waste. Now, my ultimate goal is to not let food go to waste but if I have to wrap my celery in foil then I'm not eating it fast enough. \n\nThe herbs in a bath are good because I usually buy herbs fresh for one recipe without another purpose in mind.\n\nIf you put your asparagus in a mason jar and put plastic over it then you should just not buy asparagus until you have a reason to buy it. \n\nThe plastic over the banana is just unnecessary. If you are not eating bananas fast enough before they get too brown, then don't buy as many bananas or freeze them for banana bread. \n\nThe strawberries. Just don't do this. Buy strawberries and eat them that day or within two days. Don't add ingredients unless you are preparing something in particular. Otherwise freeze for smoothies. Most importantly, don't buy more strawberries than you can eat before they go bad. Don't add waste.\n\nThe only part of this that I can appreciate is the spring mix greens. It's hard to keep that fresh and any trick to make it last more than a few days is golden.

He reminds me of my Grandfather, the way he speaks. In cadence and accent. When I would ask my grandfather why he talks like that he'd say "I speak like the great men around me spoke" and I'd respond "No, I mean you sound like you're a old Jewish man". He would laugh and say "Like I said before". My grandfather was not Jewish but growing up in New Jersey he was surrounded by many Jewish people and he had a great respect for their tradition of story telling. I saw that in him and never really heard of this aspect of Jewish tradition. \n\nIn fact, I know that my grandfather was involved with the mob back in the day but because of his actual ethnic background he couldn't associate or do business with the Italian mafia. What did he do? He let them believe he was Jewish. Whats funny, years later, while watching the Sopranos I noticed a character that was almost the spitting image of my grandfather. Not just looks either, the character even talked and carried himself like my grandfather. I'm talking about Hesh.\n\nI miss that man. He had a way with words and a hell of a storyteller.

Some might say the ability to bare children as an advantage (not an anti-abortion statement). You also can't protest away biology. Women bare children and it cannot be construed as a disadvantage because things can go south.\n\nedit:\n>poor women are forced to give birth if they cannot afford to take time off of work to drive hours away to clinics\n\nEventually, they will have to take time off of work. Like when they give birth and have to care for the child. I don't understand this point.
You're reaching there, buddy.

I second this. After I did my 2015 taxes I discovered my hourly income was about $7.50/hour for drive time and that's during choice social hours. Not worth it for me.

I remember reading that the Bear's mad dash up the hill was probably the result of impending doom that washes over it from the heart problem. It was noted that the bear acted very strange prior to the tumble as if it was running for it's life. In humans this happens. You get an uneasy feeling and start to have cold sweats. Then you get a very strong sense that you are going to die very soon, so you panic. Your anxiety goes through the roof and then you collapse.
> Beyond the movie, the obvious racism point comes from the fact that people have mistaken Sinbad, a famously huge comedian in the 90s, with another black man, Shaq, a famous basketball star who also had quite a few TV and movie cameos and roles back then.\n\nI believe that is called the Blacksimile Effect.

I think Dr. Seuss mastered the self-satisfied grin.
I totally believe it. I meant more like he wandered into the lion's den and knew he'd come out looking pretty good.
As you grow older the more you view your parents as just regular flawed people. Knowing my Dad is plowing my stepmom is a point of pride but not something I'd want to witness. I'm sure when I first heard the characteristic noise I did a fist pump. 
Outside Beachwood.
One thing that bothered me out this story, initially, was that he said they were barred from travel on the day of the order and the mother died the next day. If that woman was so deathly ill it might not be a good plan for international travel. Let alone make it to an American hospital on time.
Based on this and the Rapid ramen video I'm beginning to think that the Japanese don't know the difference between a minute and a minuet.
Personally, I have seen my step mother put up with some shit. They have been together for longer than my parents have and I commend her for putting up with my Dad's shit. He's not a violent man but he is a dead bedroom type of guy (Hate that I know that). About 15 years into their marriage my step mom flipped out and turned that bastard around. I had moved back in around that time and while I was trying to sleep in the guest bedroom I heard things I never heard when I was a kid. I was both creeped out and proud at the same time. Never thought I would be rooting my Dad for plowing my step mom but that's why life is so grand; it's full of wonderful surprises.
Thanks for providing some knowledgeable insight. I'm was merely reiterating what was said a while back when this was posted in videos or something. 
This happened to me recently. I was just calling the robot voice that she was a dumb cunt, for no good reason. "Would you like to use the same account number you did last time?" "Fuck yeah, you dumb cunt". Automatically transferred to a representative asking, in a very concerned voice, "Is everything Ok?".
Biggest barrier for period sex, in my experience, has always been the woman. There are a lot of women who think it's gross and will refuse sex.

I know a woman who is a strong advocate for her son with autism. Her motives seem to stem entirely in shame avoidance and not about coping with her's son more difficult circumstances. \n\nI have a sister who is mentally disabled from a genetic disorder and this woman wanted to bond due to our sort of similar circumstances. \n\nThe thing is, I grew up with my sister and have grown to accept her for who she is and have grace in the life circumstances that come from having to care for someone who looks like an adult but acts like a child. This means that some of the things I say to/about her may come off as insensitive but the reality is, she is my smelly sister like my other normal sister. I treat her like I would a younger brother would treat an older sister (e.g. I tease her and make her laugh with my dirty jokes) but at the same time I'm her older brother in a lot of ways.\n\nFor this woman she needs to learn to find peace in what life is and stop fighting what it is not.
 >The peer mentor said Moritz had “personally attacked” other students by expressing support for Trump\n\nYes, someone indicating the support of a presidential candidate is an attack /s. This shit really confuses me. I remember college. It was full of a bunch of immature little kids who barely understood the class registration system let alone government politics. I think this is the crux. These students don't understand what is going on so they do what immature people do, they get angry and lash out emotionally because they are scared of the unknown. They find little simplistic aspects of a subject to turn the idea into good v evil. \n\nWords are not violence and we can't let having a stance on a subject be construed as a violent act.
This is a good example of how entrenched people can get. Things might seems super weird to most people but given enough time some people can get so used to bird-brain behavior that it becomes normal to them.

This is a false hope on your part. BPA free doesn't mean that a plastic has no estrogen like chemicals in it. Also, the estrogen like properties have been shown to not affect people on a discernible level. The chronic effects require at least 150 years of exposure.
There was a loading screen game or maybe it was just a minigame for the Saga Saturn game Virtua Cop. It was Submarine or something. You played it before the actual game to raise the amount of lives you had in the game at the start. The submarine game was actually more fun than the actual game. Virtua Cop was really hard and too frustrating.
Cheap enough to not care to remember the plastic bag you bought last week. 
You might be right in that I did try hard to win the match. Ranked or not I still want to win. If those guys want to practice freestyling in a match against real players I showed them that it isn't going to go well if someone is wise to their efforts. I simply put in everything I could to win because that makes it fun for me. I wish I had the skill to freestyle like those guys but at the same time I can see that they were trying to play the game in a way that takes skill but isn't necessarily a path for success. I put the same effort in unranked as I do ranked because it is an opportunity to try new things I might hold back on in fear of failure. I wreaked those guys and proved that I can deal with  freestylers which I used to up my game in ranked. 
And your mother reeked of elderberries. 
I'm not saying you are wrong or right here but how do you figure:\n>On average, life is easier if you are a man than a woman\n\nGive me actual examples in a broad sense.
I wouldn't doubt that at all. I just hope that some of these guys just need to get their assess kicked to straighten out. Prison doesn't generally do that. It's unfortunate that they end up being shitty Marines but it might be better than them becoming better criminals in prison. Yet, they might become better criminals in the Marines too. I just don't know what to think about it.
No too long ago I was playing an unranked doubles game. The other team were two opponents essentially practicing freestyling, more accurately they were trying to guide the ball in from the high wall. I'm not a freestyler but rather a really aggressive power striker. The only way to stop these fools, given that my teammate was just flabbergasted by the insane aerials these guys were doing, was to demo the hell out of them and aerial the shots out of the sky. I had maybe 100+ boost pickups that game. Ultimately, we won because they had no defense. I said "gg" and all they can say was the game was "Shite" and that "I was a tryhard". Dude, you are the ones trying to dance, I just wanted to win the game. 
They put High Quality in the title yet I think a potato would be embarrassed. The title is a lie!

It wasn't just the direct use DDT either. The process to develop the chemical produced a lot of other chemicals, chiefly chlorobenzene and DDT. The is a site in Torrance, CA called [Montrose Superfund site](https://yosemite.epa.gov/r9/sfund/r9sfdocw.nsf/3dec8ba3252368428825742600743733/b7db9903773ec74188257007005e93ed) is one particular urban local that is still subjected to decades of groundwater contamination. It's important to know that DDT was illegal to use in the US in 1972 but was still allowed for manufacture. Montrose Chemical Corp operated until 1982.\n\nEdit: An added fact: Just to the East of the site, right on the other side of the 405 freeway there used to be a [nature preserve of sorts](https://www.google.com/maps/@33.855137,-118.2790531,3a,75y,341.88h,71.24t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sOAFfntY2UdBM44ErfQGGFA!2e0!7i13312!8i6656). It was famous for sportsmen to go duck hunting. And before 1938 it and what is now called Dominguez channel were called Ni**er Slough. "Slough" being an old timey word for channel.
I think it's a combination of the ridiculously slow speed limit in Bay Area and the large number of immigrants drivers.\n\nIf you are from other countries, speed limit is speed limit, and you get a ticket from the speed cams for going 5 over. It's obviously not true for 101 and 280 here.\n\nSo you have drivers here who drive 65 on 101 while being passed by people going 90, and wondering why the cops aren't arresting all of them. \n\nIt makes it extremely unsafe. The other day i noticed everyone was doing 90 on 280 and suddenly the traffic had to swirl around an Asian lady in the left lane going 70. I can only guess how scared she was lol.
SNL pretty much stands for Saturday Night Lynch at this point.
In a straight line maybe, but in overall dynamics the two cars will be crazily different. One will be a comfortable, quiet and smooth daily commuter and the other would be a track monster tuned for optimal handling and driver enjoyment.
What are you talking about? Apple never said they invented MP3 players or the smartphone. That aside, did you seriously think it's the same between marketing for a company and the way public is being mislead on important policies?\n\nLook, I know it's cool to claim Apple is a terrible company making overpriced stuff for people with no tech background, but as a software engineer who worked at Google, I can tell you almost everyone with a tech background in Silicon Valley think the exact opposite.\n\n

The "literally Hitler" crowd is only a small portion of the left (although a sizable portion of /r/politics), but we saw the [same thing from the right against Obama](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a7/Obama_Hitler_political_sign.jpg) as well.\n\nThat's the thing being POTUS, you can't just ignore half the country that don't like you and say "screw you all". That would ensure your place as being one of the worst presidents in history. Not a single US President has been this divisive in rhetorics. Obviously Trump wasn't a politician so he was not trained in "smooth talking", but it's obvious that a lot of his reaction was driven by his ego and emotion and not driven by rationality. \n
Yes, because freedom of press is obviously such a terrible idea that's only championed by the neocons.
So I'm a legal immigrant myself, just like you. May I ask why do you rate it so highly of an issue? I agree with you that illegal immigrants are what they are, illegal, I just can't see why it's such an important problem that it's worth all the other mess his presidency is bringing. 
Yes, and we should treat them respectively. But we have immigration laws for a reason, you don't attain the right to live here just by being a person.
I'm pretty sure he doesn't drive himself....
You have no idea what the evidence is. What if it's a phone recording of Putin? Now he'd know his phone is bugged. What if it's leak from within the FSB? Now Russia would know they have a traitor. Even a traced IP address would alert Russia of potential weakness in their security.\n\nYou seem to have no idea of how any of this work. In infosec professionals run something called "pen test", which stands for penetration test, and it's valuable because any success lets you know of your system's weakness.\n\nYou never want to let rival nations know what your intelligence agencies are able to gather, from both SIGINT and HUMINT level.\n\nAlso, may I ask what qualification do you have, in either national security or computer security or global intelligence gathering, that qualifies YOU to verify the validity of such evidence. What if they named a Russian mole? Can you double verify it by tracking him down in Moscow?
Well just like the Middle East, it becomes a real problem if you keep bombing them.

> Polls told us HRC would win in the biggest landslide victory we've ever seen.\n\nThat's literally not true. Polls predicted that Hillary was leading Trump by about 3% nation wide right before the election, which was exactly her margin of victory for popular votes.\n\nIn vast majority of states the polls were within margin of error. 
I confess that I consider myself a moderate liberal and I really think Kellyanne Conway deserves a lot of the mockery she received because she's just an amateur league spokesperson on a national stage.\n\nHowever I think there is a huge amount of crap she gets from the left simply because she's a woman. People mocked her skin, her makeup, her wardrobe, her appearances in general, and all that disgust me. This whole couch thing was already beyond stupid (just like Obama's tan suit, although that was a crime against fashion), and I have a strong feeling that this wouldn't have been nearly a big deal with anyone else doing the same thing.\n\nAnd of course,  the statement from the link isn't anything remotely acceptable, shame on him.
Nope, and if you read my earlier comments, you would see that I said I'm Pro-choice. I acknowledge that a fetus is a child, but I also do not think it has full right to life right out of the gate either.\n\nYes, I'm a pro-choice person who acknowledge that a fetus is a child. 
Right, gasoline is an amazing fuel that we spent 100 years+ perfecting ICEs to take advantage of it. The very fact that we can get the kind of performance we get in sports cars from literally *reliably exploding liquid in a confined space* speaks highly of the kind of engineering that goes into ICE design.\n\nThe tech bottleneck for ICE cars is the engine, whereas the tech bottleneck for EVs is the batteries themselves.\n\nAs far as performance characteristics goes, with AC induction motors the torque actually drops off as RPM climbs, that actually hurts the driving enjoyment and obviously track performance a bit. People rave about 0-60 performance of EVs, but remember on a race track you never do 0-60, it's almost always about shifting into the right gear and accelerate out of a corner with max power from at about 40-60mph. \n\nObviously in the future, batteries (or whatever energy storage) will get cheaper and get higher energy density, and ICEs will become completely obsolete from a technical perspective.\n\nI think in the future ICE cars will become toys for the rich, just like how I'm saving up for a $55k [Lange 1](https://www.hodinkee.com/articles/new-a-lange-and-sohne-lange-1-moon-phase-hands-on) when you can get a $20 Casio that's more accurate.
And Lynch didn't say otherwise under oath while testifying in front of the congress. Hillary proceeded to lose the election as well.\n\nI don't understand the point of this comparison.

China being absolutely hated by South Korea and Taiwan? How much do you know of the history there? Did you not know that China is the number one foreign investment destination for Taiwanese companies? \n\nSince when did US actually care about democracy?US was anti communist, but not Pro democracy. South Korea remained authoritarian until the 70s and Taiwan didn't have a presidential election until 1995, both countries had authoritarian governments. Didn't prevent US from being good friend with them.\n\nUS is officially an ally of Turkey and Saudi Arabia, how much freedom do you think there are in those countries?\n
>I would rather drive my Roadster than ANY OTHER CAR.\n\nWell obviously you are a big Tesla fan. Most car enthusiasts would take the Lotus Elise over a Roadster on any race track or mountain road. The Roadster isn't bad, but its body roll during hard cornering is pretty tragic for a small car of its size. Hell, I'll say the Model S manages its body roll better than the Roadster does, given its size.\n\nThere are objective measurements you can have when it comes to "driving dynamics". The roadster is just not anywhere near the top of the pack as far as sports cars go.\n\n
>Head to head, ICE really only excels at top speed tests, for now.\n\nThat's just not true, for any high end acceleration, such as 50-120, 60-100, 0-100, 0-120, 0-150, etc, electric motors don't hold a candle to ICE cars of similar price yet. For example the LaFerrari is 0.1s slower than P100DL at 0-60, but a whole 1.5s faster at 0-100.\n\nFrom 60mph, my M3 can out accelerate a P90DL.\n\nThe BMW M3 is a RWD sports car tuned for optimal handling, it will not be able to match Model 3's AWD 0-60, but will likely smoke it on the track and offers more driver engagement in a mountain road, simply due to better chassis tuning and being much, much lighter.
> It's hypocrisy we can't stand\n\nAnd I admire that, I'm a liberal and I absolutely cannot stand hypocrisy either. Double standards and hypocrisy are both the cause and results of hyper partisanship, as in people would rather do world class mental gymnastics before admitting that their side is wrong or not perfect.\n\nBut again, it may just be a human nature thing, because it's always easier to criticize people you don't agree with than any sort of self criticism.
I remember that Top Gear episode. I'm not saying the Roadster isn't decently quick on the track, but if you watch that episode, it falls behind during corners, and then catches up during the straight. As far as driving dynamics goes that's just plain terrible. \n\nThis is why a manual Mazda Miata is one of the best sports car on the planet, period. Even though a new Camry is quicker than it in 0-60 and an entry level Mustang would be faster on the track. It's all about engagement. \n\nObviously if you don't have any twisty roads to drive on then vehicle dynamics doesn't really matter. At that point a Mustang is as good as a Porsche and a Corvette is comparable to a McLaren and a Model S P100D is a solid match for a LaFerrari. \n\nSo you just reinforced my point, you love your Roadster *because* you no longer live the life of a car enthusiast. \n\nYou said you'd pick your Roadster over any other car, but other than being a convertible EV (a big plus, to be fair), I can't think of a *single thing* it does better than all other cars. 
Damn, all of that sound super nice, good for you! Be sure to invest in a good PSU, I almost cheaped out on mine until my friend's PSU fried his motherboard somehow...
None, it's a technology in a transient state and it's improving. But at its current state customers cannot get any tangible benefit *without compromising safety*.\n\n\n\n
>It out accelerates almost every car 0-45 and most cars 0-60, which is important if your live is lived going stop light to stop light.\n\nI really can't think of anyone with a sports car that floors their car at every single stop light/stop sign. Being dangerous aside, the amount you end up paying for tires would just be ridiculous. And why is it important? Can you not get to your destination without beating people in drag racing?\n\nFor daily driving anything that goes 0-60 in under 6 seconds is plenty quick, I have no clue where some people got this idea from that they need a P90D to be able to safely merge onto the highway from the onramp. \n\nDon't get me wrong, I'm getting a Model 3 as a daily and I'm looking forward to that all electric acceleration. But that doesn't make it a sports car.\n\n
After all these news recently, I'm just glad that Uber cars aren't navigated by the company's moral compass.\n
I wouldn't call 335is cheap speed....unless you mean the plural of 335i, otherwise at $60k with options the 335is isn't cheap :)\n\nEven the regular 335 are much more expensive than a Mustang GT.

CR-V isn't that high/large of a SUV, it's a compact SUV.\n\nThese days pretty much *all* luxury SUVs are very stable at 120mph+. 
Because it's unreasonable to be asking for public proof when it comes to national security issues. Yes I do think our intelligence agencies can be shady sometimes, but literally in the history of the world no government intelligence agencies release their capability to the public. Not in this country or any others. \n\nIf you remain convinced that absence of public evidence amounts to evidence of absence, then unfortunately nothing will change your mind.\n\nBut again, people like you and me don't run this country, we don't have a direct democracy, and the people who have access to those information do call the shots at the end of the day (even though they can make mistakes, but no system is perfect)
Fortunately what you think or not think has no bearing on reality.
They aren't even much quieter than modern luxury ICE cars, especially from the inside. Pretty much all luxury ICE cars have quieter interior at highway speed than a Tesla due to much better insulation alone.\n\nI rented a new 2017 A4 (a 40k car) for a ski trip and my passenger at one point asked me if the thing was electric. That turbo 4 was so smooth and quiet it's almost spooky. \n\nAt 80mph+ the wind/tire noise on a Model S is pretty embarrassing for a car of its price tag (especially bad for the 21" wheels) :/  In my dad's S class the carpet is thick and all the windows are double paned. That thing is unsettlingly quiet even at 90mph.\n\nBut again, ICE sports cars are much louder, sometimes intentional due to the customers expectation.\n\nBut when you are in a parking lot, you won't hear a EV or hybrid coming up from behind you.
The backseat of a 2016 S class. That thing is more comfortable than my bed, and I have a very nice bed. Love those [small head pillows](http://wardsauto.com/site-files/wardsauto.com/files/imagecache/galleryformatter_slide_penton/gallery_images/S-Class%20headrest%20pillows.jpg?1373924960).
> Perhaps but I don't think in politics.\n\nThat's the thing, I think politicizing everything these days made it very difficult for people to discuss and exchange ideas. Everyone thinks in politics it's about winning vs losing, us vs them, the right vs left and the righteous vs evil (of course the other side is evil). \n\nThat's stupid. I want to have an honest discussion on abortion, gay rights, fiscal policies, gun controls, etc etc without mentioning which candidate or party I care about. I want to see people being able to discuss them from a philosophical level, a moral level, a legal level, an economical level but *not a political level*. \n\nPersonally as a liberal who's very keen to listen to people with different ideas, I've found that nothing is better at teaching me new things than studying issues from a different angle. I've met countless smarter people who disagree with me on many things. \n\nIn fact, I call myself a moderate not because I don't have strong opinions, but because I can see both sides of the coin on many issues and I really can't make a clear judgement.\n\nThe thing is I think there is a large group of silent people on both sides who are like me, it's just that the more passionate/extreme left/right wing people are a lot more vocal on the Internet.
Exactly, and those actions were great. I do believe he has the right intention.\n\nHowever due to his impulsive personality he has been undermining his own action by getting into shouting matches with people on Twitter and act overly defensive against any criticism.\n\nBannon needs to go, he played a major role in how much of a mess Trump got himself in so quickly.
I'm not pretending to be dumb, but I really don't know what you mean by "filtering". Would you kindly explain that concept? Thanks.
As a modern president, if your agenda requires you to literally slaughter half the country, then the problem is with your agenda, not the country.
He claimed that he had the most electoral college votes since Ronald Regan.\n\n
Yes, more viewership and public reach does in fact give you more access as far as media goes. Shocking right? \n\nBut I do see logic in your argument. So sure, why not split the spots between small liberal outlets and small conservative outlets then? \n\nWhat? All the small outlets that got in were Trump's favorites? That's just a pure coincidence right? Or did you mean we should only give access to small outlets that's *liked* by the administration.\n\n
> We cannot forget that we, as conservatives, try to stand for the truth, stand for facts\n\nI have to insist that most people on the left value truth and facts as well. People still disagree because very often truth and facts are muddy and complicated problems are seldom black and white, but often in different shades of gray. \n\nWe have to be comfortable with the fact that smart and honest people with good intentions can *still* be wrong on things because the world is a very complex place. \n\nThere are crazy people on /r/politics and obviously /r/T_D has its share of lunatics. For whatever bullshit the extreme left are throwing at Trump we've to remember people on the right literally started the "birther" thing and calling our President Hitler [isn't anything new](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a7/Obama_Hitler_political_sign.jpg).\n\nDon't get me wrong, I probably disagree with most of your opinions as a conservative and I will probably come across as an elitist asshole if we start debating, but I will always believe that most people on the conservative sides are honest and kind people who want what's best for them, their family, and their fellow countrymen.
I'm a pretty hardcore car enthusiast, and I absolutely love Tesla these days. EVs are pretty damn cool and I am eyeing a Model 3 as a daily driver as my next car.\n\nObviously for real driving dynamics and "emotional appeal" no current EVs can match a true sports car, but you can love both.\n\nOne thing I disagree with a lot of Tesla fans is that electric motors are somehow this new/advanced tech when compared to ICE due to its simplicity and efficiency. In reality AC motors have existed for almost as long as ICE has and I absolutely appreciate the beautiful engineering that goes into something like [this](http://media.emercedesbenz.com.s3.amazonaws.com/magazine/wp-content/uploads/amg_05.jpg). \n\nBut again, I'm a weirdo who loves both my Apple Watch and my collection of mechanical timepieces. I have a degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering but I'm more drawn to mechanical stuff.

No, but you asked what lie he presented during this press conference. There is video recording of him saying that line.\n\nDo you not agree it's factually false? I'm not quite sure what you are trying to get here.
No, Autopilot is a technically correct name for the software, however it is not appropriate in this case since the general consumers are not familiar with aviation technology.\n\nWhat's technically correct and what's appropriate are very often two different things. 
Let's start with the common grounds. Despite what many people may think, there are more common values shared between people on each side than values they disagree on. Hell, many of them are families, coworkers and friends. People just tend to focus on the differences.\n\nI'm pretty moderate, and right now I see both sides are growing further and further apart. Which is sad because very often people don't disagree on *what* they want to achieve, such as strong economy, good education for our kids, less corruption in the government, but *how* we implement it.\n
Yeah, the Model 3 will definitely have faster 0-60 than a M3, for being AWD alone gives you a big advantage.\n\nBut if you look at the option list for a M3, it includes the $8k ceramic brakes, and even a base model M3 will no doubt smoke a top end model 3 on any race track. It will be able to accelerate faster on the track (remember, you don't do 0-60 on the track, you do 50-120, 40-150, etc), turn better and brake faster.\n\nThe two cars aren't comparable.
Ok, I'm pretty socially liberal and I still find identity politics like this to be beyond stupid.\n\nWe live in an absurd environment that we will be forced to have a "diverse cast" to portray the Italian mafia in a Godfather remake.\n\nDiversity for the sake of diversity just trivializes the real issue that is racism and does nobody any good.
It has been references a lot actually, hell I have done it since I own a M3 myself.\n\nIronically sometimes I brought up my M3 to tell people how the car is *not* comparable to any Tesla, and why I got a M3 over a Model S, lol
Man, I hope VW's future self driving cars aren't navigated by the company's moral compass.
Just for comparison, a state of the art Formula One car has such tremendous braking power that all cars on the grid can do 0-100-0 in less than 5 seconds, that's almost half has much time as the fastest car on this list.
People from all political spectrums show signs of hypocrisy, in fact they show that for things outside of politics.\n\nApplying a harsher standard to people you don't like and an easier standard for your *own team* is just human nature.\n\nI really hate when people claim moral superiority on either side, /r/politics pisses me off for the same reason.
Yes, because NYT, CNN and BBC are such small time outlets that spaces have to saved for real major outlets such as Breitbart and Washington Times.\n\nStop with your bullshit, you made it sound like it's a decision driven by impartial logic to save spots for major outlets, when it couldn't be further from the truth.
I'm saying none of the above, the following was your question:\n\n>what lies did he present?\n\nAnd I gave you my answer, no more, no less, and I am not going to speculate on the reason why he didn't tell the truth.
Exactly, democracy is only accepted because it's the only way for people without private armies and billions of dollars to have a voice at all. But it's just a mean to the end and people don't really value it that much as long as they win and the other side loses.\n\nIf we put up a poll in /r/politics asking if they would support banning Trump voters from voting in the next election, I have a feeling quite a large percentage of them would be supporting it.
Obviously Chinese military isn't on the same level as US, but they are by no means "very poorly equipped". That hasn't been true for at least 10 years.\n\nJust buying Russian scraps? Have you looked at the J20 fighter or the Type 52D destroyer or the DF-41 ICBM? In many areas Chinese technology exceeds Russian ones, especially when it comes to electronics and aerospace tech these days. \n\nSure they still get a long way to go to match US, but with their current capability they can ensure any conflict nearby will be costly to the Americans. \n\nChina isn't a military super power yet, but they aren't a huge military force with nothing but poorly trained farmers equipped with Soviet era gear either.\n\n\n
> compared to Hillary who leaked classified info to ISIS, then illegally covered it up.\n\nAnd she did that while molesting kids at her favorite pizza joint right?\n\n
I don't understand your logic. They did present their evidences to Obama, Trump, lawmakers from both parties and nobody, not even Trump questioned the validity of such evidence. \n\nGoing by your logic, nothing is real unless you *personally* review the evidence (and obviously you think you have the expertise and experience to validate such evidence). Since that is unlikely to happen due to your lack of security clearance, no reports from our intelligence agencies will be real, ever.\n\nDo you think we should just disband all the intelligence agencies of this country right here, right now because they don't do any real work since *you* don't get to see the "evidence"?\n\nLet's be honest here, you deem this report from our intelligence agencies "fake" not because you didn't see the evidence, but because the report is something you don't want to believe in. Even if they publicized the top secret evidence you will just join the many who claimed that they fabricated them, which is well within their capability in the first place.\n
The current Model S is already very good when it comes to lateral grip and balance, I think it's even better than the standard 5 series these days (haven't driven the new 5er though).\n\nYou aren't gonna get any good steering feel from electric steerings, unfortunately, even my M3 pales in comparison in that regard when compared to my last gen 335. \n\nI think Tesla don't have the resources to go after enthusiasts like you and I. Their "P" version is always just about faster 0-60, with no change in any suspension since for most people, 0-60 == performance. I'm very fine with that since I want a Model 3 as a daily commuter, and I'll probably get a Boxster S as a weekend fun car.\n\nOh, Alfa has always had some sort of heritage in building sports cars, most recently the 4C was very well reviewed. For the Quadrifoglio, that thing has a V6 version of the V8 engine from a Ferrari California, and I'm not least shocked that Alfa did an excellent job tuning the car :)
Those two cars aren't remotely comparable. If the Model S was a good trade in this case, then the 911 was the wrong car in the first place.\n\nThis reminds me of that Ferrari owner who said he loved his new Model S more because it was quieter and more comfortable and had back seats....\n\nDude, a Honda Accord fits all those descriptions.
Hey, being pessimistic has its perks: you are either proven right or you are pleasantly surprised.
Right, but Rolex itself isn't a top end brand。\n\nReal high end brands start at around 50k for their cheapest versions and go into the millions for special pieces/collectable ones.
The M4 GTS is only 0.2s faster 0-60 than a $65k base M3 thought, it's completely tuned for track performance.\n\nPeople on this sub need to stop thinking that other car manufactures focus on 0-60 as much as Tesla does.
Wouldn't the GT4 be a terrible daily though? Just get both :)
Maybe a bounty reward? I dunno, use the budget for the wall to reward people who report employers that hire illegal immigrants.\n\nJust a random thought, probably not a good idea.
>When the owner of Twitter says to kill white people\n\nOh? Do you have a source on that? Thanks.
That...that's not a M4.
Jesus, you really think the whole China is as bad as a bad day in Beijing every day of the year?\n\nMost places outside the northern industrial zones are ok half the time of the year as far as pollution goes. Not great, but it varies a lot depends on the time of the year.
Yep we do. Vast majority of them were within the margin of error and most of them predicted Hillary's popular vote win.\n\nThe only state where polls were significantly wrong was Wisconsin, and that was due to lack of polling data near the close of the race.\n\nTL;DR Polls were correct, it was the media that mis-represented poll data.
I agree with you, because high end sports cars are just toys. Their merit are subjective after all.  I have no doubt that one day Porsche or Ferrari will make a killer sports car that's pure EV. It will be very different, but it can still be awesome. \n\nIn the end, the more options there are, the better. 
Like you said, he went to war with the other half of the country and unified the country, he didn't *ignore* them.\n\nI guess Trump can go down history as a good President if he round up half the people in this country and just execute all of them, I guess that's one way to make sure he gets really high approval rating.\n\n
>That's very true. But showing hypocrisy while trying to take the moral high ground is actually worse.\n\nI find it to go hand in hand most of the time. After all, claiming moral high ground isn't something patented only to the left. \n\n>Seems more like laziness to me.\n\nOf course it's laziness, because it takes time to be self-reflective and think through your own position in a critical way. It's much easier to blame all the bad things on people you vilified in the first place. \n\n> Probably have psychological issues.\n\nI think a large percentage of the population are plagued by the same type of such issues, and sometimes the symptoms are different because of different belief/background. It's just what we are as a species :/\n\nBut call me an optimist, I still think it's possible for people from both sides to actually communicate and discuss real issues in a constructive manner, and I think most people agree on more things than they disagree on. 
> I don't know how you can call her an amateur league spokesperson after she carried a man like Donald Trump into the White House.\n\nShe ran a fantastic campaign, and obviously helped Donald won the election. But I wouldn't say it's because of her public appearance on TV. She was the campaign manager and much of her contribution was beyond what the public saw.\n\nFurther more, now Trump is in the WH, it's a whole different ball game. The few times where she said something and then immediately contradicted by the the White House *in the same day* is just plain embarrassing.
There was no spin. He literally said CNN and other main stream medias are all "fake news". Obviously he didn't mean to include Fox and Breitbart. \n\nSo I guess technically what he meant was "media I don't like are the enemies of the American people"
May I ask why do you think Democrats "lost pretty big"? As far as election goes it was a pretty close one. The key states that Hillary lost she lost by &lt;1% of the votes and she won the popular votes by a decent margin.\n\nI understand the Democrat party failed on multiple levels this past election, but I don't see any evidence suggesting they lost in a big way or how the country is now suddenly more conservative than before.\n\nI think if someone like Joe Biden ran he would have won the election, but that wouldn't mean the country is suddenly more liberal either.
[3.8 seconds] (http://www.caranddriver.com/reviews/2015-bmw-m3-dct-automatic-test-review)\n
That's just plain not true. China has poured a lot more effort into their navy and air force than army. Look at all the money they are spending on the new destroyers and aircraft carriers and new ballistic subs. The new Type 52D  destroyer has an Aegis like system and  active phased array radar guiding a VLS filled with long range SAM and AS cruise missiles. And they are building 16 of this type of ship, and the construction for the newer Type 55 has already begun.
Sure, as an entry level sedan yes. If you read my comment I think P70D will no doubt be faster than a M3 in 0-60, due to AWD and electric motors, but it's pretty far stretched to think that somehow Tesla has the ability to build a car that's comparable dynamically to the vaunted M3. M3 has completely different suspension/brakes/steering than the stock 3 series, but Tesla don't update any of those for their P models.\n\nJust like how the Model S P90D or P100D is faster than a Panamera Turbo and M5 in straight line, but completely falls short in actual overall driving engagement and vehicle dynamics, let alone track performance.
When he tweets out the things he tweets, such as calling people enemies and keep making fun of Hillary for losing and her supporters for supporting a losing side, it just doesn't help.\n\nIf he can pretend to be humble for a bit and actually try not to overreact when people criticize him, it would go a long way in easing people's animosity.\n\nIt's just a bad feedback loop at this point.
> All I want is to see the proof it happened. Shouldn't be hard to produce if there is so much of it, right?\n\nIt wasn't hard to produce, in fact they produced it to all the people with security clearance. You also have not seen the photos of Osama Bin Laden's dead body, do you also think he's still alive?\n\n>Or do you also believe that us plebs are to low to see real evidence before claiming Russia, or anyone, did anything?\n\nOf course that's what I believe. Revealing full evidence from the intelligence community, including our sources and our capability, to the general public is nothing short of insanity. We have a representative democracy so that is not necessary.\n\n\n>And remember the WMD's in Iraq?\n\nYes I do remember the WMD mess. In fact there were a lot of debates within the intelligence agency on whether there were WMDs in Iraq. The Bush/Cheney administration cherry-picked the data and used it to support their war. Iraq has WMD was not a conclusion that's agreed by FBI, NSA and CIA and all the other intelligence agencies.\n\n> you deem this report from our intelligence agencies the truth because it fits your narrative. Because its something you want to believe in.\n\nNo, I deem this report believable because everyone who has seen the report believes it. Including Republicans and Trump himself. Even Trump himself does not deny the existence of evidence like you do.\n\n\n
Hypocrisy is prevalent amongst Democrats, Republicans and Independents alike, liberals and conservatives, in this country and other countries.\n\nPeople always find it easier to find faults and criticize people they don't agree with. Sure a lot of these controversy surrounding Trump could just be much ado about nothing, but ask yourself seriously, if Hillary were the President and she were in the same position, you don't think the Republicans would be asking for heads to roll?\n\nAlso, we only have one President in this country right now and it's Donald Trump. Lowering standard for him, the most powerful person in the country, if not the world, because someone else *also did something similar* is just not a logical thing to do. 
LOL @ Shinji being guidance counselor.
I'm sorry, he literally said "that was the biggest electoral college win since Ronald Reagan". He didn't mean to say what you said, because otherwise he wouldn't have had to backtrack it afterwards.
Don't add too much.  A little goes a long way.
As far as I can tell there are no statistics suggesting illegal immigrants commit crime at a higher rate than non-immigrants or legal immigrants from the same area.\n\nI don't understand what you mean by "destroy our communities". Is there anything they do that's different than legal immigrants? \n\nI do think they potentially put a strain on our social welfare system, but there are no studies suggesting it's causing enough of a problem to warrant drastic actions anytime soon. \n\nYou also skipped many positive economical impacts caused by illegal immigrants.\n\nEither way, I'm not defending them. I just think given the many problems this country faces, illegal immigration is so low on the actual impact that it's an emotional issue for most people, instead of a rational issue.
Do you know who made the camera that shot Ant Man and who did the special effects for Ant Man?
> but democrats are unable to admit that Obama was a shitty president despite him leaving them in a worse position than Bush left the GOP.\n\nObama definitely left the party in a bad place at the end of his presidency. However the country viewed him favorably (60%+ approval rating, most moderates loved him as well) because he left the *country* in a much better shape than Bush did.\n\nSome people here are too young to remember how bad the Great Recession was at the end of 2008 and beginning of 2009. The economy costed GOP the 2008 election, simple as that.
You made it sound like the stock market hasn't been doing super well for the past 6-7 years. 
Liberals make up about half the American people, or do you not count them as your fellow countrymen because you don't agree or like them?
Then can you please explain what "filtering" means? I have seriously never heard of that term in this context before. Thank you.
If you could open a chain restaurant, what would the theme be? Some menu items? And, of course, what would you call it?

Oh, right. Trump is Hitler! Everything he touches turns to dog shit, even the things I wanted another candidate to do before the election!\n\nAm I a good boy yet?
Holy shit this is cool. Just spent way too much time researching the Nazca lines. I'd heard about Greenpeace screwing up some lines a few years back, but didn't really look into it. Didn't sound like a big deal. This is fucking awesome.
Huh. That *does* line up with the personality type that wouldn't find Andy Daly funny.
There was a switcher, but apparently no director. Keep one of them on Spicer, keep the other one on the interviewer! Jesus christ it's not hard.

No, yeah, I've seen them
Nice, thank you for the link! It's weird seeing him in this context. This is his comfort zone.
I worked at a Wawa. We did the "free coffee for cops" thing, too (which makes sense, it kept them coming back pretty frequently), and I'd ring up homeless folks as cops sometimes. Regular rad folks had to pay their way, but Jerry was covered.\n\nUnrelated, but one time I walked in the bathroom (for context, I worked third shift, this was like 3 in the morning so not a high-traffic time) and there were four homeless dudes in there. Three sitting on their backpacks around the toilet, the fourth on the toilet reading scripture. \n\nIt was nice. Little hobo church, on a cold-ass night.
Haha thanks
I hadn't heard about the water gun on the wall, but I heard about the second bit.\n\nI feel some sympathy for Spicer. He doesn't seem like a bad person. He's trying very hard to do an impossible job. Sometimes it makes him look bad, but he's not there to represent himself or his own views, he's there as a representative for the White House, which is a fucking circus. \n\nI expect this White House to go through many press secretaries, blaming them for the issues with messaging when really it's such a deeply-rooted problem with this administration that the best goddamned press secretary in the world (or, alternatively, CJ Cregg) would have trouble in that press room.
It's already extremely popular, and widely, easily available. *Especially* in schools. It was so goddamned easy to get weed in high school.\n\nIf anything, legalizing and regulating it will lower that occurrence or it won't change. Weed was a hell of a lot easier to get than booze when I was underage. Legalize, regulate, tax. It's a dumb thing to lock people up over (wasting tax money), and there's so much tax money to be gained by legalizing.
Hmm. Good to know. I wonder if it works fine without that, seeing as plenty of people will be playing with pro controllers on both Wii U and Switch
That really *was* something else. Very, very cool. I like the touch of the "inverted" sweatshirt, too.
I didn't know Friendly's and Waffle House were regional. Both worth checking out! Friendly's has decent quesadillas. Don't get a burger with sauce pre-applied though, get that shit on the side. They go pretty overboard in my experience.
The comedy albums are great. The paywall is just frustrating in so many ways. But god damn if ADPPP season 2 wouldn't make me throw down for a year-long subscription.
My dog's terrified of the stair gate, and trash bags, really any plastic bags, and strawberries (the sound, not the berry -- making fart noises with your lips, for the uninitiated. She uses her paws a lot, and whenever I give her strawberries she just slaps me in the face and puts her ears down. I don't abuse this fear. Much. She's the best.)
I've never heard of Ricki Lake, but after googling around a bit -- kids are dumb. I might only be seeing more recent pictures of her, but she looks great.\n\n[I can see it, too.](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/05/Ricki_Lake_LF.JPG) Your face is kinda similar.
How's it unfortunate? I mean, people finding loopholes and getting good deals is awesome, but obviously the companies should work to prevent it.
Haha good call. Done and doner.
Oh yeah, I don't feel *too* bad for him. He knew, to some degree, what he was getting into. But I can't help feeling a bit of sympathy for someone pounding their head against the wall with an impossible task.\n\nI'm sure he thought Trump would get less ridiculous once the campaign was over. A lot of people did. Now he's got this job and has to try to do his best at it, even though it's a fucking ridiculously Herculean task.
> Trump is actually extremely eloquent, sometimes he slips up and says a word 98% percent of the population doesn't understand.\n\nDo you have any examples of his eloquence? Pretty much any video I see of him from over the decades, he just sounds the same.
I mean, alright. He's made me laugh hundreds of times, and ADPPP is one of the funniest podcasts I've ever listened to. So there's that.
This was a really great ep. The raps at the end were some of the best in a while.\n\nBut what was up with the cuts? There were two cuts that I noticed. Just wondering if anyone can give some context.
Hoh boy, it's kinda weird how deep that rivalry can run. Sheetz is *okay,* but I'm pretty sure I could lose some friends saying that. 
Oh I know it baby
Huh, good to know.
The Eric Andre Show, Check It Out! with Dr. Steve Brule, seconding Nathan For You if you haven't seen it.\n\nNot sure I'd consider it alt comedy, but I really enjoy Black Jesus. For that matter, Trailer Park Boys and The Boondocks (created by the two creators of Black Jesus).\n\nCommunity if you haven't seen it. Thirding Nathan For You.
> I've done my research, and there has been a shocking, downright crazy increase in crimes in Sweden.\n\nIf you've done your research, you should be able to provide it.\n\nYou can say it's just for laughs, but you're clearly trying to make a point. You said you've done the research, so someone asking for a source shouldn't be a big deal.\n\nI'm not calling you out or saying you're wrong. I have no idea about the crime rate in Sweden. I see two people saying two entirely different things, but you're the one who made the initial argument (whether in the form of a meme or not). You say you've done the research, it shouldn't be hard to back this up.
Nah, not for a while. I just picked up a Wii U like a month ago. I think that's how I'll handle Nintendo launches from now on.\n\nWould've sucked to have the Wii U while it was getting little to no action, but now I get things cheaper and there's a decent-sized library of great games. I've been having a blast with it.\n\nI'll play Zelda on there, and wait for the Switch to either get a really great library going, or for the end of its cycle. \n\nI was really hoping for the Switch presentation to sell me on it, but the price point and very small selection of games I'd actually like to play just solidified my decision to get a Wii U. Ordered it the next day.
Holy shit, the black Spice Girl was called Scary Spice?\n\nHooo boy
That's fair, but I feel like it's kinda flipped on its head with Nathan For You. *He* is the punchline, 99% of the time. The normal people are usually the straight man and/or say something a bit embarrassing under the pressure of being on camera.\n\nThat's one of the reasons I love the show so much. I personally really like the "cringe" factor-type of shows, I like feeling uncomfortable while watching something for some reason, and having the joke be on the host of the show for once is a nice change of pace.

Hi there! Not sure if a percentage of potential (currently theoretical) earnings count as payment here.

With minors? In my second bit, I was specifically talking about its availability to minors and in schools. Sorry I didn't make that clear.\n\nI'm sure the usage from adults go up when legalized. You can just go to a store and buy it. Not everyone wants to deal with the black market and potential arrest. I know people who have been arrested for it before, so they avoid it, but if it was legalized they would love to partake again. I know other people who can't afford to put their job at risk by enjoying something in their own personal time.\n\nSo yeah, I don't have any trouble believing usage goes up for adults.
I picked up Wind Waker HD on the Wii U about a month ago to dip my toes in the Zelda pond before diving into BoTW. (Never played 'em growing up, only played a bit of Twilight Princess, which I wasn't too into.) Really, really cool game.\n\nStill haven't beaten it, but I'm excited as hell for BoTW now.
Shit man, I roll my eyes at Besser and I *agree* with him most of the time. But yeah, it's all about the attitude. I don't think any Earwolf shows go past "poking fun." Something like Harmontown might be a bit harder for a right-leaning person to swallow, but even then, he'll make fun of himself and knows he doesn't really know what he's talking about.\n\nHard Nation is a goodie, but I could see it being annoying. They poke fun at both sides, but the scales are definitely tilted a bit.
Is this an episode of "let's make fun of the disadvantaged?"
He didn't say it was okay or right. In the comment you're replying to, he actually said "it doesn't make any of this shit right."
They hit 11 officers, and 6 civilians were caught in the cross-fire. Even if all 6 of those civilians were shot by the robbers, 17 hits out of 1,100 shots is pretty fucking bad.\n\nBut I don't know if they actually shot 1,100 times, or if they just had 1,100 rounds on-hand. [This picture](http://projects.dailynews.com/north-hollywood-shootout/img/noho-shootout-infographic.jpg) doesn't make it clear, and [the article it comes from](http://projects.dailynews.com/north-hollywood-shootout/) doesn't seem to mention it (at least not from a ctrl+f of 1,100)
> I mean, what do you expect him to say, "Believe me. I've seen some reports in my briefings on Sweden and it's not pretty."\n\nYes? Why not? That's not giving away anything specific. Everyone is aware that he has access to better information.\n\n> He saw something in the news and brought it up in a rally. Where is the moral sin there?\n\nThere are three possibilities --\n\n1) He misinterpreted something he saw on the news, didn't bother to fact check it, and reported it as fact to his huge audience that believes everything he says.  \n2) He mis-spoke in a super obvious and easy to avoid way.  \n3) He just straight-up lied.\n\nI see 1 or 2 as more likely than 3, but none of them look good on him.

Oh man, I'd vote for Gabbard in a fucking heartbeat.\n\nI'm a big supporter of Bernie and most of his policies, and I don't really know a whole lot about Ellison (I should read up more on him), but most of the things I hear aren't great. I haven't really been keeping up with the DNC stuff, so I don't know who he's up against, but I dunno. As I said, I need to read up on it more. The election kind of wore me out.\n\nBut yeah, Gabbard would be a great pick for a nominee. She checks so many boxes, and just seems like a genuinely good person.
Nah though
True that.\n\nI'd imagine you'd have to have that mindset, or one like it, to be a right-leaning person who enjoys alt comedy. No way are any of those "libruls are cancer!" folks getting into and enjoying shit like Improv4Humans.
> but what makes you think such outlets are prohibited for him to get information from?\n\nIt's not so much as they should be prohibited, but that he shouldn't be relying on them and parroting their reporting.\n\nHe (theoretically, whether he chooses to access it or not) has way more information available to him than any given cable news network. He shouldn't be poorly attempting to repeat what they say.
Although, to be fair, he would also say that if you said "are you drunk?"
Oh, you weren't being glib.
I only played a little bit of Limbo, but felt the same way you did. Just didn't click for me, even though it checked a lot of boxes and I *should* have been into it.\n\nI haven't checked out Inside yet because of worries that it'd be the same. Good to know that's not necessarily the point.
> but some puzzles require the game pad (one so far for me)\n\nHow did the puzzle require the game pad, without spoilers?\n\nI thought it was just "tap here to play on game pad," and that was the end of it. What actual usage does the game pad have in-game?

When you get to the puzzle, it says something along the lines of "you have to use the game pad for this." No alternative method, pro controller doesn't do anything. I was playing with the pro controller and had to switch over for the puzzle.
I hadn't thought about this, and I'm sure they're not really aware of this place, but I really hope that if they make it out to the east coast they try out some Wawa.\n\nIt's a convenience store, so not really a chain restaurant, but their deli sandwiches and other foods are the biggest draw. (Other than gas and smokes.) It's pretty good food for the price, better than I'd usually expect at a place like that, and there are a decent amount of options.\n\nI lived in Seattle for a brief period, and having lived in PA my whole life, the absence of Wawa was very noticeable. I'd also just quit working at a Wawa to move out there though, so I wasn't missing it *too* much.\n\nBut yeah. Do Wawa, guys. It's good food. Don't get the cheesesteak. (Or do. I love it, but it's really not a cheesesteak.)
Isn't that how it is with all consoles? Not to say that makes it less shitty, but I don't think I can buy a game from the PSN store on PS3 and also get the PS4 version.
Ha! Shit, weird seeing you out of your /r/earwolf cage. Go get us more AMAs!\n\nFor real though, I don't lean right on most things. I just like getting info from all sorts of sources, talking to people about their views, and the community on this sub is pretty good most of the time. I'm not big on echo chambers, but just about everywhere these days is one, so I try to at least diversify the echo chambers I spend time in.
Maybe our president shouldn't be sleep-deprived and should be able to properly contextualize his statements, when he has such a large audience and so many people take him at his word.\n\nIf this was a simple error of language on his part, it was an easy one to avoid. If he truly misinterpreted a story he'd seen on Fox News and represented it as fact, well... Either way, it's not something to be proud of.
Ohh okay, I didn't know that about the Switch pro controller. That's pretty neat.
It might be because I'm generally a quick talker. I dunno, I've never really paid attention to this specific thing, that's just how I say it.\n\nIf I say the word "historic" on its own, or at the beginning of a sentence, I pronounce the "h," but if it's in the middle of a thought I guess I kind of glaze over the "h," so "an" has always felt right.
Seems about as unlikely a thing to see as Trump speaking eloquently. It's a simile. A whale doesn't belong there, much like words past a fifth-grade level don't seem to belong in Trump's mouth.\n\nAgain, I don't necessarily doubt that this has happened. His speaking style could be manufactured for appeal. It just seems like a very long game, since he's been more or less speaking the same way for decades. If you have video of Trump speaking eloquently, using words that 98% of the population don't understand, I'd like to see it.
Oh man, Harmontown throwin' down. That's awesome.
I think you're missing some context here. Look up what's gone down with Milo the past few days, and the video of Takei talking about similar things.
THEY HAD A BABY!?\n\nHoly shit I've been out of it too long! 
Shit, did Cleo die? I haven't listened in a while.
Oh neat, this sounds great. I don't really keep up with console exclusives. I'll have to grab this one when I eventually get a PS4 for RDR2. Thanks!
Pretentious? I thought it just made sentences roll smoother.\n\n[Just recorded a sample with it both ways.](https://instaud.io/MFi) The second way just feels better to me. The "a historic" feels like a bit of a roadblock in the sentence, feels unnatural.
No kidding! I didn't think it'd been *that* long. Fuck, good for them, but that does suck about Cleo. 
I actually haven't seen MacGruber. That one kinda slid past me. I should get on it.
Nice! I'm pretty sure if you talk to anyone from the area long enough, Wawa's gonna make its way into the conversation.

There are some puzzles that require motion controls. I've only come across one temple so far that required it, but I'm sure there are more
I have a seething dislike for Trump, but to say there's *nothing* good to say is a bit of a stretch.\n\nI'm a fan of us backing out of TPP. I'm also hopeful for his plans to rebuild, as Bernie would say, "our crumbling infrastructure." (Though not crossing my fingers on that happening, or happening in a way that I would prefer.) The lobbying ban is good stuff, if enforceable.\n\nThat's about it though, that I can think of. Everything otherwise has been a pretty significant shit-show.
It is technically *potential* compensation, right? Minimum payment of $5 to post here, but if someone does this work for them and the project doesn't raise any money, they could be offering 100% and it would still be zero.\n\nI think, at the very least, they should offer $5 + the percentage. $5 to get your foot in the door, and for anyone who's willing to take this risk to get *something* out of it before the percentage actually means anything.\n\nOr just offer what the work is worth. If you're getting ready to launch a "tech campaign," you should be willing to put some of your money in to bring it together. Offering a percentage of money that doesn't yet exist is disrespectful to the work being done.
Yes, absolutely love it. I made my way through all of the public access shows last year before watching the cable show. Both iterations are fantastic, but the public access years are really hard to top. Absolutely anything could happen, and they took full advantage of it. (Although, as mentioned, the Paul Scheer/Jason Mantzoukas episode on the cable iteration is *so* good.)\n\nAlso, everyone on it is just really great. I loved Murph's recurring bit with the cult, and Human Fish's whole arc, all the returning audience guests and callers, just the *concept* of the "random" panelist, which had some mixed results but was mostly really really good.
Can I request an extension?
Yes, agreed!\n\nI'm glad that most of the comedians on here are unknown to me for two reasons -- one, as you said, it introduces me to new talent, some of which are ridiculously good. Two, it's kind of the same thing they were going for in the original Star Wars, where they hired relatively unknown actors so you would just associate them with *that* role. I'm not listening to Hello from the Magic Tavern and thinking "PFT is killing it as this archer!" I'm just thinking "This archer is great!" It feels more organic, and more like a world of its own.\n\nI don't think I'd enjoy it any less if that wasn't the case, but it's a nice bonus.
Didn't think of it. Yeah, it's a bit hokey, but like you said, not a big deal. It's only happened for me once so far, and it was a short segment. 
Nice work! That's awesome
Yeah, I'm with you. I'm pretty far left, but I've never been big on Maher. That said, the MJ thing was an obvious joke. Not a great joke, but he was fucking around.\n\nThe other clip is really gross, though. Can't imagine how anyone can defend that shit. In jail for love? He's a fucking 14 year old kid. "How can a woman rape a man?" was a doozie.\n\nI hope Maher has pulled his head out of his own ass on this particular issue since. I also hope this lands him in some hot water, as it did with Milo. Fuck this guy.
Did you have McDonalds' angus burgers? They unfortunately had a pretty short run, but they were so good! It was like a real burger! I love their quarter pounders now and then, tastes better than their regular doubles or whatever, but man, that angus burger was somethin else.\n\nNot really related, just drunk and now craving McDonalds. Vending machine microwavable fish sound goddamned demonic, but I have a pretty major distaste for seafood in any form.
Alright yeah, "an historic" with a hard "h" sounds weird. I assumed anyone who said "an" didn't give the "h" much airtime.
Wait, so do I. Is that not right? You don't pronounce the "h" very much, so it's mostly a vowel sound starting the word.
Oh man, microwavable burgers? That must have been awful.
...no? Was I being unreasonable? It's not that I don't believe it, but I'd like to see it. It'll be like seeing whale in an office building.
Nobody's saying it balances it out. At all. The guy I responded to said "there's nothing good to say about Trump," which is just false. There are many, ***many*** more bad things to say about him, but to say that there isn't a single good thing he's done is disingenuous.
Good pull! Very relevant, and a great sketch to boot.

This is completely tangential, but growing up my best friend's dad was a plastic surgeon, people get it in their head that a nip here and a tuck there and another cup size will make them the person they are supposed to be, it never works that way. My friend's dad was very selective about his actual cosmetic surgery (he did a lot of reconstruction at the hospital but he did have a small cosmetic private practice). It is very very *very* common for plastic surgeons to be sued after their work because people that hate their bodies will hate the changes when it doesn't change the way they feel about themselves. \n\nPeople can also become addicted to plastic surgery ever seeking more modifications.\n\nI think this is very relevant to the transgender debate. Once you open that Pandora's box and begin to alter yourself chasing your ideal, you'll never be able to stop or you'll sink into anger and depression  when it fails.

Never played Star Wars: Battlefront, have you?
That's going too far, maybe just slightly gruntled.
It's almost like the universe of star wars is a morally grey blob. I see no problems here.
Anyone that actually knows anything about history and star wars knows that they were inspired by German Shock Troops in WW1.  
I mean in this instance, it isn't wrong
They didn't need to destroy any planet to crush the Rebellion. They should've made a bigger armada of Star Destroyers (those big battleships). That would've been perfect. The Rebel Alliance was drained from battle. It wouldn't have lasted, specially if Thrawn was in command. But no, Sheev needed a planet exploder... And, of course, it started a chain of events that lead to Luke Skywalker becoming a Jedi... Palpatine's arrogance was his doom waaaay before Episode VI.

True.  Proof why a over bearing central government doesnt work
Nothing is inherently evil, it is one's thinking about it which makes it so.
As opposed to the other Imperial costumes, which were worn exclusively by white males (surprised star wars is allowed at all). Almost as if the Empire wasnt supposed to be representative of a "glorious eutopia".\n\nEdit: Perhaps I should re-iterate: I think this ban is hilariously idiotic. Especially because its not like only the stormtroopers could be considered "problematic" by snowflakes. I am not condoning the ban or seriously using the phrase "white male". I would have thought posting on r/conservative would have made that obvious.
It is not just silly it is ignorant.
In old canon, Sheev needed a Death Star to fight the Yuuzhan Vong invasion when that came about. That's why he sent Thrawn into the unknown regions in the first place.\n\nNew canon, however, makes everything you just said valid.
It's like claiming that the USMC promotes Satan worship and fascism because they embraced the 'Devil Dog' nickname handed to them by the Germans.
Soylent Green IS PEOPLE!
Yes
Not to mention that the destruction of the Death Star probably would have resulted in [genocide for the Ewoks](http://www.theforce.net/swtc/holocaust.html).
Yup, everyone knows Stormtroopers were Klingon. ;-)
Ignorance? In the left? Nawwww
Of course. But we cant forget that the Empire spent huge amounts of public credits building two Death Stars to subjugate it's own citizens through fear and to allow them to commit mass genocide in seconds. Terrorism is only terrorism when it's used against/with disregard for the lives of the population (e.g. Saw Guerrera). Otherwise it's just guerrilla warfare, which is natural to smaller/less prepared/poorly equipped rebellions.
Nah, Psychlos is where its at. Fuck, now I just reminded myself of that 2 hours of my life wasted.
Or the death stars were built as a deterrent against terrorism.  Alot of the planets in the alliance we outside of the empire.  The core planets prospered under Emperor Palpatine.  
Yeah, I heard in Episode VIII, they're replaced with slightly disgruntled teddy bears too.
So what you're saying is, his overconfidence was his weakness?
Ewoks. Are. Not. Teddy. Bears. 
What's with the "alleged?"\n\nThe empire was blatantly obviously full of space nazis. They even had race based purging.\n\nNo need to obscure the basis of the characters. This is ridiculous all on its own without intervention.
Umm. Stormtroopers were space nazis... this is pretty obvious?
I think it's more than alleged Nazi association. George drew a lot of inspiration directly from Nazi germany and most of the weapons in the films are chopped up Nazi weapons. The rebels are even armed with STG44s. Funnily though, the storm troopers are armed with modified British Sten guns. 
I'm usually offended that they are so bad at aiming their weapons.  
Must not have been History majors

Well, they blew up the Death Star, which was home to tens of thousands of workers and soldiers who were just doing their jobs. One could certainly make the argument that the rebels are terrorists. The Empire destroyed whole planets, though, so they aren't exactly good guys either. 
Stormtroopers march several times everyday at Disney Hollywood Studios.  A couple of them mingle among the guests searching for rebels.  I wonder how they would react there.

That's not really a good comparison as the Imperials were basically supposed to be space Nazis.
/r/EmpireDidNothingWrong/
They're surely to side with the Empire, and for pure stupidity. The Stormcloaks are barely racist when you know the oyher races in the Elder Scrolls universe. Merkind (the elves) has been the most oppressive force in Tamriel, and the Nords are particularly hateful towards the races that have preyed upon them for millenia.\n\nI could spend the entire day talking about how elves have fucked up mankind in many ways, from actual religious lore (there was a war between gods where man and mer took opposite sides), through the Ayleids enslaving the Cyrodillic human population, to the Thalmor seeking to destroy a man-turned-god and to eliminate mankind from the very pattern of possibility so that mortality never falls unto the elves again.\n\nThat said, considering the left's disregard for religion, and their hypocrisy of attacking a democratic society as oppressive while defending dictatorships, they're Empire through and through...
What, like the ones at the end of Episode VI?
Kinda sad no one else noticed

I'm looking forward to it. I always wanted some Fifth Doctor and Teagan only stories set during the minute in Frontios where he and Teagan take the Gravis to Kolkokron. It would be a great opportunity to actually create/fill in Teagan's character arc that pays off with her departure in Resurrection of the Daleks. This probably won't be that, but a man can dream.\n\nInteresting that Peter is getting the anthology release again this year instead of Sylvester or Colin.
So, nothing involving THX 1138 or American Graffiti? Just Star Wars? Star Wars wasn't Lucas' first film you know.
WO-O-AH
I was just about to suggest that they cut themselves to see if oil comes out.
How many big campaign promises did Obama make that didn't come true? At least give the man his first hundred days. A lot of rhetoric gets said on the campaign trail that turns out to not be the case.
Agents of Shield has been killing it this season. So if you can't wait...

Well good for the GOP. As for Trump, didn't you see how much he went back and forth on the campaign trail? He was against Obamacare one day, and then for it the day after. We just don't know what all of his positions are because either a) the media misportrays them or b) he makes it up as he goes along. Based on his inaugural speech yesterday, I could clearly tell that he is a liberal at heart though. The things he was saying about closing markets and curbing free trade are things I would expect to hear out of the mouth of Bernie Sanders.
You liar. Tom Baker is the best Doctor. In other news, water is wet, the sky is blue, dogs bark, and cats sleep all day.
Considering the quality of the Flash versus the other DC shows, I second this motion.

Not a game. Just pointing out that if the left were to wait a bit, they would see that Trump is their silver boy (though not golden boy since he does have a few right wing positions).

Sorry for the late comment.\n\nIf you want a dark story, I recommend the Project trilogy. Project Twilight has disemboweled cats, a man exploding into gory chunks, and a government conspiracy. I can't talk about the darkness in Project Lazarus without spoiling it, but I heavily recommend it. Project Destiny features a Flood like contagion infecting all of London (along with wrapping up the previous two stories). Take note however, there is a significant time jump between each story.
The Switch seems to me to be a system designed for young people between 24-30 who are settling down and having kids. It's designed so that a 30-year-old can get it to play games with their little kids.

Going just by the trailers, there is no dialogue wheel or decision making in this game. What used to be the series' main mechanic has been put to the side in favor of being a dumb, third-rate shooter.
Kinda sad that the episode ignored Lucas' other film contributions, his love for avant-garde films, and his love for racing. THX 1138 was on Lucas' mind in film school, not Star Wars.
Well, that was subpar. Why not appeal to his reasons for going to film school in the first place?
HAIL HYDRA!
The first series is good if you want some closure after The Blue Forgotten Planet. I would recomend it for that reason. You can listen to it for free on Spotify (assuming you are willing to listen to ads halfway through and between stories though).
NO!
He's a robit!
So they did show it once. Good to know. My point about how it is no longer the central mechanic as far as marketing is concerned still stands.
It's only been a little more than 24 hours and everyone's acting like he's the The antichrist incarnate. The man's in New York liberal. Aside from the repealing of Obamacare, he's going to support a lot of liberal policies.
I would buy a Switch if Prime 4 was announced for it. It could be the most disappointing thing since the Phantom Menace and I would still buy it.

When you compare the amount of bankruptcies Trump has had to the amount of businesses he has started, the ratio of failure to success significantly diminishes. As a multimillionaire who starts new ventures all the time, it is only natural that he would have a few failures.
That seems a little hyperbolic. James Buchanan it was the worst president ever. The pulling of the president is not dictated by what he's done in the past, but by what he does in office. Pray tell if this is actually what the left thinks, then what do you plan to accomplish with this protest? Trump will still be in office for the next four years anyway. Why not wait until 2020?
No, you are flaunting your opinion as fact. James Buchanan let the Union dissolve while he was in office, something that had never happened before or since. When things get to the point where half the country tries to leave and make a new nation-state, then you may have something. Please, let us forgo hyperbole and discuss things as they are and not as we imagine them to be.

Yes but mitt used it in mass. Cuz he wanted to make it work when he ran for president but he did admit in 2012 it didn't work.
Naw. As much as I think its a mental dissorder I still don't think we should be mean to him.\n\n
Yeah but did he vote trump after bush was done?
Why do people always bring up Obama's race?  He was just as much a white guy as black.
It's common knowledge that Rickey would stop at 3rd or second to steal bases.
What's worse I think is how they still dispute bill having been impeached act like it's gonna remove trump from office.  Impeach him, it's not tonne mean he's removed\n

Maybe he just wants off time? Ever think about that? Not much family time from mid Feb till Nov.\n\nMaybe he doesn't give two suits about obama or trump and wants to hang with his family.
The way his mind works is that he thinks it's mean to deny someone something simple.  Logically is absurd to think a male can be a female, the body human animal doesn't work like that but in liberals minds it's about being nice to people.\n\nThat's why he called trump, who said Jenner can use the woman's bathroom in his hotels, a monster.
He is flat out the best orator president we have had.  I'll admit he's better than reagan in That way.  He can start a rally over nothing and make it sound good.\n\nI can't stand obama but when he talks I sana buy what he's selling but when I read what he said I see its crap.  Lots of Americans only listen to him.  
I've lost hope in some people.
But we can be far right conservatives right?
If you feel some views are not deserving then I can very easily say your question is not deserving of respect and not answer 'cuz, according to your rules I don't have to.\n\nLike I said all views despite your opinion other peoples come from a legitimate place and are valid to that person, it's not your place to invalidate their ideas. Its your place to understand and convince them to your ideas.\n\nIf you atomatically decide a person's opinions are wrong all your gonna do is start a fight with them and hurt your own (valid) ideas.  This is why talking about political crap becomes hostile.
And just like that. I'm gay now.
It's so easy and acceptable for celebrities to be liberals that in my opinion the ones who don't let there views know are at least un-cucked, and may be based.
I read hitler loved his mom and liked dogs, guess I'm litterally hitler too guys.
No it wasn't. The whole pilgrim immigant thing is a myth it was founded to be a British farm land for money. Tobaccoo money

His mother in laws having surgery. Supposedly jake didntneven vote 
So your intolerant ok.
Nope. He's litteraly hitler (he's not)
But they can keep saying anti white stuff
Really?   Did this start when obama ended the wet foot dry foot policy?  Sending Cubans back.
That's called intolerance. Thinking an opinion isn't valid cuz you don't like it.
By the time they file it and get a court date the ban will be over.
Trump and cubs. Nice!!!
The people who are My friends are people who can talk about politics like adults, most aren't trump supporters but to be my friend you have to be like me, willing to listen and be respectful.\n\nIn terms of work it's the same thing.  If they can't it tell them to fuck off.\n\nYour opinions are just as valid don't let mlb mentality scare you.

Honestly they should jail her. If only for 30 days just to make the point you can't incite violence as part of the first amendment.  She clearly was trying to start some shit and should be made an example out of.
If you live in America you are not a communist.  Capitalsim allows you to pretend you are.\n\nIn simplist terms communism doesn't work cuz people are greedy.  No money no products.  Communism cant work on a large scale.  Communism only works in small farm like villages where everyone is already o. Equal ground.
Ohhhh. Well played Mr Carson well played sir.\n\nGovernment assistance isn't a job.
Part (g) of the order states that homeland security can make case by case by dissitions on entry.\n\nI will admit that the current administration was too quick with this order and should have considered them but green card holders we never explicitly banned.  Nor anyone truly if you read section (g) its just extreme veting like trump said he was gonna do.
So your rather let anyone walk into America?  How do you feel about having your home open to all?  Or so you want to make sure who enters is ok first?
That still doesn't make sense.  Oh well her loss if she can't explain it.
I don't have a problem with bill nye I have only the problem with those who think he's a real scientist.  Bills a smart guy and can have an opinion. But it's those who champion him as some one of legit credentials that are the real problem.\n\nIf I want to know how the landing gear on a 707 works bill nye is my Go to guy, climate change, abortion he's just a guy with on opinion.
And just like that I'm gay.
Doesn't mean your views are valid then.
They are expensive bro. Just stick with the shoes.
Democrats don't have enough seats to say no......
I know, but today's world is what it is.  I got a buddy who's on his phone at games all the time, so much so I've asked if he's keeping score on it.

Who decides what proper training is?  Who decides who's crazy?\n\nThe problem is not guns, it's glorification of violence in our culture that causes improper gun use.  Stp glorifying guns and the problems will stop.\n\nVideo games, tv , movies....
To be objective here. Most presidents wait till they have their AG in place before making such orders.\n\nI get why trump did it so fast, he wants people to see he's a do'er but had he waited till sessions got in nobody would have cared.
If wonder if this dude realizes he did not describe racism but race privilege.\n\nThey do t even know their arguments.
So your saying this was done to spite the fact that Cubans hate socialism?
I want Ron Santo and Billy Williams.
There's a lot of guys who cheated by forming bats, doctoring balls some in the HoF.  Corking a at doesn't do much actually, it gives you like 5-15 ft.  Sosa wasn't hitting basket home runs at wrigley.

"Racist" to liberals means "poopy head".  They have no better way to disagree with him, 'coz they never learned how to formulate independent toughts.\n\nAnd it's cuz the schools and parents don't teach them.

So you think its ok for the mother to murder her kid?\n\nWhat point is it ok? 
Was it?  How many people actually considered the court when voting obama?  
Now that he won. Where does the money go?\n
Ok but how do you keep the crazy from killing?
Liberals think differently. They want to help people but don't know how, so they seek the government to help.\n\nSo.....with open borders remind them that more secure borders will help minorities, legal immigrants and poor people.\n\nIt will help cuz now the guy who came from Mexico legally won't have to compete with the illegal who's working for less under the table.
Yeah but the anti gun people in America think the millitary and police are going to protect them.\n\nI agree how ironic of obama but we gotta get a better argument to stop gun control.
It was a good call by the gop, let the people decide.
But they have comitted acts of terror. So best to be proactive.
It's on a be weird to him when that marine salutes trump next weekend. His mind might explode.
With regards to your first chart, I saw a response in another thread that basically sums up a lot of my thoughts on that comparison... all credit to u/lordderplythethird:\n\n>I disagree with the spending increase, but $ to $ amount is just straight ignorant. Russian military has the same numbers as the US military, and the US military spends more on personnel alone than Russia does for the entire military.\n\n>Cost of living is not the same across the globe. A dollar goes far further in Russia, China, India, Brazil, etc than it does in the US, so personnel in all those countries get paid nothing compared to their US counterparts.\n\n>For instance, a Russian private makes $400 a month. A Chinese private makes just $100 a month. A US private however, makes $1500 a month. Apply that to 1,000,000 or so troops, and see how radically different military expenditures are. Now apply it to the people building the tanks/jets/etc in each of those nations. Watch the military expenditures change even more.\n\n>$ to $ is probably the single worst way to compare militaries
In this context, essentially.\n\nAnother context would be in the case of you're married and if your spouse was staying extra late at work and is acting generally suspicious, you could also apply the saying to that situation.\n\nIn this case, I think they're basically saying "This doesn't seem right, so I'm going to ignore it." But you can apply the saying to a lot of things
My issue isn't with Bannon being on the Council. It's Bannon (a political figure) being put on the Council and the removing the heads of our military and intelligence entities. Politicization of a body whose sole responsibility is national security should be concerning to everyone.\n\nAll of this is just aggravated by the existence of the Disposition Matrix (kill authorizations of US citizens, provided by the NSC), and moving it further from our military/intelligence apparatus and further into the hands of politicians can never be a good thing.
You're not misremembering, from what I remember, if we're still using Israel as our context, it'd be like a modern-day Palestinian put in this scenario.
>That's why people are turning away from you.\n\nAnd who exactly is "you" in this context? I'm assuming you mean "libruls?"...
Also worth pointing out we had a sizable fight literally yesterday. Content (by which I mean PL, of course) comes to us.
No.
His secret plan to defeat isis is the same as his plan to defeat crime, namely: "Defeat it better"
Could just have used one of the heart-attack guns that people on r/conspiracy occasionally rant about.
Serious question. How likely is this to be overturned of SCOTUS decides to take it? Just based on how the justices typically vote. Does this change if the new guy magically makes it on before the case is theoretically heard?\n\nEdit: Thank you all so much for the responses! Consider me reassured that checks and balances will when the day.
Just reminded me of A Series of Unfortunate Events, where the author essentially begs the reader to stop reading in the intro of every book in the series. (Also, just finished the Netflix series, and it's really great)
>The President ... shall have Power to Grant Reprieves and Pardons for Offenses against the United States, **except in Cases of Impeachment**.\n\nIf you impeach the guy, problem solved.
> cry to the liberal courts about some nonsense \n\nAnyone who knows anything about politics knows that gerrymandering is not "nonsense", it's a real problem that both parties take advantage of when they're in power. I can get behind any attempt to remove partisanship from drawing districts, regardless of who sponsors it.
> targets people for murder\n\nA power that Bannon has now that he's on the National Security Council.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_National_Security_Council#Kill_authorizations
So just ten minutes from literally any of his speeches then?
I think you've misunderstood, I'm just trying to explain the saying to someone who apparently never heard it before, I'm not agreeing with the original viewpoint that 'it doesn't pass the sniff test'.
Hate him or not, you've got to give him credit for being the one guy on earth to use "bequeathed" in a sentence that doesn't take place during a scrabble game.
If you look at the video released by the White House, you can see everyone in the room standing and applauding. After 30 seconds or so, some people have started to sit, but the vast majority of people are still standing and applauding.\n\nIt's also worth pointing out that the photo at the top of this article was from 30 minutes before this part of the speech came up.
You must have missed the rebranding... now they "stood up for their values" for 6 years and Dems are obstructing, *entirely* different things.
Or, time travel is possible, but travelling back to stop Trump would cause time travel to not be invented, thus you can never travel back in time to stop him.
It's literally built into the Constitution, that's as silly as saying that Trump's illegitimate solely because he won the electoral vote. It's the system we have, stop saying it's not valid because you don't like it.
There's sources saying that DHS wrote up the order to initially include language that exempted green-card and visa holders, but Bannon had it removed. \n\nWe can't know for sure, but just tossing that out there as food for thought.
Always undock, and never don't take bait.
You do remember Congress can lower salaries for individuals to $1?

It's a "BING" board... yet another attempt by Microsoft to push their awful search engine.
I don't get your logic here... There is a dossier that says that events A - Z happened, it's dismissed as fake news. We now confirm A,B,D,E,Q,S and T did in fact happen and are still looking into the rest. Why doesn't that earn the rest of the report some amount of credibility?
Ok, well, I'm a Republican, so the failures of the DNC have been evident for a while.
I don't think so. Additionally, Evil VIP's can sometimes provide free Resistance Contacts if captured alive (for some reason).
And I'm one of the few people on the starboard side slapping people  to try to get them to realize, or even just pay attention to, what's going on.
You need to understand the difference between opinion pieces and actual news. Don't make the mistake a lot on the left make in having Hannity/O'Reilly be an example of the right peddling speculation/fake news. They are opinion shows, same as most of the inflammatory articles.
Correct. Only 500+ can save you now.
From what I've seen of Milo, he enjoys provoking people, so I'm about 99% sure that the scholarship isn't out of actual racism, more out of trying to goad people into giving him more attention... which seems to be working.
> you are highly unlikely to have 20 guys chilling in the Avenger because they're all off infiltrating.\n\nIt all varies, my second campaign so far has consisted almost exclusively of rescue missions, so I got half a dozen engi's and scientists within 2-3 months, as well as another 6-8 rookies + a shit ton of resistance members.\n\nI have two squads worth of geared up guys on the Avenger basically lounging around while my half dozen shinobi/specialist teams are out infiltrating, since, other than liberation missions, and one supply raid, I haven't had anything requiring their services.
Also, that they viewed the government as having failed to prove two of the four criteria needed to lift the stay on the ban.
I think that even when I was peak Niceguy^TM back in high school, I would have cringed at this.
Well then he'll need to throw in a /s, because too many people take this shit seriously, so I treat it as serious unless otherwise noted.
Reason #1 a nuclear war isn't happening: In all likelihood, we've got a couple Ohio's sitting off the coast of China with something like a couple hundred nukes between 'em that could retaliate before China's missiles hit the ground.
Hate to break it to you, but "debunking" means doesn't work like this:\n\nPerson A accuses B of C.\n\nB denies C.\n\nC is debunked. QED.
Every time I see one of these stupid pie charts, I'm always sure [this](http://i.imgur.com/BChmAy4.jpg) is more accurate.
You would think, she's made public a lot of weird stances on things. For instance, her rant about soccer a couple years ago, where her reasons for hating soccer are:\n\nLack of individual achievement - anyone who's played soccer knows this is bs.\n\n>No serious sport is co-ed\n\nSure. Also, this is apparently why "liberal moms" like soccer.\n\nScoreless ties - not unheard of in sport like hockey, which she praises due to reasons that will become clear.\n\n>The prospect of either personal humiliation or major injury is required to count as a sport.\n\nWhich eliminates a good 60% or so of Olympic sports, but ok, we'll go with her arbitrary metric of what is and isn't a sport.\n\n>You can't use your hands in soccer.\n\nI mean, sure, I guess that's a reason to not like it.\n\n>I resent the force-fed aspect of soccer. The same people trying to push soccer on Americans are the ones demanding that we love HBO's "Girls," light-rail, Beyonce and Hillary Clinton. The number of New York Times articles claiming soccer is "catching on" is exceeded only by the ones pretending women's basketball is fascinating. \n\n*heavy sigh*\n\n> It's foreign.\n\nNo... just no.\n\n>Soccer is like the metric system, which liberals also adore because it's European.\n\nSee above.\n\n>Soccer is not "catching on."\n\nI mean, not to the extent of other sports, but it's not too shabby.\n\nAnd finally, as the conclusion to this whole thing:\n\n>\nIf more "Americans" are watching soccer today, it's only because of the demographic switch effected by Teddy Kennedy's 1965 immigration law. I promise you: No American whose great-grandfather was born here is watching soccer. One can only hope that, in addition to learning English, these new Americans will drop their soccer fetish with time. \n\nEven ignoring the quote I originally mentioned, the fact that she apparently bases her likes/dislikes on whether liberals like it or whether it's foreign/European is concerning all on its own.\n\nSource: http://www.anncoulter.com/columns/2014-06-25.html
But shouldn't we at least critically examine the changes he's making? I'm all for an elected person finally following up on some of their promises, but "change Washington" could mean a million things, not all of them good.\n\nI'm not basing my opinions off of the MSM, rather mainly on what friends/co-workers of mine (I work in infosec, so you've got a lot of ex-govt people working in that sector) are saying. And they are fairly concerned over the changes made to the NSC. He's making it more political, at the expense of military and intelligence leadership.
That's how you win people to your side!
> not every decision or issue necessitates military or intelligence inputs.\n\nThat's true, as far as I'm aware though, during the Bush and Obama admins, the CJCS and DNI just wouldn't show up to meetings that had nothing to do with their areas of expertise, but it was their choice, not someone else's. I've just never been a fan of politicians determining stuff like this because it always gets twisted into what's good politics, not what's good for the country or national security
>literal email evidence and photographs.\n\nDon't get me started... I'm all for a good conspiracy, but what you have is a made up code language and some photos that prove nothing. Treating it as fact when all you have is a massive load of speculation is incredibly silly.\n\nAlso, even if it was true, it would still be considered a conspiracy, in fact, charges would even include the word conspiracy in it... thus my adding bullshit to the end.\n\n>No, by doing literally what he said he was going to do come hell or high water.\n\nBut what happens when that comes in conflict with checks and balances?\n\n>Trump didn't back down when faced with corporate interests against him.\n\nAnd I could give him credit for that during the election, but he immediately caved to Goldman-Sachs and Co. once he was actually in office.
> They also are afraid of things like stairs.\n\nWell, it's perfectly reasonable to be afraid of stairs without risers.
Making a stock trading algorithm in Piet = worse than death.
I mean, on one hand, he didn't scream FEEEEMALES!!!!1! \n\nOn the other, he replaced it with "your kind" which is almost worse.
It is worth pointing out that they both got some facts wrong.\n\nCruz said 6 million people lost health insurance following Obamacare, most estimations put the number at about 2.5 million or so, give or take a couple hundred thousand. It's still bad, but the 6 mil number was based on flawed preliminary information. [Source 1](http://www.rand.org/content/dam/rand/pubs/research_reports/RR600/RR656/RAND_RR656.pdf), [Source 2](http://healthaffairs.org/blog/2014/03/03/how-many-nongroup-policies-were-canceled-estimates-from-december-2013/). Another reason the 6 million number is so contested is because the closest official estimate for that was closer to 4.5 million, released by the AP, but no supporting methodology or other information was released.\n\nSanders brought up the whole "tens of thousands will die" argument, but it's been endlessly brought up that correlation does not mean causation.\n\nCruz mentioned a spike in part-time employment to dodge the employer health care requirement, but according the the BLS, both full-time and part-time employment have nearly adjusted back to pre-recession levels. [Source](http://www.businessinsider.com/part-time-vs-full-time-employment-2013-7)\n\nSanders mentioned the amount of spending per capita by the US is more than twice of any other country, when really it's closer to 1.2x the spending. Still bad, but again, exaggerations help no one. [Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_total_health_expenditure_per_capita)\n\nAnd there's a few more examples, but I don't remember them off the top of my head. Just wanted to post this as a reminder to follow up on statistics said during live debates. Moderators don't do live fact checking, so we shouldn't Cruz or Sanders at their word just because we may like one or the other, or the picture that their provided statistics paint.
Hasn't that been the MO the past few months or so for Trump and his staff? They say something, and then later deny, then people point at the denials and say "I guess we'll never know"... 
I mean, to be fair, in this particular issue, it's fairly consistent with that ideal, leaving it up to the states instead of the feds.\n\nI'm not saying that means they're right, just that it's consistent.
CONGRATULATIONS ON YOUR MS
I'm unsure whether this is a joke, bad phrasing or a legit question, so I'll answer it as though it's legit.\n\nMaking the DNI and CJCS non-permanent attendees to NSC meetings is dangerous. In the past, the DNI/CJCS would skip out on meetings where their experience was unneeded, but forcing the heads of the DNI and CJCS to get authorization to attend these meetings threatens the situational awareness that the executive branch has tried to maintain since 9/11, since one of the major issues behind it was lack of communication between agencies.
How much does it change things though? We all sin. It's impossible for us not to sin, /u/MusicOfTheAinur just has one more thing to add to the insurmountable pile.
Well, I find that perfectly socially acceptable.
> The messenger is irrelevant, let's focus on the information...\n\nSays the people who only want to focus on how leaks occurred, not what leaks have actually revealed. That's called hypocrisy, FYI. 
You are aware that Trump posted a fake news story in the last day or so that was supposed to have justified his ban because Kuwait did it first... and it turns out they don't? \n\nHe later took down the link, but don't you find it concerning that anyone criticizing him is attacked as 'fake news' while legitimately false news is promoted by him because it fits his agenda?
That's President Grim "Bannon" Reaper to you!
If you're barely turning a profit, and you suddenly have a huge expense, it either means firings, or not insignificant price increases.
Again, not saying it's ok, just that it's probably not racism for the sake of racism... I disagree with him on everything I can think of, but he seems very much like he's trying to be Trump in the attention-seeking dept.
Yeah, well I remember "How Do You Like Me Now" being played in 2012
Also, before the election, there were a couple pedo rings the feds busted with dozens of people involved... so it's not like these things just slip by.
I mean, that's great and all... but why do we care what Rowling thinks? Why is this on the front of /r/politics?
No... people on the left throw around the "literally Hitler" thing a lot, but ignoring checks and balances is exactly the sort of thing that would justify that narrative.\n\nPOTUS does not have unlimited power, the judiciary is there to keep them from doing anything unlawful.
>He made promises regarding this, got voted for them, and is carrying them out.\n\nI'll give you this, it doesn't mean all his ideas are automatically the right ones though...\n\n~~>two~~\n\n~~to~~\n\n>parading ~~two~~ to corporate interests around that promise change you can believe in, and literally deliver the same crap for 8 years.\n\nAnd you think an admin who's appointed oil/banking execs to critical departments is going to lead to real change in said departments?\n\n>spirit cooking\n\nGTFO with this conspiracy bs.\n\n>he was doing things as democracy SHOULD work.\n\nBy questioning the judiciary and acting like he should be able to do whatever the hell he wants, regardless of checks/balances?\n\n>This is a far better precendent than talking shit\n\nYou have listened to or seen words he's spoken/written at some point during his existence right? This is the definition of his speech.\n\nEdit: Phrasing threw off my English game.
> annexing\n\n
I'm assuming something similar to the "something smells fishy about this" phrase.
As far as I understand it, the ruling just reaffirms that the states can still challenge the govt. on immigration, regardless of whether National Security is thrown around as an excuse.
The funny thing is, the typical excuse I'm seeing boils down to "those outlets said mean things about Trump" causing me to sigh as I remember all the FB spam about stuff Hillary has supposedly done vs Trump's "saying mean things"...\n\nThe hypocrisy is hilarious and horrifying.
I honestly think it's a psychological thing. Christians know that they're flawed and sinful based on their principles, so they find some person or group of people that they *know* is worse than them (in their eyes), and can tell themselves "at least I'm not that screwed up" and then go on doing whatever sinful stuff they were doing before. \n\nThat thing may be homosexuality, or sleeping around, or whatever, but regardless, they use it as justification for their own behavior, or if not justification, a way to feel better about their own behavior.
Dammit, and for the first two slides I was actually enjoying all the puns, but he had to go and ruin it.
>I’ve never understood the argument ‘we’re going to war for oil.’ We need oil. Why shouldn’t we go to war for oil, we need it…drop a nuke, daisy cutter, it doesn’t matter.\n\nSorry, not trusting someone who has that sort of reasoning.\n\n
Also, the fact is, he hasn't been brought back yet. Even if he was right, until he was actually handed him over, this wouldn't mean shit.
Plus, lore-wise, it would make more sense that outside of bases, retaliations and maybe supply raids, you'll have far more normal troopers (or their variants/commanders) keeping order among the general populace, rather than dozens of sneks apparently guarding every single prisoner ADVENT keeps.
Rasmussen isn't exactly the worst out there, but they aren't always accurate, for instance, across more than 600 polls, they have an average bias of +2 for Republicans. and have called 80% of races correctly.\n\nPew is better bias-wise (+0.6 D) but worse race-calling wise (57%)
You can still be convicted for those crimes, impeachment refers to the political process of removing the guy from office for those crimes.
Psychedelic Saturdays!
Ah, ok. Thank you! Must have missed that.
>everything he is doing\n\nIncluding the changes to the NSC? I've yet to run into someone who will defend this, and am curious to hear the rationale behind it.
I've actually seen a modern version of the "loose lips sink ships" poster on a tour through a govt. building before...
>Gerrymander has been a part of American politics from the beginning.\n\nAnd? Corruption has always been a part of politics, should we not make any effort to stop that?\n\nLook up the shortest splitline method. It could completely eliminate partisan gerrymandering by making it so that literally anybody could verify and agree that mathematically the results are fair and correct... problem solved.
I can see Bannon being on the council, and if that was it, I wouldn't have any issues with it, but having the potential of cutting out the heads of military/intelligence is the troubling part to me.
And realistically, any of the justices with spouses probably hear that person's opinion on anything remotely controversial, they just aren't as public about it as Mrs. Thomas

It's [this guy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keith_Kellogg) btw. I don't know enough about him to make a judgement yet.
From what I've heard, almost everyone from both sides of the aisle criticized this guy for that... it's entirely uncalled for, and I'm glad people aren't putting up with it from this guy.
I'll hold you to that.
I actually liked both of them. I disagree on parts of the solutions that both propose to the problems facing the country, but they're both able to agree (generally) on what the issues are. This is the sort of debate we needed in the presidential debates, rather than... whatever it is we got.
Lore-wise, I think that it would likely be due to intel the lone Councilman is feeding the Resistance. He may not know the details, but if he was fairly high up in the human admin, he'd know something was up.
Hans Gruber
And really, they weren't ruling on the Constitutionality of the order, they based their ruling on well-established criteria that the Government needed to fulfill to get the ban resumed, and it failed two of the four, thus they didn't reinstate it. Constitutionality only plays into one of the points, and they didn't make a definitive statement on it I believe.
Eh, at least with a sub you have the excuse of not being able to look out the window and see shit.
I didn't realize Elliott Belgrave was a nation.
So, I guess McConnell never heard of the Streisand Effect?

Let's say they're picked up on an ICE raid on a business.
There are some things the states shouldn't be able to decide. I think we had a war over it.

Patrolling neighborhoods with loaded weapons. Isn't that open carry? People patrol tea party events with loaded guns all the time. It was a tremendously anti-2nd amendment law.\n\nAnd the NRA came out with a very wishy washy defense of Philando Castile's right to carry in the days after it made the news. The NRA would rather ignore a man's second amendment rights being infringed than criticize the police.
Illegals cost the country a lot of money. Deporting them helps pay for itself.

How can you say this wasn't an attack on the second amendment, and a racist one as well.\n\nConstitutionalists should never forget this piss Reagan took on the Constitution.
That's what makes console play better. People won't ruin your team's morale before the game is lost by constantly whining.\n\n

China and Russia both have many human rights violations. But since Trump wants to enforce immigration laws we don't deserve the olympics. Pathetic.

This is concerning someone in custody that is ready to be deported but they don't want to tell us from which country south of the border they're from. What should we do with them then? Do what Australia does and keep them in camps until they tell us where they are from?
I didn't say it will completely pay for itself. But even this website says they cost billions a years, so does that not help pay for the cost of deportation?
It's just kinda amusing that everyone from Sweden were rushing to say there's absolutely no consequences to their huge amounts of migrants. And then something like this happens.

It certainly would help if the left stopped acting like there are no consequences to huge amounts of third world migrants. It only emboldens people that think "the left just does not want to see reality". 
Weren't so many crappy drivers that learned  how to drive in the third world either. 
States that have recreational marijuana have less opioid overdoses also. Dumb move.

Where was the NRA protecting the right to carry in his honor?

The freedom of the press to do what? Do the press have the freedom to have a room in the White House just for them? Trump isn't stopping them from writing what they want, he just didn't invite them to his event. I don't think it's a good look, but this doesn't censor them at all.

Not applicable here. The government is the one backing these loans, and it is nigh impossible for a borrower to discharge the debt via bankruptcy, unlike a mortgage. And if someone does get rid of the debt, it's the taxpayers on the hook (usually), not a company.
Flynn might be smart, but McMaster is the smartest general out there. Extremely well read. Insightful. Impeccable in integrity. Respected by all ranks. Trump literally could not have made a better pick.

Reminds me of a Soviet joke: The American and the Soviet constitutions both protect freedom of speech. The difference is the American constitution protects you after the speech too.
Was being ultra-specific. Just like the specific manifestations of fascism differ in their culture and time, so do the manifestations of "right wing" politics. More generally, would define right wing as the part of the political spectrum that is focused on individual rights, hostile to legal positivism, and embraces subsidiarity.
So . . .\n>Your last argument is patently ridiculous\n\n>Claiming that there is an exact definition of fascism . . . is stupid\n\nDon't really know what I was expecting here.\n\nAnyway.\n>See the spectrum changes over time not just in terms of the number of people, but also in terms of what we consider to be rights and responsibilities.\n\nAnd I am saying it doesn't. I **am** taking the long view, looking through Roman law, Justinian, and English and then American common law to see how things are defined. Especially when you compare the arguments against powerful concentrated government and in favor of individual rights today versus those same arguments made in the late 1700s, things tend to stay pretty consistent.\n\n>you are already redefining fascism from what it originally meant in order to use it to refer to a general ideology rather than the actual fascists.\n\nYes. I am. Fascism *is* an ideology, which entails both objectives and means. Common threads in fascist movements: glorification of "the people," otherization of enemies of the state/people such as banks (really whoever is opposed to the fascists), disregard for individual rights, expansion of a welfare state (which ties in with the previously-mentioned otherization, because "the welfare state would work but for those acting against it"), hostility to the freedom of the press, corporatism combined with a belief that corporations need to pay their "fair share," an affinity for military structures, a belief in the Nietzchean will to power, and so on. \n\nLeft wing figures who were advocating fascism: W. E. B. DuBois, Rexford Guy Tugwell, George Soule, George Bernard Shaw, Charles Beard, H. G. Wells (for a while), Samuel McClure, and so on.\n\nAll of this is in a conception of the political spectrum that contrasts classical liberalism with progressivism/social liberalism/Marxism that has remained fairly constant for centuries.\n\nEnd of the story, fascism actually **means** something. And what it means is certainly not something that can be called "right wing," which in the American context means a classical liberal who embraces the constitutional tradition.\n\nThe other bit is a tangent, but:\n>The requirement is that business owners who have businesses open to the public, do not infringe on the rights of others by refusing to do business with them or by refusing to hire them or by refusing to pay for their healthcare\n\nWhat rights are those? To have someone else provide them a service? If you have that right, where does it come from?

Going for the boss was a bad choice, but they still dominated because they finally got assertive 
Yes. Many, if not most, states with voter ID laws offer them free of charge. Still are opposed, because "racist."
Conservatives don't believe in a free for all. Markets require a level of regulation, and after often enhanced by them (for example, to create transparency or protect trademarks). However, the left tends to go too far in one direction when balancing the interests of the economy and the environment, and often in ways that are not firmly justified by science.
Obviously it's not a First Amendment issue. It is an issue when a public (not public in the governmental sense) media platform that claims to exist for the free and open exchange of ideas continually takes action to shut down the ideas they don't agree with. This isn't an issue of constitutional rights, but instead how we function as a civil society.
Which historically is why fascists were called right wing. Stalin needed to marginalize those who were less left wing then him, and so he called them right wing. And it stuck, because leftist historians can more easily fit the atrocities of fascist regimes into their narrative if fascists are called right wing.
On the one hand I think the State Department needs to get cleaned out. On the other, I think you don't want to fire someone everytime they disagree, or you get an administration of yes men.

Okay, I see a lot of comments here getting into semantics, and a lot of people parroting the bias they have been imbued with due to false history that is commonly taught. But no one here is making an actual historical argument. If you do that, you'll see that fascism is a left wing movement. Another commenter linked Jonah Goldberg's book Liberal Fascism, and that's a good place to start. Modern fascism was first expressed in the French Revolution, but for our purposes it's good to look at progressive thought of about a century ago. See how it was expressed by Wilson, Theodore Roosevelt, John Dewey, and Herbert Croly. Look at the ideas they expressed, and the similarities they had with the burgeoning fascist movements in Europe (and often open admiration). Look at how those same ideas were expressed in, say, the statements of Franco, or the party platform of the NSDAP. It's important to understand that at that time there were very few who were advocating for a view of liberty based on the concept that rights are inherent to the person, not granted by government. Collective action was the motif of the day, with a few others like Alfred Nock. Hell, Churchill was banned in the BBC. Anyway, what I'm trying to say is that there is a historical record far too large to adequately capture in a reddit comment, but that people should examine it, and if they do they'll see how fascism is an manifestation of authoritarian socialism, with the particulars (racial hatred, affinity with a particular religion, etc) merely an expression of the time and culture in which fascism arrives.
Not only this, but you're pulling that 1% number out of nowhere. Check out the actual surveys that have been done in the UK of UK Muslims. The numbers will shock you. For example, more than half of British Muslims (52%) think homosexuality should not be legal, and nearly half (47%) think it is not appropriate for gay people to teach in schools. A bit more than 1% see political violence as legitimate.\r\rhttp://www.cnn.com/2016/04/11/europe/britain-muslims-survey/index.html\r

It does a few things, but only if you are dedicated to spreading creep everywhere. First off, the passive abilities that Nydus gives you are tremendous. You get more creep, which means you have a larger area with movement buff for engage and disengage. The other passive is absurdly strong. Getting battle momentum thrown in for free with the ult is a pretty good deal. Just make sure to do basic attacks as often as you can safely so you can spam your abilities.\r\rThe really big benefit, of course, is the Nydus itself. You should never need to hearth again once you hit 10. You can push extremely aggressively, using all your abilities on cool down, and then quickly jump into a Nydus to top off your mana. Put a Nydus near each lane and each camp. If you are pushing aggressively and see the enemy coping your direction, just drop a Nydus and go to the opposite side of the map. They never should be able to catch you. Having a Nydus also means that your will have vision in an area that doesn't expire, unlike creep. Having a Nydus near a bruiser camp means you can solo the camp and then quickly heal yourself so you can do other things. It means you can soak a couple extra waves and then get to the objective just in time. Essentially, you become a global character with 0 cool down on the global ability. In a game with more and more huge maps, that is a crazy advantage. Think about how you will never be missing XP from minion waves because of the time it takes to travel from the hearth to the lane. Also, it takes a lot of pressure off your healer so he can focus on the rest of your team. There's so much more too, but that's off the to of my head.\r\rUnfortunately, her abilities are just a bit too weak for me to play her right now.

The Nation of Islam "mosque" is on Lafayette Boulevard just a bit east of Tidewater Drive. The Nation of Islam is a *very* racist ideology.

Economics are closely tied to political spectrums. And "fascism is a right wing ideology" may be a common myth, but it is still a myth. Read, for example, Liberal Fascism by Jonah Goldberg. If you want primary sources, the platform of the Nazi party, Mein Kampf, or really any fascist materials related to capitalism will work.

Look at what he actually advocated for though. Those clashes were all among different flavors of leftists. At that time, there were very few in the world that could be called right wing. The thirties was a period of conflict among various schools of thought on the left portion of the spectrum.

Downvote away, but I'm right. Formatting jacked because mobile:\r\rMr. Ryan also defended Mr. Trump’s action as consistent with a previous House vote to put on hold a Syrian refugee program and a separate provision that Congress put into law in 2015 to impose new restrictions that ban certain groups from visa-free travel to the U.S.\r\rUnder that measure, people from 38 countries who normally would be allowed to travel to the U.S. without a visa would be required to get a visa if they had traveled to Iran, Iraq, Syria or Sudan in recent years, or if they had dual citizenship with one of those four countries. \r\rUntil Mr. Trump’s executive order, those dual citizens could still come into the country with a visa. The Obama administration later added three more countries to its list—Yemen, Somalia and Libya—for a total of seven; although it had excepted dual nationals of those three countries from the new restrictions. \r\r“These countries were named in legislation that we talked about last year,” Mr. Ryan said, pushing back on claims that Mr. Trump’s action amounted to a Muslim ban. “There is an issue with respect to terrorists trying to infiltrate our refugee population,” he said.\r\rThe administration has said the travel ban doesn’t represent a religious test, noting there are dozens of Muslim countries that aren’t affected. Critics have denounced it as targeting Islam because the seven countries—Iraq, Iran, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, Libya and Yemen—have majority populations of Muslims. The administration notes that the seven countries were initially identified by the Obama administration as posing significant security risks.\r\rhttps://www.wsj.com/articles/paul-ryan-defends-trumps-travel-ban-we-need-to-pause-1485882955

And I think that ties in with a fundamental inability on the left (for the most part) to understand the views of the right, while the right (for the most part) understands but disagrees with the views on the right. This comes from moral foundations theory, [expressed well by the (leftist) Jonathan Haidt](http://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/25/books/review/the-righteous-mind-by-jonathan-haidt.html?_r=1&ref=books).

They look so petty right now. They are DONE.
It is irrelevant whether Berkeley wants to support those views. They are a public entity, and are obligated under the First Amendment to allow speakers for a duly constituted student group.
But no one else
For example, drilling of the coast of Virginia or in ANWR is completely forbidden, with (IMO) weak justification. The EPA gets involved in local issues, which brings in federalism concerns. They have a ridiculously expansive view of what "navigable waters" means in the Clean Water Act. Fully half of California's water is diverted to save a single species of smelt, leading to water shortages and ruin for farmers in the interior of California. Absurd amounts of money get sunk into renewable sources of energy which are ineffective and themselves have significant environmental costs that are disregarded. And so on.
It's a pretty strong one. Another is the general idea that rights exist only as they are granted by government, rather than being inherent to simply being human.
No, as an employee of the executive branch, she was obliged to carry out lawful orders of the president, which this was.

No, it doesn't. You are conflating absolute and relative positions. By your thinking, Obama could be called right wing since he is to the right of Bernie Sanders. But we don't, because that's inane. Instead, we look at them on some fairly objective point on a spectrum. Sure, the spectrum was different in the thirties, but only insofar as how many people were at either end. That era was a nadir for the conception of individual rights though, especially in the past few hundred years of history, so it seems more reasonable to mark out a spectrum considering the thought of today and, say, the late 1700s than to define the spectrum solely by the thirties. It would be like saying March is a really warm month, but only being able to say that because you're only comparing it to winter months.\r\rAdditionally, you're making an ipse dixit argument for how we define fascism that is both inherently logically fallacious and also just wrong. Fascism is generally conceived of as a political movement with certain beliefs. See my top level comment in this post for some historical sources to validate that claim against.\r\rFinally, your characterization of the right as seen today (which is not that new historically, it's ideas just became unpopular for several decades) is similarly inaccurate. For example, we don't say that businesses have religious beliefs. We do recognize, however, that rights people have individually should not be restrained simply because they are acting in aggregate, and that asking a business owner to act against his religious beliefs is just as abhorrent as forcing a Quaker to fight a war.

I've been toying around with a shell similar to this.  Something I've also been toying around with is Four Steps.  Since all of your purple besides Magic Duel, EoM, and ROYAL CANTERLOT VOICE! require 2, you can run Four Steps instead of Blue Moon and have the same effective cost but with an upside ability.  I agree that Eff Stop should replace nest weavers.  I feel that BWYB is better than Magic Duel in this deck.  Another card to consider maybe instead of Fashion Week is Not on the List.  It kills everything but FlutterGUI and Eagle in BBZ.  Another bomby card that I like better than EoM would be Spring Forward.  It's more a contingency for when they do get a lot of friends to their problem.  I haven't played with Canterlot Archives and don't know how I feel about it.  It looks like a trap of a card, but I think it has potential.  In Your Dreams I feel is a fine card in this deck.\nThe problem deck seems to be too low required for your opponent.  Also, the effects don't really hinder your opponent.  I'm still a fan of the classic problem deck from taxes, but swapping the starting for Social Obligations or Ancient Research is a good swap.\nThese are my musings on the deck.  I really like what you started with and it looks fun.

I'm in the same boat at my LGS but we're not even on Enterplay's "where to buy" or "where to play" list.  We've gotten promos twice from them, but never again.  When the store championships were going on, we never got the promos  for that either.  Both the owner and I have tried contacting Enterplay about these issues, but they just kept responding that they sent the promos.  Nothing about the where to buy/play placement either.  Frankly, my store owner is getting frustrated with them.  And I feel her pain.  Sometimes I feel we're lucky to get packs in at all.  Honestly, I came to the game as a game lover first, then became a brony.  So with the lack of response from Enterplay, it's left me feeling disappointed at times that I tried to play something that wasn't mtg.\n\nI realize this sounds a lot like I'm bashing Enterplay, but I'm not.  I love everything they've released for this game.  But the serious lack of response to our store about organized play or even something as simple as where to buy/play is off-putting.
I thought about eff stop as well. But he has a similar issue to nest weaver. This deck is greedy and they're a little expensive. Coco would fit in pretty well though.

A group of Italians walk up to you. One of them in a cartoonist accent says "weeaboo you offa the stage!" And they go about their day.
This reminds me of one of my favorite archetypes in mtg; hug.  Almost every deck I play in EDH any more has some element of hug or silly gimmick to it.  I had been fiddling with an idea similar to this, but just never bothered to fill out a list.  This seems very fun, indeed!
As always, an entertaining read! It never fails that cici and flitter remind me of me and a friend when we're discussing this game or mtg or even the philosophy of why to or not to cracking packs.\nThank you again for this.
I actually forgot about that card. Neat.\nHonestly the only reason I built this is so I can have a toned down deck to play in my play group. We're pretty small and not very competitive. And it's fun to lose with so all the better.

Saying that RCR has to be funny is against the spirit of the show, I feel. While the fart humor and silly songs are fun, the history of automotives and literary analysis that accompany them are interesting.\nLet's look at it this way; the first word of the show is "regular". Right off the bat, there are two assumptions we can make about the show from this word. The first is that the content is something ordinary, normal, or routine. Fair enough, we see cars everyday. Most of us probably drive, use public transit, or at least look out at the town or city and see cars.\nThe second assumption is that the text or speech is plain and what someone could expect to say about the subject. These two definitions about the text seem contradictory. Typically review shows try to come off as sounding smart (I understand the irony of what I'm doing in saying this, but here we are) and with a higher perspective relative to the audience who just want a plain worded answer. RCR does both very well by going in depth about the subject and still maintaining a light "so what" with a positive attitude.\nThe show reminds me that for every subject I think I understand how everyone should perceive a thing, there's always something at least a couple ticks different in another person's head. Once presented with a different understanding, my perception grows: along with my interest.

Then, when the band has a terrible debut album, some hipster will yell "THIS BAND SOX!!" The second album will sell 7 times as well and then the success will come.
I laughed a bit harder than I should have. Good one.
That's why all the tables are nailed down. Hopefully.
Right now actually. I like it, myself. It's very raw and true to itself without losing their over-the-top nature. It feels more like a self reflection album and it's got a powerful feeling.
There came a gental fapping; fapping at my chamber door.
Becky fell for the injured arm again?
I still regularly try to use the premier manes, but it is difficult. Twilight and Rarity are the only ones who seem to still muster use compared to their cn counterparts. I kind of wish aj's errata was "reaction: after a friend is dismissed by an effect, put it on top of your deck" but that just reinforces my wish for a dredge reanimator style deck.\n\nOn another note, a fun thing we do in my play group is use the mane 6 to decide who goes first. What you do is have them in solid back sleeves then pick one. Your opponent has three guesses. If they get it, they choose play or draw. If they don't, you choose. It's created a lot of fun when we're just eating dinner too.
Hey, why are you the president of the clu-  wait, I can guess.
He wishes he had a twin.
I think you're being really greedy with the colors. Tangled Coifure is practically unplayable with its 4 requirement. And since flipping twilight is your only reliable blue entry besides 2 cloudchasers, you're going to be pushing into the late game more often than not. Really, I think it comes down to 3 roads; be a tempo deck with purple blue, be a taxes style deck with purple white, or go aggro with blue white. Not knowing your card pool, probably the easiest of the 3 would be the aggro shell. Especially with the Two Bits making Holly Dash cheaper.\nIf you're dead set on three colors, there are always fixers and you can swap to gala greeter as a mane.
Well I'm ugly and poor. Echo makes jade statues of poor, ugly people?
Give Watchmen a shot for a different superhero movie/comic. Way way different and awesome.
Which is funny considering the actor for said male character.
This sounds like an awesome experience. 
My friend who went last year said they sold boxes but not singles. Not sure about this year.

This is the second time this week that someone has mentioned this show. Used to love it as a kid. Especially adventures with Bill.
Brain Damage?
I don't think he does literary analysis.for YouTube, but he's started multiple times he and the Roman were English majors.
Episode 13 of Welcome to Nightvale. So good. Still my favorite episode. I recommend the whole podcast, but that episode is amazing.
Up vote for foxy. Sad about the hiatus though.
The album is free for download on their website.
I recommend watching Stein's;Gate. It's a time travel anime and visual novel that does it very differently than a lot of what I've seen before. It's not about how overpowered tune travel is but how you handle the power.
You sound like me. I'm in the "sure, I can afford a place in a couple of months to move out" phase working at a local high school. Hopefully everything will be fine.
That's adorable. She's a keeper.

Thank you for your suggestion. 
Sorry for being vague was on mobile at that time.  It's owned and built by one person typically, or by a collective group.  So yes, you do get to put in whatever you want if you build a cube.  If you're going to be putting it together with another person, it's probably a good idea to write down whose cards are whose for when it comes time to add new stuff and take stuff out.  Also, all cards go back in when you're done drafting.  It's less messy than opening packs, and typically, you can expect deck archetypes to appear more frequently depending on what you've added to the cube.  It's literally build a set with what's lying in your binder or shoe boxes or however you store cards.
I have a predisposition to diabetes from my dad. My mom's side of the family all have high blood pressure, heart problems, an aversion to vegetables... Luckily I only have the diabetes so far.
Curious about the angel beats deck. Would like a list if possible.

I agree with this as a current lover of the game. There are more formats than the rotating one you're talking about though. I love modern where you can use any card from 8th core set to today. I love legacy which is everything ever printed, with a cab list of course. But far and away more than those, I love commander/edh.\nCommander is basically 100 card singleton with a couple caveats. First pick a legendary creature. It's your deck's leader. The other 99 cards must be within that commander's color identity. So you can't play a blue card in a red green white commander deck. The commander sits separate from the other 99 and you can cast it any time you normally could. The game plays the same but with 40 life and if you take 21 combat damage from any one commander, even your own, you lose. The games vary wildly in this format.
I like your approach to the subject. It mostly seems to be a person to person issue. Everyone is slightly different in their morality, right?\nPersonally, I am a center left on the spectrum. I constantly am getting bashed by my own friends when they read a sensationalized headline and I try to argue specifics, sometimes from the same article. It mostly seems to stem from young people and idealogues (third wave feminism, BLM, etc etc). I think my perspective comes from a place of skepticism on both sides.
Sad times. That's the opposite side of the country. Road trip one summer then.

My buddy's valedictorian speech borrowed from the likes of Hamlet, Finding Nemo, 300, Atilla the Hun, Talladega Nights, and Matk Twain. Best speech ever. 
It is basically like designing a set but with cards already in existence. You have enough cards for a 6 or 8 person draft. Everyone shuffles all the cards together and randomly sort them into enough "packs" for the draft. Then draft with them. A 6 player cube for this game should have 288 cards and an 8 player cube should have 392 cards minimum. Of course, everyone curates their cube differently so you can have more or design for fewer players. Entirely your choice!
And so all women become lesbians in protest, then harvest your sperm for the limited future of mankind. Because you choose to arm yourself with yourself.\n\nOr a sick orgy. Who knows?
That's how people shark pokemon tcg. Almost everytime the majority of top cut was x-1 with only a round 1 loss. The reason in pokemon is round quality. You earn more rating for a win in the later rounds and lose more for losing. So instead of opponent quality, it's how well you can shark a swiss lottery.
I am the Cloudchaser.  I had designed his deck for GenCon (couldn't go myself, as I judged the event at our LGS and I had to work that week) but had to leave a little wiggle room for his pet cards because he couldn't stand not playing them.  But we both enjoy playing the game our different ways and with the other 2 people at our weekly meetups, so everything is fun!

WWE's trolling is about to end.
Enzo vs Cesaro? This should be a squash.

Sasha used to say that too. Naomi is just taking it over.

Kick Strowman in the nuts and take the DQ.
That ending was GLORIOUS.
Bryaaaannnnnnnnn! Get better security.
Isn't Tessa Blanchard also dating Ricochet?
Wrestlemania 33 Gillberg vs Ellsworth. Book it, Vince.
Is he talking about Seth or Finn?
Cesaro was doing his best Sasha Banks impression with that botch.
The Viper who makes you pay the piper.
That would be an interesting group with Cedric as the cruiserweight. They could add as extra guy for thr heavyweight title.
The next WWE film -  Run, Jobber, Run!
Now Jonathan Coachman should interview Matt Hardy for ESPN, during which Hardy announces that he is taking his broken brilliance to Connecticut.
Among the women in WWE, Asuka and Charlotte seem to be on a whole other level. 
Having big talent is worthless if the writing is crap. Smackdown Live has better writers who do more to elevate much of lesser known talents that it has. Also, the writers make the feuds between big name talents that they have and the titles bigger than Raw's writers do.

Why are people saying Joe is not allowed to use the Muscle Buster? Didn't we go through this with AJ and the Styles Clash? The first Muscle Buster is probably being saved for a PPV.
Can you imagine all of the glorious mic work if there was a feud between Austin Aries and The Miz?
Jimmy is slowing morphing into Umaga.
I don't care about Naomi, so I am very happy to have her relinquish the title. Alexa Bliss forever.
Tyson Kidd and Cesaro have changed recently.
Why? Tell me, why?
I actually enjoyed that match.
Fuck Okada/Omega, I give that segment 7 stars.

Tyler Bate vs No Way Jose, book it, Triple H.
Well, Samoa Joe just turned face for half the crowd.
Charlotte is fucking amazing.

I can't watch Liv Morgan without Corey Graves shitting on New Jersey.
Top guys for the top show?
Ascension vs Sanity
Did people from Chicago drive to Green Bay for Raw?
Atheists are not a monolithic group that thinks the same way. Some atheists criticize Islam as much as they criticize Christianity, and there are some atheists who are soft on Islam. While I do not know the specific motivations of those soft on Islam, but I do know, personally, some people that identify as agnostic, and they are supportive of Islam because they believed that they are showing solidarity with 'brown people' against oppressive whites.  If I try to point out the ridiculousness of their position, I am labelled Islamophobic. They won't call me racist because I am black which gives me minority points in their minds.
Wrestlemania - Knee vs Quad match.
The Arm Break Kid vs The Bliss Face Kid.
My mind is blown from the number of times that i have heard that shitty song.
No matter who wins this match, it doesn't matter because of Jojo's presence, we all win.
Eva Marie or Mandy Rose should have had match for Corey Graves' last night at NXT.

Are those the only options?
How can any man be SAWFT whenever Lana is around?
When Asuka asked who Ember Moon is, Cathy should have said Athena from the indies. Then Asuka would know who she was.
Did Nikki dye her hair? because it is looking very dark tonight
Samoa Joe - Triple H, do you need better security? I am your man.

It is a stipulation in his contract.
Bobby Roode had more ladies.
I hope there is an AA from the top of one of the pods.
Stephen Lang could play Vince.

What about chewing or vaping kids?
Tell me about it, I was super excited when I got a legit copy of it for like $30. Now I just Battalions of Fear, I believe, to complete my collection!
Ehhh, I'd say Conquest had the potential to be an awesome game (I still love it btw). Now Battle for Middle Earth, the turn based LotR game on the Game Boy Advance, the cinematic Two Towers and Return of the King games, and The Third Age, those were awesome.\n\nBut I would love Conquest to get a sequel.
He's pining for the fjords.

No, some smart people may agree with me and some dumb people may agree with me. Just like some smart people will disagree with me and some dumb people will disagree with me.\n\nI'm not necessarily defending Mr. Spencer's worldview, but I'll defend his freedom to have that worldview. Just like I'd defend the worldview of black supremacist movements. But what are we seeing more of in this country nowadays, gangs of white people hunting down black people for the color of their skin or who they voted for? Or gangs of black people hunting down white people for the color of their skin or who they voted for? I just believe that you should have the freedom to voice your opinion and worldview (communist, fascist, nat soc, conservative, white supremacist, black supremacist, right wing, left wing, whatever else) without the threat of violence upon you.\n\nThat being said, I also perfectly understand the schadenfreude most people get from seeing him get punched. I'm not gonna claim moral high ground and say I don't enjoy seeing communists get that same treatment.
Generally I see it as the lesser of two evils order under a dictator who more or less just cares about his own patch of sand, or disorder under rebels who will most likely foment international Islamic terrorism. Not ideal, but I don't think Assad is calling for Muslims in America to commit lone wolf attacks.

"Acceptable opinion" yep, that's totally an okay precedent to set. I think communists are the absolute scum of the earth and one of the greatest evils the world faced, yet I'd never assault one just for being a communist.\n\nAlso, how many people has Mr. Spencer sent off to camps or killed so far?
Pls go
Well that's a ringing endorsement if I ever heard one, I'll definitely be keeping an eye out for Appleton, as well as the others. Thanks a ton.\n\nNow probably my favorite mixed drink is rum and coke with either triple sec or grenadine. Do you know if any of the ones you listed would go particularly well with either of those? In my limited experience I've found the dark rum goes best with the coke and grenadine and a spiced rum goes great with coke and triple sec.

Nah, I wasn't wondering. I never bother looking in a comment section to see if something's been said any anyway. If I'm the first, hey cool beans; if not, oh well.
One thing I forgot to add to add is I also support the idea of a single man in charge of the party and country. My ideal scenario is a single autocratic leader, but divy the country up into sections with a governor in charge of each section. And give the governors the power to balance the power of the head of state if a majority of them come together. I'm not sure how well that would actually work in practice, but I do support the idea of an autocratic leader, I believe the more people involved in the process of governing, the more messy and inefficient things get. Would that still line up with national conservatism?

Which sometimes works when you have an army of knights and they surround the infantry and turn into a meat grinder. But it sucks when you just light lancers.\n\nI will say though, that the horse archer AI in 1257 is top notch. Fighting Muslims and Greeks is the absolute worst.

It's all good, probably the only more "basic" drink I could have mentioned is Malibu coconut (which is the only other rum I've tried that I like so far lol).

Also there should be a decently high strength requirement to parry hits from someone on horseback. That always pissed me off.
Yeah, the turn based one. And really? I would say the Game Cube Hobbit, LotR: Tactics, or Aragorn's Quest were the worst games. The Fellowship GBA game and then later the Fellowship PS2 game were probably the most book-evocative LotR games I've played.
Blue Bloods is such a based show, from what I've seen of it.
If I'm bored and in bed and I can't find anything else to watch I'll throw on a video of theirs to watch while I go to sleep.
Thanks for the clarification, and I know it shouldn't surprise me, but it's mind boggling that we're doing that. Assad may be a terrible dictator, but at least to my knowledge his goal isn't to infect other countries with radical fundamental Islam (or I guess I should just say regular Islam) like the rebel groups associated with Al Quaeda and the like?

Noted, any particular brand recommendations? Preferably around the $20-30 range. Still a college student lol.

Wal-Mart had this great idea of opening mini Wal-Marts in rural areas that were too small for a regular Wal-Mart. The low prices of these minis destroyed the competition in the area and they became the only grocery stores around.\n\nBut the brass at Wal-Mart didn't think about operating expenses versus their famous low prices. Almost immediately after killing the other grocery stores in these regions, the mini Wal-Marts were shut down. Leaving many parts of the country without access to food, water and other items.

I cannot stand the transcendant argument. What sort of transcendant being could possibly care or even communicate to us how or why we should behave a certain way. One second he is a lersonal god, caoable of deep levels of conncetion and empathy, the next he's so removed from the universe as to be inconsequential.\n\nEdit: this is an issue I have with any religious interpretation of god. Secular, spiritualist approaches have slightly better arguments due to a lack of doctrine or implied intent.\n\nEdit 2: For a rare example of well mannered and informative discussion between people who disagree on the internet, follow this thread. Kudos everyone.
For me typically:"I've felt him". To whit my response os "I havent, does he want me to fail?"
And your rebuttal was the ad hominem "other people did it so its ok" tu quoque approach? That is not a valid criticism of the point being made.
I agree. However, whats more interesting to me is the origin of viruses or destiny of parasites. Both of which lead me to the conclusion that evolution has/will result in life becoming non-life, based on thise descriptors (aforementioned parasites are already well in their way).
Try finding a scientist who isnt fanatically ibsessed with their experiment. You have no idea how excited I get over tiny green circles.
What I meant is that whilst we think and are therefore alive, not all things that are alive think. Thought, and by extension conciousness is a particular aspect of life but not a contigent of it. We understand how "thinking" creatures work, i.e. muscles, digestion, but the brain is too complex at the moment to fully decipher and therefore a scientific explanation of conciouness has yet to be explored to any satisfying degree. That is not to say that life has not.\n\nAdditionally, because of this, we still do not know if other naimals are concious. I would be intrigued to see the societal ramifications if we discover, for example, if Orcas are capable of many of the higher thought functions we once attributed to concious thoight and therefore uniquity of man.
To be fair, no one nation is truly responsible for ending the war more than othera. Especially when a fair share made it possible in the first place. Without US steel, for example, there could not have been a Nazi war machine. Alternatively, had Britain acquisced, it would have been US vs Europe and Russia and China without the ANZAC forces having access to friendly ports on European soil. So kindly think before jumping into that big ol vat of nationalist soil. Everyone played their part in ending that war, they all deserve respect and honour.
Theyve started adding KOTOR characters to one of the mobile games. No other non-cannon characters in the entire game. Coincidence?
I thought as much myself, but I had the problem with 8gb and it persisted when I upgraded to 16gb.
Tunisia is not on that list. Also, the attacks in france were politically motivated. To see why, I suggest reading up on French colonialism. They may be uniting under the ISIS banner, but the terrorists attacking the US and those in Europe have done so under different pretenses. This is as logical as Rome Banning people from Eire vecause of the troubles.
Trust me, Disney World is great for kids but awesome for adults. Nothing will ever beat the day me and 4 other lads, including an active soldier, sang our hearts out in the Frozen singalong.

True. But you have to thing in 3d and realise how much you can fit in there with asteroids etc and still have vast amounts if empty space. Hell. In 3AU we have a planet of molton rock, a planet with acid rain, an oasis and a moutainous ex-volcanic planet. Then we also have a meteor belt and several moons.\n\nI worried about the same thing, then realised we havent even left earth orbit with a manned craft yet.
Additonally, you bennefit from other around you not being sick. Everything from the obviius like hospital waiting lines to the obscure like food production or literally any market dependant on manual labour. The economic burden of things as simple as tapeworms is crippling in some countries. If we were to allow vaccinable diseases like polio or mumps to resurface, entire countries would crumble. Sounds absurd, because it is, doesnt mean its not true.
Do members of your team randomly get replaced over time?

Or...maybe global conflict isnt such a simple concept and rhetoric like yours shows a shocking lack of understanding regarding that. Like I said, all nations are deserving of respect for their role in ending WWII.
The same can be said of Christianity and Budhism. The fact remains that humanity is capable of producing some utter shits and consistently killing people doesnt work against ideologies, only regimes. Education and diplomacy are the true death of radicalism. Yet, understandably, very few want to risk the lives of them and their families to achieve this. Its a catch 22, which is why simple yet illogical radical viewpoints thrive in these situations. Its very easy to ignore that which you refuse to understand. It jusy comes down to which side hates dying more, which is us and that is why if we continue to fight fire with fire we will be the ones to burn out first. Because we dont actually want to die.
Hell yes! This is what people should be aiming for. A job you can be proud of and enjoy doing. Something so few people achieve. Have a great time OP, Im happy for you!
Im not talking about existential. Im talking about the fact that any potential future war would immediately involve these people. Many are in it just for the money, granted. The same can be said for emergeancy personel. Perhaps Im not conveying myself properly, i respect all living people. However, those who choose to serve in a profession that puts my life above their own deserve my respect and gratitude. It is not what they do, but rather what is expected of them that is worthy of respect.
Good job there hasnt been one from any of the banned countries, will his supporters concede that if a future attack originates from a non-banned country like pakistan, egypt or afghanistan?
I'm pretty sure every leader in the world has voiced their opinions on other nations elections. It's part of being a spokesperson. What we are discussing here is the potetnial difference *if* Russia interfered. Which, as I pointed out, is unlikely because we'd have seen a larger response. However, to say that Obama and *only* obama has interfered with elections is not just dishonest its outright lying. Furthermore, just because 1 man has does something wrong, it is not acceptable therefore for others to do so. 2 wrongs do not make a right, a fundamental in western ethics so much so we expect our children to understand it.\n\nI repeat, I am not defending Obama, I am stating that his behaviour, whilst wrong, is moot when discussing the wrong doings of other nations.
I loved the whole vibe of the set.... why have I not being using this colour scheme!
I remember reading somewhere that France actually has the best military rexord in the world. Unfortunate that they are only remembered for the most recent fights. Ironically, the UK who is currently high on Imperial nostalgia, has been succesfully invaded so many times in the last ~1000 years that the fact its france with this stereotype in actually hilarious. (Same goes for football)
I will never tire of this reference.
To be fair, it is one thing to voice an opinion, it is another to allegedly interfere with the election machinary and system. Although, I have my doubts whether Russia did more than put thoughts and words into peoples heads. Im prettt sure if the attack was a serious as people make out it would have garnered a bigger reaponse than ot got.
Cheaper too probably.
The greatest curse of man is to impront logic and order where there is none. For creation to exist without deliberate cause makes no sense, why bother existing, what was wrong with nothingness. To add a creator with intent gives a reason for existence. The argument seems silly now because we are far more aware, and comfortable I like to think, that shit happens. Just necause there was no reason or purpose, the thing is not invalid.

My concern, as someone who thinks most of todays issues in politics come down to political ignorance and miselading campaigns, is entirey valid regarding your post. Honesty and honour were supposed to be virtues, not tired vestments to be discarded as we see fit.

Just to be clear, science has derermined the definition of a word. There is no uniform divide between life and non life. That is to say that at its most basic, a "live" cell is a hell of a lot less complex than you would imagine. Converesely, people often underestkmate the complex nature of "inanimate" chemical reactions because they see thibgs from an anthroporphic time scale. I.e. 100s of years not millions. If I had to define life at its most simple, it would be the onservable phonemena of natural reactions occuring at unnatural rates (i.e. enzymes etc)
Nice contribution. I can see you are a shining example of wit.
Want to go back over those numbers and see how many came from the banned countries buddy? Also, you might want to double your definition of Europe. Turkey is no more part of europe than Israel. Bad argumemts make for easy redicule. Stop goving them cheap ammo.
This was my "moment" as a kid/tweenager that later led to me being 100%faithless. If there is a god, like the one in the bible I was raised with, he is both anthroporphic and transcedant. Those things are irreconciliable, how can we state with any certainity that we understand the word of god (i.e. any scripture or.prophet) yet if we can, he is not beyone understanding and therefore accountable to rational logic. Neither point could ever find a satisfying conclusion. Then I started reading and the concept of falsification is the bedrock upon which I built my world view. Now Im Dr Parazeit (well, 1 month to go) and as godless as the rocks from which we all came.
No no, thank you. People like yourself are and inspiration for so many yet to step into the mad world of jobs (I myself am.doing a hob I love so I can empathise with the feeling)
Yes it did. Mass effect 1 had an entire Code breaking mini-game that was heavily effected by skills. The engineer was an entire Class that specialised in that mini-game. By-pass and hacking were one of the casualties of the FPS focus switch in 2 and the trend seems to continue.
I'm not blaming the victims. Jesus H Christ does everything need to be written in Crayon? The motivation for the terrorist attacks differ by region, therefore implying that banning countries based on terrorism happening abroad is an idiotic tactic that ignores the complex nuances of geopolitics. All terrorists are scum. Not disputing that, just saying tunisian terrorists arent going to bomb america just because they bombed france.
Precisely my point. They've already done it and it didnt end well for either side. What makes you think they wouldnt do it again? I wouldn't he driving shit by the way. Just because I think this approach to safeguarding liberty is outdated doesnt mean  I side with the potential tyrants.
I bet. Even as a customer Legoland Windsor is a fucking nightmare, all those tired kids who want the most expensive kits (after insane ticket prices). Never wanted to shout at a kid as much as then. Places like Legoland definitely need adult only events regularly. Although i can see why they wouldnt. So much drink driving would occur. "I MAY BE 176CM AND 100KG BUT I WILL FIT IN THIS DAMNED CAR!"
That is beside the point. It simply does not matter what we control when arguing its ethics. I cannot control the behaviour of a foreign terrorist, does that mean somehow his actions are to go unchallenged?
Is this just an extension of the Dunning-Kruger effect? Those who are more aware of the hardships/responsibilities would be more likely to underestimate their potential ability as parents. Those who don't, obviously would consider the idea of parenthood to be a breeze.

In not saying they all are, im just saying that noy all of them arent. Science is almost universally taughy in English because all the major publishers only publish in English. Additionally, as science is multinational by nature it has adooted English as the Universal language. In short, if you dont speak english you would find a career in the sciences exceedingly difficult. Hence it makes sense to teach it in english in the first place.

Well im done for today folks.  thanks for that.
I'm pretty sure it isn't, especially when previous administrations have gone so far as to insight outright coups. [Even then, most of the western nations have a track record of interfering with other nation's electoral processes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_electoral_intervention)\n\nFor the last time, what Obama did **WAS** wrong. However, that does not diminish the wrong doing of any other interventions, especially those done covertly.
There's also the concept that action (a) will have the result (1) even if the intention was (2). Basically, the same changes in culture that lead to more ritualistic behaviours would have had the bi-product of more efficient and effective communities: Better hunting success, social development and healthcare all derive their success from a sense of shared goals/unity. Religion, or at least religious practices continually show throw as excellent adaptations in humanity. E.g. (a) Burying your dead will reduce (1) disease exposure even though you only did it because (2) you were conditioned to do so by early social conventions.
The cosmological term is steady state theory. A constant stream of particles degrading into new particles. To put it another way, this universe is simply the decomposed corpse of thenone before it.

So your solution to terrorism is what, incite more of it? You must be a troll because no one could possibly be this naive.
I'd imagine even if submerged, the rapidly developing state of active tracking would have made that constant link even more deadly had they not adopted the fire and forget model.

As I am not a physiscist I do not know which reference is more respectable [So instead I'll link the wiki page, just scroll down to references and read to your heart's content](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Island_of_stability#cite_note-physorg-2) but from what I understand, the entire reason the theory exists is because it has been predicted mathematically.
Uk, france, germany, sweden, norway, denmark, Czech Republic, Switzerland, australia. Literally anyone of those and more treat their citizenry with more respect than the US. But of course we're dirty socialists, must all be propoganda.
Does not explain the absence of pakistan or afghanistan, which both pose more if an immediate threat than Iraq or Iran and always have regarding terorism. Heck, only the Iranian administration is a threat to the US, their citizens are not compatable to the other countries on that list.
Nope, because now we're back again to one man's faults do not excuse another's. **Both** instances are wrong.
Alternatively, when we do use our own laws people still get pissed. Like the Article 50 legal battle. The irony meter broke that day.
I always think of UK and France as being sibling Rivals (UK is the upstart younger brother) who slept with each others girlfriends. 90% of the time they fucking hate each other. But only the UK is allowed to insult france. Anyone else messes with them, well an island nation held back one of the largest enemy forces seen in history for several years because some fucker messed with our big brother.
No! You don't get to ruin that beautiful moment for me, you shit! (Take an upvote though)
Exactly! No one has more of a right than anyone else to live anywhere. Its all bullshit.
Reminds me of [This lego set](http://images.brickset.com/sets/images/6175-1.jpg) from the 90s.
To answer your main question: life is just atoms. Really fancy, complex atoms but still atoms. Stars are fascinating but still "just" atoms. I dont really see anythung wrong with that. The bigger question is that of conciousness, I agree, especiallly as there is no concise answer anywhere near completion. But life and conciousness are seperate concepts.\n\nAs for creating life, we can and do to an extent. The issue now is more one of money and equipment and to what extent does novelty play arole in differeing creating life and genetically engineering it from preexisting life.\n\nI do not see.god around me, but the beautiful coincedence that is chaos. And I am greatful that the way reality arranged itself has goven me, whoever that is, the opportunity to experience it. I dont see how that is evidence of a divine creator anymore than I myself am God though.\n\nEdit: sorry i forgot to adress the other part. The philosophical question you refer to is better known as the ship of theseus. It is a fantastic philosophical question of the self and religious or not I think everyone should consider this as an example of how absolutism is an inherently flawed concept.\n\nI know its not exactly what tou were getting at but I do "think" about god every day. Anyone whi does not is doing a deservice to their potential as a self aware person to ignore one if the greatest philosophical devides of our species.\n\nEdit 2: I am not dyslexic, just really bad at typing on a phone without autocorrect.
True.  The recoil direction on Hakke is crap but CB makes it hard to land all 4 as crits.  Back before all the nerfs i had a herja that could do well in pvpv and was my go to in pve.  I have 2 of them with solid rolls but they dont seem to cut it anymore
It was also built by nations that were in a near constant state of war with one another. Drawing historical comparisons, in either direction, is a mistake unless you consider it in its entirity. Also "triggers the left" is just pandering, this kind of knee jerk "haha they're dumb" rehtoric is exactly why so many "lefties" claim intellectual superiority when the "right" resorts to name calling. There are indeed morons on the left, on yhe right too. Don't become one of them.
Are you sure? I was under the impression most of the sciences ate taught exclusively in English, according to my German, project supervisor at least.
Exactly what pH do they think the colon is? Or is colon cancer made up (hint, I grow it in the lab)
Here in lies the crux. You had a legitimate reason to be angry with the world and therefore did nit need to be "edgy" to justify it.\n\nEdit to say Im glad your still with us. You beat better odds than Ive ever had to. You have the respect of an anonymous internet stranger.
I find nothing in your reply that I disagree with. The issue I have is more with how it seems common to portray Islam as somehow unique when it is simply a combination of wrong belief at the wrong time. You are also right that many use the cultural relativism argument as an excuse. I am a relativist on most issues, however I would not use that as an excuse, merely an explanation. If culture is the problem, then it is the culture that needs to change. After all, the other religions cause less of an issue globally because their main "worship base" is from more culturally modern societies. So I think my point stands without contradicting yours, bombing people is not going to solve the issue anymore than excusing it. It is an issue that needs to be resolved, I certainly agree on that, I disagree with the current methods being employed.\n\nBut then my solution involves social programmes and free education, very much not up for contention in the current political climate.\n\nEdit: To explain more above, what I mean is that for Islam to undergo the reform you mention, the homeland cultures need to reform FIRST, then Islam will have its reformation. Christianity did not evolve into what we recognise today until after the Dark ages, because it needed that cultural reform from the enlightenment era to push those of the Christian faith forward.
Interestingly it may be that Louis Pasteur was the first to discover penicillin, but got so agitated with it killing his bacterial cultures that he sterilised the lot. This is based on his notes and is theorised to be the cause behind his "killer bacterium" hypothesis.
> The same can't be said of President Obama and other nations\n\n> I'm pretty sure spending hundred of thousands of dollars (as is the case with Israel's elections) is unprecedented as was attempt to influence the Brexit vote as the FT discussed in detail.\n\n> And if "tampering" is really an issue why didn't any of them say anything when a sitting U.S. president openly interfered in the Israeli elections and in the Brexit vote.\n\nThis is the very definition of a tu quoque argument. Or to put it in political terms "Butwhataboutism". Don't play their game. Show them who's right by acting out of compassion, not spite and jealousy. Those who lean naturally to the left will never be swayed by this sort of aggressive tone. And unless you want to force hem to adopt your ideology you'll just have to face reality and perhaps re-evaluate how you debate, because you can't even convince me.
Sorry, I'm not sure I understand your question.
I was thinking that unless they have a specific build of the game for each video, there was absolutely 0 GUI left that could house said skills. They focused on combat, sure, but we still got to see the menus. Guess we'll see when the next videos come out, but I think the fact that a formerly **R**PG focussed game showing combat first has set the tone.
I noticed the complete lack of **R**PG skills. Lots of actions based skills. Absolutely nothing that seems to refer to non-combat gameplay. This will be great for those who like FPS games, however I suspect for those of us that are more interested in telling our own story, it'll be just as immersive as fallout 4. Oh well, whatever makes the big bucks. Which apparently is not immersive story telling a-la ME1 or KOTOR.
Thats why they have riot vans and APCs. Firearms are only going to be useful to a point. But there will come a time where resistance will have to functiin as a civil war. At that point, drones and planes may very well do house to house 'searches'. The simple fact is, when this particular check and balance was concieved, the idea of these death machines was not. (Disclaimer, I am not and never have been a pacifist. I just prefer to call a spade a digging tool).
I agree, I was more talking about the counter radar missile systems that track their target's radar emission.
This. Too many conservatives, understandble to a point, are so overwhelmed in finally removing the Democrats from power that they are abandoning their principles just to "stick one to the lefties". That is not what it is supposed to be about. Both sides are supposed to care about doing things in the best way to bennefit mankind, just with different methods. This petty infighting and one upping will get us all killed eventually, by which point no one will be able to care whether it was the right or left who were responsible.
The counter to this is that you could consider the "virus shell" or virion as the egg. The actual virus is the infected cell and thus comes closer the the parasite anology (think severely obligate parasites like cryptosporidium or fungal parasites like microsporidia)\n\n- parasitologist who argues with next door virology frequently
Ollie ollie oxenfree! Or whatever the fuck that means. Seriously though, most rage inducing boss ever. But aside from that (or maybe including) AP was probably the single mist under rated game of all time. And one of the funniest.
Damage Referee?  That still around?
Whilst also true, the way life on earth is constructed (Carbon, oxygen etc) is not random. There is a significant amount of chemistry that determines most other chemicals would simply not be able to form a large enough variation of bonds/reactions to necessitate something that could be construed as alive. Anything "else" would likely be so alien as to not fit our definition of what it is to be alive anyway.\n\nEdit: To extrapolate on what I said above, if you were to list the [elements in the average carbon based life form](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Composition_of_the_human_body), in order of abundance, you'd get a statistically similar order to that of [the known universe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abundance_of_the_chemical_elements#Abundance_of_elements_in_the_Universe) (with the exception of noble gases). I.e, the consistency of known life, being one of a carbon/oxygen base, is based on a universal and not local law of chemistry.
Speaking as a bioscientist, who studies the evolution of organelles in single celled parasites, anything that talks about AI fascinates me.\n\nThere are many parrelels and comparisons one can draw between the evolution of machines and organisms. \n\nAdditionally the question of what it means to be "alive" and at what point machines become indistinguishable from life.
I think this is the crux of the liberal anti-capitilist vision. Because most of what they see at the moment is indulgent consumerism, with those representing the heads of business failing to inspire innovation at a significant level (Apple and Windows are great examples of giants that fell from their innovation pedestal).\n\nA lot of anti-capitilists and pro-statists would start to change their minds if more business leaders had a passion for their market like Musk. Science is also starting to see similar problems, with regulations and metrics seriously hampering innovation.\n\nUltimately this is their problem for conflating idealogies and refusing to see the big picture, but people like Musk can only help change that.
Be careful. I can dispute 1 easy: Viruses (prions make this even worse). 3 os also false, many enzymatic functions continue to function long after death. The difference between a "live" cell and a "dead" one is whether its core genetic machinary are still working.\n\nThere is no shame here though. Its a fault of the education system simplifying things because obviously you cant teach complex biology without the basics. That said, as a microbiologist theae arguments often happen with "macrobiologists" where definitions of alive and dead are a lot more clear cut.\n\nEdit: O cant decide if I hate my phone more or less without autocorrect
Its why, despite being an athiest, I have less ossue with obscure spiritualism. There is less of a claim to "know" the ethereal so there is **less** self evident contradiction.
The french and scotts invaded numerous times before the formation of GB. [Especially in the years 1000-1,500AD](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasion_of_England) 
I think a lot of people dont appreciate this blessing.
Not really, none of those countrirs are responsible for attacks on US soil (excluding embassies). Those that are, as many have pointed out, are conspicuously absent from the list.
And I suppose you're going to do it with a L.A.W.? Because if we're being honest here, the disparate gap between what a civilian could ever dream of purchasing and what the US government has access to is still underestimating the power of this battles...government. Lets face it, no one currently within reach of the law will ever secure an arms deal with Lockheed or HK.
Did I miss something, Trump uad 1 less blue box than Obama. Surely that, based soley off this graphic, Obama issued more EOs? Is this an error with the graph or am did I misunderstand?
New ones appear. Cancer is the threat it is now simply by virtue of us surviving long enough to get it. Once we cure all current kniwn diseases we will likely discover mire that we just died to soon to contract. Nature is cruelly ironic like that
How long did it take you to move all the deer in there?
Upvote for using a primary.  Oh wait you also have an Icebreaker?  I don't know how I feel about this.
Duel casting?
EVERYTIME
WHY I SWITCHED TO EXPLOSIVE PYRE.  LOVE TO WATHC THEM BURN.
Yes kind of close to the fort full of high elves
Could probably find it cheap , used at gamestop.
THEN PICK UP MY CREST WHEN I DIE AND REMEMEBER ME FOR WHO I WAS.
I was thinking this would be more of a HM raid gun.
FS is fun as hell to use in pve might take it for a spin later.  Might break out the Khovostov also.
Wish there were more creepy woods in Skyrim.
Yea there are a lot of armor and weapon packs ( well a few for consoles ) and followers.  Inigo is pretty cool to have around and he has a side quest.  
I was here first. \nChecks post history.\nDamn it
Have you ever died in supremacy?
You know he was a U.S senator and senior member of the armed forces committee.   
NOICE
Vacuum diagram 
NOPE.  SMART DRIFT CONTROL AND SQC BALLISTICS.  IT HAS REINFORCED BARREL , HCRS AND HOT SWAP SO IT MIGHT NOT SUCK.
I HAVE 3 HAWKS INCLUDING THE OLD VENDOR ROLL AND A PRETTY SOLID PDX.  GOD ROLL PVP COCYTUS AND SOME REALLY GOOD CRYPTIC DRAGONS AND NLX701 SHADOW.  ALL I WANT RIGHT NOW IS A AEGIS OF THE REEF AND A LORD HIGH FIXER WITH GOOD ROLLS.  INSTEAD I GET CROWS EYE AND THAT BULLSHIT SNIPER.
Sure you didn't turn them in of trash them?  
I have 1 with reinforced barrel , HCRs and rangefinder also but thought this one would do better for pve.
IMO its one of the best looking guns in game and a lot better than the crap rifle IB has now.
I just use breeze home.  You can get an alchemy set.  The blacksmith is next door and theres an enchantment table in dragons reach.  \n\nNo which ever chest you put your stuff thats where it stays.
MORE HOJ REP!!!!!!!!!
Never new about this.  What happens if you drop a blessing of light bubble
As long as ships do idc.
MY MIDA ISNT SUPER HIGH LIGHT.  AROUND 390.  I HAD A 400 LL UNBENT TREE DROP AND NO IDEA WHAT TO PUT IT INTO. I LIKE THE DISTANT STAR FOR PVE ALOT IT CAN WORK IN PVP ONCE YOU GET USED TO IT BUT ITS NO MIDA.
I bought a Pali but still haven't leveled it up.  It just doesn't look good to me.
I loved them in the beginning of TTK.  Now they suck
He was a senator and senor committee member.  He spoke with several foreign ambassadors during that time I'm sure.  Which isn't illegal.
its pretty funny seeing what you did while black out drunk.\n\nSolstheim has some cool armor and a few weapons but for the most part I stay on the mainland.  Try and find death brand armor.
How many thieves died down there?
So is hammer forged plus rangefinder with agg balls a good roll?
Oh.  I use to play on 360 like you , then I bought a copy of Skyrim at gamestop for 30 bucks.
If you get the mod the redoes the perk tree I think it give you 5% back on your weapon's charge.
Do you always get a purple engram?
Enchant weapons with healing powers.  try using paralyze poison on him.  do you have the slow time shout? 
You can always mod the hell out of it.  Get inigo and just walk around killing stuff.  Try to get to level 81 and take on the ebony warrior 
You can do the darkbrother hood quest for a horse.  You can get the best alight armor in game by going to solstheim. Find a guy in a bar who wants to be your drinking buddy.  Wearing all black , buys you some drink.  Its a great quest.
I love IB but dawddamn the lag is horrible.  Not being able to pick up crest , people not taking damage , people shooting through walls , heavy ammo not spawning and the almighty GREEN BAR TELEPORT GODS.
Maybe different character
I bought the game day 1 and its the only game I have spent a lot of time in since then.  600+hours.  Got an xbone just to keep playing it.  Does it have its downsides? Yes but the gameplay is amazing , the graphics are top.  Yea the story was short.  Yes lag in pvp is god awful.  RNG is take your first born and give you a piece of shit gun that has never been good no matter the meta.  \n\nA lot of people who complain about destiny have 4000 hours into it and 13 characters on 4 systems.  Some people haven't given it a chance.  Not everyone is going to like it.  I'm looking forward to playing Destiny 2 , hell im not but ME Andromeda so I can save my money for it.  
What mod gives back packs?  It bothers me that me character is has 2 tons of gear and no backpack.
Salt seems to have died down a little bit.  Hopefully with they fix the sidearm ammo issue and people wont be using them as primaries.
JUST DROP A LIGHTNING GRENADE AT YOUR FEET BEFORE YOU DIE.
Become a werewolf.  Just do the companions quest line  , become a werewolf and never worry about it.
Become a werewolf see if that helps.
I don't know either.  I remember reading about it but never seen it happen.  Wasted lots of ammo while shooting laggers though
He didn't break the law.  its not like he took 2.5 million dollars from the Russians and sold 20% of the U.S Uranium production. 
I hate how they outrange my autorifles and even my hawksaw.
isn't it just like 2 parts.  You find out about her and kill her.
It depends on the lobby.  some lobbies are full of laggy trespassers who don't take damage and can shoot through walls.  Other lobbies are actually fun and people are using primaries.  I'm just tired of being the only one on my team picking up crest.  I did my bounties on my main , IB has nothing to offer me.  I'm done with it.
Answering Chords and down and doubts is all I get. 
Did you take the picture through a screendoor?
I know I was going to make a joke that if you don't die in supremacy that you can keep your emblem.
How can he afford a mansion with his salary? /s
I never had a good deal breaker.  wish I had bought the old vendor roll with CC , Cb and BF.  Might grind for marks , delete RoI and see if I can buy it.
Maybe I did.  either it was a giant let down.
Have you used any of the Hakke PRs.  Stability isn't their strong point.
Supremacy is either really fun or god awful.  I got so tired of it I went and played some rift afterwards.  not dieing to sidearms every .6 seconds is nice.
Go to a inn and ask the bar man about rumors 
WHEN MY RADAR LIGHTS UP RED I REALIZED I MADE A MISTAKE AND DEATH WILL COME QUICKLY FOR ME.
This is what I want to know.  Senators use to brag about how close they were to foreign ambassadors but now it seems like its against the law. 
THEN KILL THEM DONT JUST STARE AT THEM
I have been wanting to download this mod.  might do it tonight
Got The Continental with CC , HLS and CB.  It does pretty well when im not having sidearms shoved up my bum. 
What nade bubble?  I have opened up tons of those chest. Slow bomb goes off , invis guys attack you and die.  
Whats that weird compass thing in the left top corner?
I'm not a sniper but that sounds pretty good.
Stayed away from reddit cause i thought it was full of hateful bitter internet troll.  I was semi wrong
Yes.  Im on my 3td playthrough and using mods.  You can get new armor , weapons , followers and quest 
Been chasing a god roll LHF since it came back.  Only been killed by it a few times
You can use the stead stone and it adds 100 points of carry and removes the weight of your amor.
Seems like i have this place before in a history show.  Or all European county sides look the same.
Really?  Can you just up it to max difficulty before opening a chest?
Ok cause one committee member didn't meet with the Russian ambassador doesn't mean the other cant.  He has meet with a a lot of foreign ambassadors as a senator.  I bet the vast majority of senators have.   
I was told only Jeff Sessions met with Russians.  Did media and reddit lie to me?
DO YOU LET PEOPLE BARROW IT?
Where is this?  This looks familiar
I try not to either but when the fastest killing gun in the game is a sidearm and you need them wins.  what roll is on your hatchet?
What are you playing on?
I always survive it and don't think I ever gotten a purple engram.
How hard is it to get a warrant to wire tape a private citizen?  
I HAVE 1 ITS OK.  I PREFER MY HAWKSAW.  I HAVE A "GOD ROLL " BADGER WITH HOT SWAP , HLS AND HIDDEN HAND BUT IT JUST SEEMS TO MOVE SLOW.
Yea i use to be able to 2 tap in the beginnig  of TTK and take out trash mods with ease.  They just seem slow and outdated.  Its cool the fire 4 bullets but they spread is awful and the crits dont do enough.damage.  they theoretical ttk is great but in reality hardly happens.  Wish they could buff them a little
I normally hate rift but I have the weekly bounty.  Did the supremacy bounty and got a blue engram YAY!  I was that guy who went to the corner of the map and picked guys up with my villainy , nirwens mercy and pantheon shot.  Felt good to use primaries. 
I think 3rd party LFGs are a pain and 1 reason why i dont raid more often.  Thank Talos the neckbeards are Microsoft put in groups.  If it wasnt for groups i never would have done a raid.\n\nIf there was an ingame LFG i think that would make life alot easier for raiders and help the rest of the community get into it.
Maybe he hates cabbage 
Did you keep it?
The biggest danger to you is yourself.
Yea...but...eh...I know.
I don't snipe so im swimming in god roll snipers.  I have the year 2 sniper with hidden hand but never take it out.  Never had any god rolled nirwens of hatchets drop.  If I could get a hatchet with BF , CB  I would spluge in my pants
> You're applying the comic in a private only manner because it fits your narrative\n\nNo, I'm applying the comic exactly as written where it explicitly sets up "the government" and "anyone else" in the first two panels. There's no need to bend this specific comic to your opinion, just pick a different comic. There are several.\n\n> Did I miss the constant headline news of Obama attacks on the press\n\nNo, but apparently you missed the current president literally calling the press the enemy on multiple accounts. Comparing the two in this manner is ridiculous, and you know it.
> Keep saying that excluding certain news agencies from press briefings is a violation of the first\n\nI never said that. I said that using a comic explaining how the 1st limits government but not the public is a terrible example to use in support of a president taking punitive action against the press for their speech. I *explicitly* mentioned how this was not penal action.\n\n> You didn't seem to care when Obama did it.\n\nInaccurate. There were multiple occasions when Obama did it. That said he did not use the official press briefings as a punitive action and instead hosted separate "private" ones, but the principle being violated is the same. If Trump's goal was to repeat the sins of Obama, he could have easily set up separate briefings with his chosen reporters and made less fuss.
"Hundreds of millions" is not "a good amount" of 25 billion.\n\nIt's not nothing, but it's definitely not much.
> Why don't we just tax sugar at a higher rate since that seems to be the issue.\n\nSodas are one of the largest sugar sources for most people, so this effectively *is* a sugar tax. We tell patients to swap sodas for water all the time and it's one of the easiest ways to see dramatic improvement.\n\nI fully support sin taxes for cigarettes, sugary drinks, and other things that make my job harder needlessly.\n\nIf you're going to slowly kill yourself and force others to eventually deal with it, you should have to work harder to do so.
Keep saying what?\n\nIt's not like the constitution is hidden. You can read what the 1st amendment says for yourself and how it has been used in court if you disagree with the legal interpretation.
I think that was the point of CRA in '64.
>The one "showing the door" in this case is the president.\n\n>That comic is explicitly stating how the 1st amendment applies to punitive government action (specifically penal), but not private sector.\n\n>That's pretty much the worst example to further your point in this situation.
I propose that the government respect the establishment clause and not interfere with religions.\n\n> I propose that Islam goes through a liberalization process.\n\nWhat does that mean logistically? What exactly are you proposing? I'm not familiar enough with French law to make an informed comment on how their system differs, but anyways I am an American concerned with the future of America. The French can handle their problems as they see fit.
The answer is obviously yes.\n\nI don't mean to be rude, but I'm confused as to where this line of questioning is coming from given that I never implied anything to the contrary and the definition that I gave explicitly includes attacks of that nature.\n\n
It is in no way a strawman argument.\n\nWe have demonstrable evidence of the damage that alcohol and tobacco do, and it is inarguably significantly greater than even the most extreme assessments of that caused by marijuana by any objective metric aside from criminality.\n\nThe question posed was, "why is this thing illegal when two more dangerous ones are legal?"
> let a little time pass\n\nNope. No difference between now and the rest of eternity of this being terrible.\n\nI was out there defending Cam before he went and straight up said that he gave up on the play for selfish reasons. That was garbage. The fact that we just managed to fail in the most spectacular way possible doesn't absolve anyone else's character flaws.
Was looking for this one.
What do you think would be the likely outcome in a future scenario where no national organizing body existed for liberal politicians?
> number needed to treat AKA success rate\n\nThis was a bit off, but you're getting the message across well. NNT is calculated by taking the inverse of the success rate.
>  USED to be sort of a common theme among the left\n\nI'm not that old, but I have no idea what you're talking about here. The Catholic church is probably the most associated with pedophilia in our societal consciousness, and since the revival of the abortion debate they've been seen as conservatives.\n\nI don't think "the left used to do it, too" will be anywhere near as effective at moving past this as simply vehemently disowning this person will be given that most won't know what you're talking about.
> violating the mission statement\n\nWhat now?
> What is the fact?\n\nThat those interviewed had their words were taken out of context. There is support for that claim given the video showed no mention of immigration as claimed.\n\nThe only one who could provide *further* evidence of that has strong motivation not to do so as it would damage their reputation.
> imposing the public banning of Muhammad on everyone around them\n\nConstitutional freedom of religion is a restriction on the government. Random Muslims complaining about things that insult Islam are not prohibited from doing so.\n\n*Violent* complaining is already prohibited by multiple other laws regardless of what page anyone is on. What more do you propose beyond that?\n\nI think media outlets should be free to avoid displaying anything that they don't see as useful. You won't see many Viagra commercials on Nickelodeon for example.
OP was asking about the more recent NYT article about aides during the campaign.\n\nFlynn's issue was isolated to *after* the campaign but before inauguration unless I missed something.
> No, I'm applying the comic exactly as written where it explicitly sets up "the government" and "anyone else" in the first two panels. There's no need to bend this specific comic to your opinion, just pick a different comic. There are several.
You hand your own gloves to the scrub nurse for her to help you put them on.\n\nActually you usually open the package and let the nurse grab them rather than "handing" it to them, since the latter would cause a bit of an issue.
> or they can burn\n\nOr they can continue to be supported by people less liberal than you.
Chlamydia is bacterial, and it is very simple to treat for most cases.
> furthering the legitimacy of either ISIS or al-Qaeda\n\nISIS and al-Queda are explicitly Islamic organizations, so yes.\n\n> attempting to drag the US into a war of attrition\n\nNope, unless the underlying disdain for the U.S. is rooted in Islamic belief.
> The comic explicitly refers to the public multiple times via "anyone else," "shows," "and "internet communities."
From an Auburn fan during 2013 and a Falcons fan during 2016, you are definitely right. Both times we were expected to lose, buth times we surprisingly took control, and both times we had victory slowly ripped away.\n\nThat is the worst possible feeling. Just being bad like last year or losing from the beginning is so much better than being *almost* good enough.
I had limited knowledge of the candidates before the debate, but Ellison had 2 obvious problems to me.\n\n(1. Muslim\n\nFair or not, this is the country we live in. The DNC chair position is about winning votes. Ellison's religion (and past associations) would instantly lose several supporters.\n\n(2. Poor speaker\n\nEven with his cold or whatever Perez (as well as Green and Mayor Pete) were significantly better speakers. Ellison was constantly stumbling over his words. The left needs someone like Priebus who was able to consistently jump in front of a camera and rally the troops to whatever cause.\n\nAside from that, they really had negligible differences on policy. Really it seemed like the debate was just everyone trying to outagree with each other. The proxy Clinton v. Bernie nonsense was a waste of time. I'm glad that the two men it centered around had the forethought to head it off a bit.
The video is from an interview over a year ago. It just gained attention now because most people had no idea who he was before.
Are you arguing that ignorance is better than dishonesty?\n\nFrom a moral standpoint I'd agree, but that's setting up a pretty low bar.
What do you mean by "acceptable?" I'm not a Muslim so I don't accept the tenets of Islam I suppose.\n\nOr are you talking about accepting that Muslims exist in America? I'm a strong proponent of the constitution, so I don't think that politicians should be purging anyone based on religion.
> This is ridiculous. I would rather get blown away that bend over to a clear violation of my constitutional rights established under the 4th amendment .\n\nI'm sure your kids would prefer their dad be dead than inconvenienced by a corrupt system.
Personally I don't make jokes like that, but I can't speak for everyone else. Can't imagine how Melanie felt watching that. I think my wife would've been a bit more...responsive.
> that's why we all think fat is bad for us\n\nI think the main issue is that fats are called fats. Unfortunately they will always be tightly associated with poor health for that regardless of anything else changing.
You should watch the relevant portion and decide for yourself what happened instead of relying on someone else making claims about things there is direct evidence available for.
Do people hate him?\n\nI thought people just mocked him because he looks like a child.
> We seem to not be dead.\n\nYou seem fat as fuck, though.\n\nAnd I have to deal with treating your fat asses.\n\nHonestly it would save a lot of time and money if more would die off quickly instead of hanging around leaching resources.
12 * 6 = 72\n\n72 < 80\n\nAll clear!
Is September not early as hell for Step 2? Am I missing something here?
This is what leads to things like the individual mandates.
Can a fact be biased?
This was 2 years ago.\n\nIf anyone on Fox attacked him like that now, they'd be fired before the segment ended.
Better than a ham-filled fatass.
To be fair, they only had about 6 years.\n\nWho could possibly think of anything that quickly while under the crippling  oppression of Obamacare?
> Bernie's-base-is-only-white-bro-dudes lie\n\nDidn't minorities and women overwhelmingly vote for Clinton?\n\nRelative brodom is a bit more difficult to quantify, but I'd argue that it correlates inversely with age, and that would also fit Sanders' strongest supporters.
The one "showing the door" in this case is the president.\n\nThat comic is explicitly stating how the 1st ammendment applies to punitive government action (specifically penal), but not private sector.\n\nThat's pretty much the worst example to further your point in this situation.
> This is the exact same thing that they tried to do with the Trump "grab em by the pussy" tape. ...Trump wasn't advocating sexual assault.\n\nCould you explain your interpretation of the recording? To me it seemed like Trump was saying that he could get away with anything due to being famous, and pussy grabbing was used as an example of something that he could theoretically get away with.
Some people have just never had a date leave.\n\nI'm pretty sure people leaving mid-date is a pretty rare thing.
> What is even the use of having the subi so late?\n\nGraduation requirement probably.
> people will just go full meltdown all over again\n\nIn theory, if his approval goes up, then more of those people will be happy (leading to the improved polling) and have no reason to melt down.
> instead, smoking stayed relatively the same\n\nThis is false. [Smoking rates have consistently dropped](http://www.infoplease.com/ipa/A0762370.html).\n\nConsistent smoking taxes were applied around the 60s to 70s.
> following panels clarify if you say stupid things you'll suffer consequences\n\nThe comic explicitly refers to the public multiple times via "anyone else," "shows," "and "internet communities." You know this. This is not an ambiguous cartoon. I am not going to waste any more of my time explaining what you already know but are intentionally ignoring.
Why do people always try to rationalize dickishness?\n\nSome happy, well-adjusted people are *also* assholes. Assholery is not mutually exclusive with personal fulfilment.
So how do you differentiate?\n\nType 2 diabetes which is the one most often associated with obesity, has a significantly stronger level of heritability than insulin dependent Type 1. There are millions of people with healthy weights suffering from the same disease through no fault of their own.\n\nSo you have the option of limiting payments for the obese or whatever qualifier. Then you have to account for the countless other exception to fault.\n\nThat's also completely ignoring the fact that such a large number of Americans are fat and will likely oppose any such measures from the outset.
>  a society that rewards hard work and merit\n\nThe greatest reward to me is the long term security of my family.\n\nGiven that, such a society would reward my hard work with the security of my children.
In this most recent election, about 63 million people voted for Trump and about 66 million for Clinton.\n\nDo you honestly believe that 66 million+ Americans believe those things?
I completely disagree about HW. His voice/tone are pretty boring.
Like your link shows, older minorities voted overwhelmingly for Clinton (Nearly 80%).\n\nAlso, older people voted significantly more overall. Less than 18% of the voters were under 30.\n\nThose things combined accounted for Clinton's overwhelmingly stronger support with minorities.\n\n>  Politico reported that 82 percent of women under 30 voted for Sanders\n\nI'm going to assume you weren't trying to be *intentionally* misleading with that statement by leaving out the "In New Hampshire’s primary" specification. I've had a bit more difficulty finding gender stats for the primary overall.\n\n
M1 and M2 were easy.\n\nM3 is work.\n\nM4 is supposedly nice, but I imagine it sucks until you're done with all the stress.
When they redo the test like the MCAT.\n\nWell it won't end.\n\nIt'll just start over.
That huge mess of controlling two thirds of the government with a majority of state mansions and eyes on the final third.\n\n\nHonestly they're in shambles.
All of the major pollsters release their sampling methods.\n\nYou can personally verify that their samples are reasonable if you want.
I've had "Presidential Athletic Achievement Award" on my CV for years.
Clear example of how the Mississippis are inferior at corruption.\n\nFuckin noobs
> Jewish people in my area and the majority are conservative and vote consistently republican.\n\nYour area is atypical.\n\n> [For congressional and senate races, since 1968, American Jews have voted about 70%-80% for Democrats](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewish_views_and_involvement_in_US_politics)
> This is not an ambiguous cartoon. I am not going to waste any more of my time explaining what you already know but are intentionally ignoring.
Nah it's still *the* big show.\n\nRandoms like me who don't give a fuck know about is compared to all those other random ones people are posting prices for.
Well the people in /r/Conservative seemed said they were supporting Ellison.\n\nI expect Trump would've just put out some anti-Muslim tweet or something about Farrakhan if Ellison won.
I'm pretty sure they both knew exactly what was going to happen based on their interactions at the debate.
> That's it.\n\nDid you see Spicer's statement?
> There were multiple occasions when Obama did it. That said he did not use the official press briefings as a punitive action and instead hosted separate "private" ones, but the principle being violated is the same. If Trump's goal was to repeat the sins of Obama, he could have easily set up separate briefings with his chosen reporters and made less fuss.\n\n...\n\n> I explicitly mentioned how this was not penal action.
> paint Bernie supporters as stubborn\n\nThere are multiple examples of "If what I want doesn't happen they can burn" and "If what I want doesn't happen I'm leaving." How is it inaccurate to call that stubborn?
> A woman of 70 with breast cancer would have her operation cancelled, and the 40 year old would not.\n\nSurgeons make these decisions every day. I've personally seen it happen. The rationale is that the burden of surgery/other treatment is likely to lead to an overall lower quality of life relative to natural death expedited by cancer. Also no one wants their survival rate to take a hit, but we don't talk about that.
You might have disabled updates somehow. I have a Verizon G4 and haven't received any updates, but I vaguely remember doing something about that whenever root was released.
How many med schools did you attend?
> Adios "progressive" who somehow doesn't share the same viewpoints as this progressive, and myself a progressive.\n\nAre you saying that anyone who disagrees with you is not a progressive?
I'd rather my guys be incompetent than cowards.\n\nAnd that's come from an Auburn fan.
> I explicitly mentioned how this was not penal action.
They were talking about difficulty of matriculation not graduation.
The Russians said (translated)...\n> I cannot say that all of them, but quite a few have been staying in touch with Russian representatives.\n\nThe Trump team responded...\n\n>We are not aware of any campaign representatives that were in touch with any foreign entities before yesterday, when Mr. Trump spoke with many world leaders.\n\nNYT now says...\n\n> Phone records and intercepted calls show that members of Donald J. Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign and other Trump associates had repeated contacts with senior Russian intelligence officials in the year before the election ... The officials interviewed in recent weeks said that, so far, they had seen no evidence of such cooperation.\n\nThe claim is that the Trump team **lied**. Similarly to with Flynn, there is no explicit accusation of wrongdoing outside of lying. The only difference is that this would be lying to the American people instead of to VP Pence. Of course the wording there leaves them open to scapegoat whoever the team members were as acting alone.
> hope of taking back the house.\n\nThere isn't much hope of dems winning the house in 2018.\n\nThey need to flip about two thirds of the ~35 red seats that have any possibility of being lost while defending ALL of their ~20 losable seats.\n\nBarring some transcendent fuckup, I don't see that happening with how high Trump's support among red voters has been.\n\nSimilarly for the senate, they need to flip 3 of the possible 9 red seats while defending all of their 25 seats. Only 2 of the red seats have any real chance of flipping, while 6 blue seats are in serious dangerous.\n\nIt's actually a good bit more likely (but still pretty unlikely) that the red team gets to a super majority than the blue team even breaks even.
Isn't that good?\n\nThe NFL following the will of their customers is fantastic in my opinion.\n\nNow I just wish their customers would complain more about the NFL's billionaire owners taking taxpayer subsidies for their stadiums.
The answer is yes, that seemed pretty obvious.\n\nJust like when any murder happens, we don't go trying to make murder *more* illegal. You prosecute those responsible and move on instead of adding more ways for the government to interfere.
> This is part of the reason I think Atlanta will be OK.\n\nNah, we need to go full on Atl sports defeatist mode.\n\nThe sun will never rise again on our teams.
Jimmy Carter exists.
So no answer.
Your claim was that the poster you disagree with assumed that Trump "knew the truth."\n\nThe implication there is that he in fact did not know the truth.\n\nDo you disagree?
It gives him better pulling leverage and allows him to do the pat thing on top with his other hand.
Ah community organizing. I don't see what would be the impetus to get that kicked off, but it probably would serve to normalize relations a bit if you had Muhamed regularly satirized like you do with other religious figures.
That's skipping the random kissing part, but you do you man.\n\nIf openly disrespecting your own family in front of other people is cool with you, that's your prerogative.
The argument is that of taxes paid, the majority come from the rich.\n\nThe rich tend to pay a lower overall portion of their earnings, but their earnings are sufficiently high that their smaller portion outweighs the larger portion from the poor.
> SHIT battery life.\n\nHow does everyone have such varied experience with this? This phone has had the longest uptime by far for me. I have the Verizon version, though.
Technically no. There is a purging subtype of anorexia that notably overlaps with bulimia.\n\nThe primary discriminant is usually the patient's weight.
It's a dishonest trend.\n\nPeople just feel good about calling themselves independents. Then they go on to vote along party lines the vast majority of the time.
It depends on the terrorist.\n\nDylann Roof for example was a christian and a terrorist, but he was not a christian terrorist, because he was motivated by racism.\n\nNow Michael Griffin *was* a christian terrorist, because he was motivated to kill by his faith.
There isn't much hope of dems winning the house in 2018.\n\nThey need to flip about two thirds of the ~35 red seats that have any possibility of being lost while defending ALL of their ~20 losable seats.\n\nBarring some transcendent fuckup, I don't see that happening with how high Trump's support among red voters has been.\n\nSimilarly for the senate, they need to flip 3 of the possible 9 red seats while defending all of their 25 seats. Only 2 of the red seats have any real chance of flipping, while 6 blue seats are in serious dangerous.\n\nIt's actually a good bit more likely (but still pretty unlikely) that the red team gets to a super majority than the blue team even breaks even.
I feel like it would be good to add in all playoff teams for a better control. I assume *all* teams would just end up with +/-0.
What's Clinton's record with the LGBT community?
I believe people should be able to do all sorts of things without being violently attacked.\n\nConveniently, assault is illegal.\n\nLess conveniently, criminals often ignore the law.\n\nMaking more laws doesn't stop that.
What do you think about claims like his electoral college win being the largest since Reagan?\n\nWhen I see things like that, it seems to me like the president just says things that he thinks will be well received regardless of whether or not they are true. Do you disagree with that?\n\nThis is not meant to be insulting. I legitimately do not understand why statements like those don't bother people.

Yea. Fuck that shit.
If you're considering this gun, get it. My AUG is my favorite gun I have, and I have a lot of tasty guns. I've never met someone that doesn't like it.

Someone force this man to wear a coat!!
I know. I was being sarcastic. And agreeing with you.
He can just rub some dirt in it. That'll take care of everything
Because he's a fucking sprooter who always comes in here and steps on our nuts
Yea, it's important to do this after you've whined to the PD about staff being meanies to you. 
Why I always take a shit at work after I've clocked in. 
Mostly prepared. There were only maybe 10 questions total where it was a couple drugs I'd never heard of or some pathology I had no clue on. On those that you have absolutely no clue, you have to use process of elimination or deductive reasoning to infer answers. 
We need to start giving them to patients. They'll be the only ones left out soon. 
I'm still lost. I don't get what spraying against aphids and ensuring proper fertilization technique has to do with neuro.
What physician can't put food on the table because of their debt? Yea, it's a lot of money. But if you don't buy a $500,000 house and $150,000 car as soon as you're an attending, it shouldn't be that big of a deal to pay off loans.\n\n\nThe only reason this would matter is if you get halfway through school and then drop out.
Lawyer up. Hit the radiologist. Delete their studies. 
Can you load a 50 BMG into a .50 Desert Eagle? It works right?
Loreleidanes did not show much interest. Read more to increase your fund of knowledge.
Doesn't matter. More important stuff would be curriculum, if attendance is mandatory, how they average on Step, etc.
Give me a break, Step scores get you in the door, but there is a LOT more to getting into residencies of most specialties unless you want a shitty residency.
Yes. My only straight anatomy questions were over a common peroneal nerve, and popliteal artery question. I'd say muscle actions and what not are way way low yield

Hey guys I'm not gay, I play football. I accidentally clicked this thread because I thought my mouse was hovered over the hot girls thread. Well, since I'm here I had a question let's say hypothetically I had gay thoughts (lol yea right) and I found my close friend attractive (ew gross) and one day we had sex in the back of my car after football practice (I would puke...the only thing I bang is chicks with big tits you know what I'm saying lol) but we didn't kiss. Would that be gay? We were wasted and while we were banging we kept calling each other fags. It's almost like a parody of when we bang chicks (remember this didn't happen). So that wouldn't make me gay right? Just a jokester?
The general public pissing on people who are more successful and make more money than them is nothing new.
You came back with a Mickey Mouse ears souvineer hat?
At this point I don't understand how more of you guys haven't heard about how the language at the time would be interpreted today. The SC has explained that well regulated does not mean that the government regulates it - at the time, well regulated meant that it was in working order (and some argue, it meant "adequate"). 
Funny story. Brother got a 20 gauge for Christmas. Said 20 on the box and everything. So we go out, I load a 20 into the bottom and it gets stuck on the feed ramp. We're talking stuck stuck. I had to disassemble the gun to get it out. So I hand load the round in and "click." Nothing happens. I pull out the round and there's no strike on the primer... ok, so I try it again. I hear a "THOOMP" noise as the wad shoots about 3 feet out and the shot rolls out the end of the barrel. At this point I realize what the fucks going on, look at the barrel, and it's marked 12 gauge. The fucking gun was sold as a 20 gauge in the receipt, came in a 20 gauge box, but was actually a 12. We were lucky nothing worse than the thoomp happened. 
I heard that was if you grabbed and placed the PDs hand on your dick when he reaches for a handshake 
Smoke a fat one for me pal, I'll be fightin the good fight
Yea, well, half the OB people I hated were guys. So maybe you're projecting.

Then your test center did it differently than mine as well. My break time added up if I finished early.

Why are you bringing Tanzania into this??
I kept my head above water with classes and did well but not fantastic and didn't start studying for Step until spring break and got upper 250s... So I'd say yea.
I took mine 4 and 3 weeks out, and had UWSA 1 at 5 and UWSA 2 at 2 weeks out. Careful as you get closer and closer, these tests can teach you stuff but they mainly serve as a gauge - I did alright on all of them except UWSA 2 at two weeks where I scored 20 points less than my actual score - that was all good and well after I'd received my official, but in the two weeks leading up to Step it freaked me the fuck out because it indicated I wasn't going to do as well as I wanted and added some serious stress leading up to the test. 
I know, everyone knows that if you want to knock someone down you don't insult them, you insult their loved ones. Amateur. 
Wow this blew up rip in peace my outbox thnx for the gold omg my first thank you so much
The next month is torture too as you wait around for your score. Don't worry though, if it doesn't kick your butt mentally you didn't do it right. Fingers crossed for ya 🤞
Up until this year, pestana's was enough. This year everyone is getting fucked with a traffic cone on the shelf. i haven't found anyone that said it wasn't that bad - every unanimously has said it was rough.
Do it. Especially if you want a competitive specialty, odds are once you start, youre going to have potentially a 9-year stretch of going through the ringer. I wish I had had a year without school.
I mean, as an unofficial answer yes. But from a PR standpoint.... I don't imagine LCME could ever let that fly in an "official" sense of things.
I mean, it depends on your definition of bonkers. 
Yea. I filled it out and found some Hispanic guys name from Alexandria to put down , heh.
Ok, I guess I've found one person who didn't think it was rough.

No. You get nothing. May be able to work a little during first or second year and you'll get all of it back, but you won't make enough to make much of a difference. 
It's not uncommon... my dad is a CV CRNA and makes almost $250k along with the other 2 that are there. They've all been doing it for 20 or 25+ years, but still, it's a pretty decent amount.

What an amazing time to be alive 
Be frugal to the extent that you can, but don't suffer because of it. You're already going to be miserable and under a giant pile of debt, might as well live somewhat comfortable. I'd rather pay a little more at the end and be happy during school than be miserable in school and owe a little less at the end. 
"I wish I could take that one complaining physician and have them work in something they "think" has a better life style. I doubt they'll last a week."\n\n\nUm yea... try working a 100-hour work week multiple times throughout 5 years. Give me a break. Maybe the people who actually go through it are just stupid and don't understand the issue like you. Or maybe you should get off your high horse. I understand what you're trying to say, because I share some of the sentiment and am surrounded by people who bitch about stuff all day they shouldn't, but it's not your place to criticize some things you don't understand simply because you haven't been through it yet.

slow claps steps out of the shadows Heh... not bad, kid. Not bad at all. Your meme, I mean. It's not bad. A good first attempt. It's plenty dank... I can tell it's got some thought behind it... lots of quotable material... But memeing isn't all sunshine and rainbows, kid. You're skilled... that much I can tell. But do you have what it takes to be a Memester? To join those esteemed meme ranks? To call yourself a member of the Ruseman's Corps? Memeing takes talent, that much is true. But more than that it takes heart. The world-class Memesters - I mean the big guys, like Johnny Hammersticks and Billy Kuahana - they're out there day and night, burning the midnight meme-oil, working tirelessly to craft that next big meme. And you know what, kid? 99 times out of a hundred, that new meme fails. Someone dismisses it as bait, or says it's "tryhard," or ignores it as they copy/paste the latest shitpost copypasta dreamt up by those sorry excuses for cut-rate memers over at reddit. The Meme Game is rough, kid, and I don't just mean the one you just lost :). It's a rough business, and for every artisan meme you craft in your meme bakery, some cocksucker at 9gag has a picture of a duck or some shit that a million different Johnny No-Names will attach a milion different captions to. Chin up, kid. Don't get all mopey on me. You've got skill. You've got talent. You just need to show your drive. See you on the boards...

OB - I'm at the foot of the bed as this woman is pushing. She makes her last push and she starts shitting. She's yelling in pain. The baby comes out screaming. The placenta smells like a wet mustelid. Her dilated vagina is bleeding profusely as clots fall into the bag. I can handle one or two of these things pretty easily, but the shotgun blast of all these things at once was just too much. The last day I was in L&D was probably the best day of medical school. 
At least it'll have the Falcons... I couldn't have imagined a more milquetoast superbowl than the Packers and the Patriots
Sometimes I like to think I'm more an independent. But seeing most of those questions and them essentially trying to force me every time to check one thing on the whole list that I am totally opposed to makes me realize yea, I'm definitely more on the right than the left in most ways.
Wasn't for me. Did way better on Step than MCAT, but I also didn't study everyday all day for 6 weeks straight for the MCAT.
I didn't really take it as an insult...

Everybody has a right to be offended, christians over gay marriage, liberals over guns, muslims over... everything.  Its just that "this offends me" is a worthless expression that should not be taken seriously.
First, why wouldn't a marriage contract make sense to a homosexual couple? \n\nSecond,  the insistance on calling it a civil union seems like a not so hidden effort to make the legal marriage of a gay couple seem inferior.  It's not so different from the arguments that tried to prevent interracial marriages.
The way I see it is that both sides have a checklist of what is a true conservative or a true liberal.  I would say that the majority cannot check every box on either list.  Not everyone who leans right is against gay marriage yet most republican candidates right now seem to have to come out against it.\n\n  On the other side, some liberals are proud gun owners yet it seems that most democratic candidates seem to have to come out and support some sort of gun control.\n\n\nThese are simple examples but in both cases, it seems that finding middle ground or being in favor of something from the other side is the death of a political career.\n\nYou cannot expect to successfully run a country when policies can only come from the far sides of the ideology bell curve.
Political correctness is simply civility to avoid conflict within society.  There is a difference between calling out something that is wrong and/or harmful to others and simply being offensive because you don't like someone or something.
Which almost everyone ignores because its not in the app version of Fb and even on the desktop version, they are not relevant to most users.  The company can have and promote a liberal stance, but regular users can customize their feed to avoid this.  
I would be fine with this as long as an atheist, or at the very least, an agnostic teaches the course.
Those are not strawman arguments, your view of marriage is too narrow.  \n\nAccording to you, people who meet as seniors or a couple that does not wish to have children would not need to be married, but what about protections in case of divorce, decisions in case of sickness, tax breaks etc.\n\nThese are things married couples have access to right now, straight or gay, regardless of children.\n\n  You might say that some of these can be solved with contracts or power of attorney, but that forces some people to unnecessarily jump through hoops to have the same benefits and protections that the majority has.\n\nAnd again, the absolute majority of claims that government should get out of the marriage business are only made when people are arguing against gay marriage.\n\n

Free Market!  \n\nI would say that if you already have the service, see if there are enough options that you like to offset what you don't like. If not, cut the service or don't subscribe.  Your money, your choice.\n\nEdit: I describe myself as fiscally conservative but socially liberal.  I am very pro marriage equality but really like chick-fil-a.  Taste wins.
This is correct, customers will end up paying more.  The same thing would happen with Trump's tariffs on imports.
Two heterosexual consenting adults have the right to marry each other and have benefits and protections under the law.  Adult homosexual consenting couples did not, they now have equal rights.  Those would be taken away.  
Mexico does a pretty good job of stopping central americans but a few will always get by, wall or no wall.  As long as the U.S is hiring, many will risk their lives to make it up there.  You want to stop it, stop hiring illegals, no wall is necessary.

So... deny equal rights to group A so that unrelated group B does not get uppity.\n\nWould you accept that using the slippery slope argument is wrong when it is being used against gun rights?\n\nThe original post refers to children playing and learning together in a safe environment.  You are railing against girls that want to go camping.  Even if you think they are just confused, allowing them to participate hurts no one and would probably help to teach empathy to everyone involved.\n\nAlso, girls are already allowed in the scouts, they make up around 25% of the members of the organization.

Although i am not Venezuelan, I do have friends who were able to leave before Chavez or during his first years.  I agree that anyone who supported this regime deserves it.  This opposition does in fact deserve refugee status anywhere safe.
How do you apply this to the US? Are you implying that you'll fence of muslims and only let them out through checkpoints?
No disrespect intended but this is a perfect example of a slippery slope logical fallacy.\n\nhttps://yourlogicalfallacyis.com/slippery-slope
To be fair, it would only be like forcing a Jewish bakery to bake a Nazi cake if they already baked KKK cakes.
Scruffy Looking Nerf Herder:  A Star Wars Story.\n\nYou got your title right there...
A meme with a stupid premise followed by a grammatically incorrect tweet.  You should do better than this, the law is on your side and promoting this makes you look bad.
In an ideal world, every child gets to grow up in a healthy happy home with two loving parents. We do not live in an ideal world.\n\nIt is not up to you or the government to decide what makes a healthy happy home by handing out blanket judgements on the individual characters and personalities of of couples based on their sexual orientation or wether they can have children or not.  \n\nEverybody has the same right to form a family with the same rights and protections under the law.  Happiness does not come in a mold that fits everyone.
Not in any order of importance.  It is still much better than any of the prequels\n\n1.  More ewok casualties should have been shown.\n\n2.  The use of coyote/acme tricks to easily destroy at-sts was just sad.\n\n3.  Why would they try to rescue Han by themselves when they have an army to back them up.  If they where important enough to lead the attack on Endor, the rebel alliance could have easily overwhelmed Jabba's forces and gotten him back.\n\n4.  The time frame in Endor just drags on and they seem to be in no rush at all compared to the fleet attack on the death star.\n\n5.  The Threepio is a god bit was also pretty bad.\n\n
It's also hypocritical to say that it is justified when its rape or incest but not for any other reason.  If that is your belief, why does it cease to be murder when the father is a rapist?\nTo be clear, I am a parent who is also pro choice in any situation.
The number of us border patrol agents stands around 20,000, to make it proportional to Israel it would have to be more than 300,000. Even by reducing it due to deserts, it still needs to be more than 10 times what it is now.
Using your example, the sixteen year old can wait and marry anyway.  You are not giving that option to gay couples.  
He is two. The tetracycline is an ointment, don't know if that will affect his teeth.
As you said, is it not in the interest of the government and society as a whole to promote the formation of nuclear families other than the traditional Mom, Dad, and biological children?
Lesbian couples can and do have children.  Heterosexual step-parents can legally adopt step-children.  Infertile couples can adopt children.  Are these not examples of nuclear families?\nI have also never heard of any movement trying to get government out of heterosexual marriage. It only seems to come up when arguing against gay marriage.
You do realize that both are jerks right? I think that the picture of the pants is worse but there is no epic lesson here.
A friend and her family were due to fly back to the states from that airport a few hours after the attack happened.  Luckily they had not arrived yet.  I also have to say that Facebook's "I'm safe" feature is excellent.
Doctor told us to wait it out because he would have to be put under for the procedure but if it doesn't get better we might not have a choice.
The title specifically says suicide bombers, so my question comes from there.  The wall or fence on the US southern border cannot be analogous to the one in israel because it cannot be guarded in the same manner.  Illegal immigrants from Mexico and Latin America cross over because there are jobs to be had.  If those jobs are not cut off, the wall or fence will just be an inconvenience to them.
I am seeing a lot of people around here say the same thing because they want a true conservative, yet they would vote for the libertarian party which is very liberal in social issues (Gay Marriage) and also support open immigration for workers.  
I see a blue helmet in your box so you are probably right, it just didn't survive.
Also, the video is very specific, it is talking about terrorist threats against Israel. It seems that you did not bother to watch it and just went off on a tangent after reading the word fence.
Musicians sign contracts with promoters who then sell tickets to the general public.  They are not refusing to perform to a particular group of people, they are just not performing in a whole state.  Artists will usually have clauses in these contracts that allow them to cancel or postpone concerts.  While I think that both the bakers and these artists are wrong, the situation is not remotely the same
Well, just don't go see it.  Isn't it the way free market works?  Besides, he stopped being funny a while ago. He actually released two versions of Anchorman 2 and both were equally awful.
Pedophilia is a horrible crime against children, preventing it is protection, not discrimination.\n\nUgly people can and do get married.\n\nPeople that can't have children can and do adopt.\n\nLaws that prevent a particular person or persons from doing something is usually done to prevent harm to others, although I agree that a lot of these laws are overarching.\n\nTwo consenting adults getting married does not cause any harm. It only solidifies a family.
43 male, I've mostly noticed envy ;)
Your facebook feed comes from your list of friends.  You have to go out of your way to get to the trending news stories and even if they appear as promoted posts, they can be easily dismissed.  Also, getting your news from FB is not the smartest choice anyone can make.  Complaining about this is like asking why Rush and Foxnews don't have anything with a liberal slant.
Your sticker idea might work in larger cities where consumers can find alternative businesses to buy from.  \nWhat would you do in small towns where people might be literally driven out by being denied basic necessities?
The border between Israel and Gaza and the West Bank is less than 30 miles.  It is heavily guarded by soldiers and electronic sensors.  It seems that you are being ridiculously dense if you think it is analogous to the proposed great wall of trump.  The resources needed to guard it in a similar manner would cause more debt than any previous administration.
But the pro life position is that it is a baby, so in the case of rape, you are saying that it is ok to kill it because half of its chromosomes come from a rapist but it is not ok if it comes from the offensive line of the state champions.\n\nBe pro-life or pro-choice, but stay off the fence.
I wasn't aware that gay people couldn't vote before.
If you are using a sports analogy, it could also be like saying that one team scores 5 runs, the other scores 4 but the final result is 9-0.\nHow about spliting the electoral votes proportionally?\nWould it help disenfranchised voters in solid red or blue states that feel like their vote for president never really counts?
Your name is Cameron and you actually stuck a lump of coal up your *** 'till it became a diamond.\n\nFerris Bueller reference for the downvotes that didn't get it.
I am sorry that I expressed myself poorly, my bad. I meant businesses that serve the general public.  I do not think that national chains would ever deny service because of the negative exposure they would get.  The problem I see with laws that allow refusal of service due to religious beliefs is that it would allow legal discrimination in places where the majority is likely to support such beliefs.  Like I said before, if the majority is bigoted, the market is bigoted.  It would be legal for small businesses in small conservative towns to place signs that say: We don't serve gays.
That's gonna need some kragle!
So you are saying that trans people are not the problem yet this law specifically targets them in order to stop a recently percieved threat from an unrelated group that may or not exist.  Real trans people have been using the bathroom of their choice for decades, there have been zero issues.\n\nThis is like saying that gun control laws should affect law abiding citizens because maniacs could perpetrate more mass shootings even though there really are no issues with responsible gun owners.
I apologize, what I said is an exaggeration.  Although I still think that a public business should cater to all the public.  
Jokes are meant to be funny, this just stupid. Try again.
So what are your thoughts on the RNC convention being a gun free zone?\n\nI understand it's a secret service decision.
The Israel fence is less that 30 miles, it is heavily guarded and monitored.  The proposed wall or fence with Mexico cannot be maintained in the same manner.  Plus, the video is talking about suicide bombers, hence my second question
As long as there is massive consumption in the U.S., the cartels will find a way, and if the wall does stop them, millions of Americans would break down the wall themselves to get more cocaine.
I got cought up, felt rather foolish when I saw the names. Again, I apologize
A) you are still denying equal rights to adult couples that want to get married.  If you want to use polygamy as an excuse to stop gay marriage,  heterosexual marriage is more closely linked to poligamy, maybe you should oppose that too.\n\nB) the original comment uses a slippery slope argument against girls in the boy scouts.  If you say that the argument is valid, I asume that you are also against girls in the boy scouts.  If you are not, I apologize.\n\nC)  I apologize for the mistake, I was thinking of international scout organizations that do allow girls and boys together.
No, you are saying that marriage is a mere contract of convenience.  The basis for a marriage is understood to come from love and attraction.  Saying that homosexuals had the right to marry someone of the opposite sex goes against what marriages are supposed to stand for.
Please stop obfuscating.  You tried to use the argument that gays had the right to marry a person of the opposite sex, therefore they had equal rights.  I said that everyone should have the right to marry whomever they love as long that both are single consenting adults.\n\nEdit: replied to the wrong person, sorry
I would say that the far left is as miserable as the far right.  Both sides have lost the ability to be empathic and undestanding with anyone who does not share the same views.  Both have deluded themselves into thinking that finding common ground is the worst thing anyone on their side can do
If they do exist, can you cite an example of this magnitude?
To expand on that thought, would leaving a bag of flaming dog crap and ringing the bell also be considered a hate crime? \n
So he wants states to have the power to take away the individual rights of a small part of their population.  Discrimination by popular vote.  I find his flat tax proposal interesting but it seems that he is fighting a battle that should have never been fought.
I understand you might have issues with gender, but can you cite an example of trans-aged men trying to get accepted into organizations meant for minors?\n\nAt the end of the day, this is no different from activities that take place every year in summer camps all over.
This... :D
I would understand if they would go with the pure libertarian position that a business should have the right to refuse service for whatever reason and leave it at that.\n\nCiting their religious beliefs to refuse service in a gay wedding and to have no problem with a gay birthday does not make sense.  The Bible says nothing of gay weddings, it is against homosexuality as a whole.  This is why it seems to me that the whole religious exception is a hypocritical excuse.
That sounds great but please take into account that special needs and behavioral issue students require teachers with a higher education/experience level and a low student to teacher ratio.  It could be a niche market but it will definitely be more expensive than a regular school
I'd be very surprised if you could prove that a donkey or a roller coaster could give consent to a legal marriage.  Please use logical arguments, this is why your position is taken less seriously every day.\n\nMarriage is understood to be between two single consenting adults.\n\n\nFunny that people that oppose it were perfectly happy with the federal government's position  before gay marriage became a possibility.\n\n
One can dislike and even hate, but that does not mean that you get to pick and choose the legal rights of others
1-Age of consent laws exist for a reason, I don't  understand why this can be seen as discrimination.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n2-There are ugly gay people too. This has absolutely no relation to having the choice and right to marry if you happen to find someone you love and loves you back.  The law is not preventing or making it more difficult for an ugly person from marrying.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n3-True, but the option is still there.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n4-Filing your taxes is an obligation, it should be equal for everyone.  I agree that forcing only some of the population to file and pay taxes would be discrimination against them.  On the other hand, giving tax breaks to some and not to others is also wrong.  I like the flat tax idea but with no deductions, equal to all citizens.\n\n&nbsp; \n\n5-The percentage does not matter.  Equal rights should never depend on the majority being offended.  If only one gay couple wants to have the same rights as all straight couples, no law should prevent it.  Btw, if the "contemporaries" remark was meant to disparage me, Ted Cruz is my contemporary\n
This is a person having a mental breakdown due to stress or other unknown reasons.  Does this belong here?
You would only be correct if the Jewish bakers made cakes for other hate groups like the KKK or the WBC.  The actual hipocricy is that they have no problem baking cakes for previously divorced couples, single mothers, non-Christians etc.
Agree, a maximum security penitentiary in the U.S. is probably a resort next to a Russian mental ward.
I live in Guatemala, Mexico's southern neighbor, there is no wall in our border and there is also no wall between the Dominican Republic and Haiti.  Hungary had a fence, it no longer does.

Horrible situation but simple question:  does a woman have the right to smoke and drink heavily during her pregnancy?

I actually tried to read the article, must say it is pretty awful.  As an atheist, I have to say that it reads more like a muslim apologist pretending to be a christian.  It is a very childish idea to say that a religion has to change its fundamental dogma in order to apeace another violent religion
This is all fine and good in places that are more accepting of LGBT and minorities.  The problem with allowing public businesses to refuse service whenever they want is that there will be places where discrimination will become acceptable.  If the majority is bigoted, the market is also bigoted; it will not self correct as you say.
The truth is that the wall might slow down illegal immigration but it wont stop it.  It will only become a huge blemish on the U.S. the same way that the Berlin Wall was on East Germany.  \n\nThe dangling carrot is too tasty.  As long as there are Americans hiring illegals, poor peasants from Mexico and Central America will be willing to pay coyotes more than a year's wages to cross into the U.S.\n\nAs long as they are allowed, Americans will continue to hire them for a fraction of what they would legally have to pay.  You want to stop it, cut off the jobs.  Hire Americans to mow your lawns, clean your houses, pick your crops, and learn how to make good tacos.\n\nAs for the drug traffic, as long as Americans keep snorting mountains of cocaine each year, Cartels will find ways of transporting it into the country.  Not to mention the Banks that subsist by laundering their money.

I think the pain is preventing him from really going at it.  I do think he will eventually pop it, the cone of shame would come in handy then.
For example, a proportional split would have made the 2012 results closer.  The motivation that votes count even in solid states could have tipped the balance.

Looks like it but no.  He seems to be ok most of the time but once in a while he rubs it with his knuckles.
No, it would be comparable if you are saying that 16 year old homosexuals had to wait.  Btw, they would only have to wait in 17 states and in Texas, not at all.  Why are so obsessed with discriminating against gay couples because there are other types of discrimination?  Shouldn't  you be in favor of individual freedom?
And what reason would the state have to deny an adult consenting homosexual couple from entering into a contract that any adult consenting heterosexual couple can?
So according to you, the right to marry, vote, own a gun etc. should depend on the majority of a state's legislature and therefore, open to change every election cycle.\n\nRights exist so that a majority cannot oppress a minority.
So it may well be government overreach, just not because of religion.  Thanks for the info.
Everything that is known of this case comes from the family since the government cannot divulge anything when minors are involved.  All the children were placed in foster care while the case is ongoing because of suspicion of physical abuse especially against the older girls.  The parent's religion is in no way mentioned as the reason for the accusation, this has only been brought up by them.  You should wait for the case to be over for more information to be released in order to judge if it is really about their religion and government overreach.
Honest question, how is the NC bathroom law going to be enforced?  \n\nDoes it become a crime when a woman goes into the men's room when the women's bathroom is too crowded (common occurence in bars and live events).  \n\nWill there be a problem when a mother takes her son to a women's bathroom?  Would there be a cutoff age in this situation?\n\nEdit: just saw that it doesn't  apply to private businesses.  Question answered.
So, the tradition argument.  While traditionally marriage has been between a man and a woman, it has also had many variations that would not be acceptable today. \n\n Most people also lived under kings and lords with little or no say on the laws that affected them.  Should this tradition be kept also?   \n\nMost marriages include the phrase, "Till death do us part", yet there are specific laws regarding divorce.  The definition of marriage has been changing for centuries, why should it stop now\n\n\nThere are thousands of gay couples that have build their lives together for decades.  Their unions are the same as any traditional marriage, the only thing that changed was their legal status.  Too bad of you don't like it.\n
Good to know, thanks!
Unnecessary procedure but it seems that both sides are greatly exaggerating the pros and cons.  After reading several posts about it in different subs, it seems like a lot of reddit users' atittudes against it are becoming very similar to anti-vaxxers while those in favor don't seem to care much.  
Conservative is not the correct word, per say, but "far-right" is accurate. I'm not a fan of trying to categorize political leanings, as it gets overly complicated.
I remember when people found out about this and threw a fit. It's hilarious really, since it means absolutely nothing.

Hey, in whatever fashion people choose to believe in bizarre fantasies is fine by me.

Hatched Pokemon will always (it seems) be at least 80%. I've never caught a 100% mon, but I've hatched 2 of them (Magnemite and Squirtle). I have caught and hatched some that are 95%+, but to get better IV's, it looks to me like hatching is the sure way to go. \n\nAs far as evolving and investing dust and candy, I usually only go for those who are 80% and above.
What I hear every time someone posts that regionals need to pop up in events is, "I play this game, and just because I play, I'm entitled to what I want. I don't want people's Pokémon collections to be unique. I want everyone to be the same. If I complain loud enough, I'll get what I want."

I live on a ranch now in Texas. Yes, it seriously does take that long for anyone wondering. \n\nFact is, it's better to deal with dangerous situations yourself rather than waiting for a cop. Somehow that just makes sense.  
It is their liberty to do so.  They are under no moral obligation to pursue martial justice in this world.\n\nJuly 18, 1775.  The Continental Congress passes a resolution regarding the military service of Quakers et al containing the following excerpt:  \n\n*As there are some people, who, from religious principles, cannot bear arms in any case, this Congress intend no violence to their consciences, but earnestly recommend it to them, to contribute liberally in this time of universal calamity, to the relief of their distressed brethren in the several colonies, and to do all other services to their oppressed Country, which they can consistently with their religious principles.*\n\nMadison sought to enshrine a very similar principle in the 2nd amendment, although it was not supported by the rest of the assembly.  
What is the wage gap between the 76 genders?
I'm am very pro second amendment but I also don't believe in forcing ownership of firearms. I do believe the when seconds count the police are only minutes away. Id much rather trust the 45acp moving at 950 ft/s! At 20 feet thats a response time of 0.00005 seconds!
It's a balancing game. Having a gun in the home is a major risk factor for suicide, accidental injury to adults and kids. I choose to not have a gun in my home for those reasons and feel reasonably safe enough where I live in a major metropolitan area that I wouldn't need to use one for self defense. Others may feel differently. Claiming people aren't taking responsibility for their safety by not having guns is an inflammatory statement meant to argue, not help people make decisions or provide information. 
I lived on a ranch growing up. If someone came to steal or kill, it would be at least two hours before the cops could show up. \n\nYeah, I like my right to bear arms.
Washington DC had a promising system until it was mercilessly crushed.
The duties of regulatory enforcement and monitoring are already largely left up to the states' departments of environmental quality (DEQs).  \n\nI suppose the more traditional role of the EPA is to oversee interstate matters, like coordinating policy throughout a drainage basin.  For example, it would make sense for Louisiana fishermen to seek redress against Illinois cattlemen via that agency as well as the federal courts.

Perhaps something where attention to detail is more important than productivity.

I always thought it was neat that Japan has tens of thousands of shrines for sacred places, mostly managed by local committees called Ujiko.
It's probably best if the states or even the municipalities take the lead role in reviewing charters and setting targets.  Figuring out education issues shouldn't require a body intended for regulating interstate commerce.

That they can even sort of grasp that an inanimate object is its own thing and that it has some sort of function or relationship to other things is impressive by itself.\n\nWhat really surprises me is when even invertebrates can manage to demonstrate something similar.

The digestion process to put the metals into solution probably results in copious amounts of effluent waste.  Hopefully they can reuse it a couple of times, but ultimately it is going to be discharged into waterways.  \n\nI would hope there would be a oven process whereby the waste could be heated sequentially to different temperatures, preferably in a continuous process, where a different substance is melted at each step. \n\nIn the meantime, we need to figure out circuit board designs that have end of life designed into them, ie closed loop manufacturing practices.

The trouble is that the grandly gnostic world shaping ideologies always founder on the shoals of reality and its manifold paradoxes.  There is no substantive ideology that applies to biology or geology.\n\nVery simply, political philosophies work best in the civil sphere, an invented space that exists between people.  A political philosophy like classical liberalism should concern mainly ordinating and establishing boundaries on the interactions between people.\n\nProperty is simply something that contains some element of a person's labor.  It's self-limiting, and concerns the person and his labor more than the something.    No one can imbue their labor into the ocean.  No political philosophy is ever involved in justifying anyone participating in the largely self-regulating, self-managing phenomenon of something as vast and complex as a biosphere.  \n\nA fence is not what establishes the boundary between the commons and the anti-commons.  
Our vision is not based on instruments that accord neatly with the visible range of spectrum.

So, a bit of both white and green to produce light green.\n\nPink relies on blue and red, which are on opposite sides of the spectrum.  No green activation signals are required, even though the average of the two would seem to place it closer to green.  Pink is not a red signal diluted by white light, which would just be a lighter shade of red.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Additive_color

Such things always occur in a state of dynamic equilibrium.  The number of students attending charters is in the single digit percentages, so there has to be some incentive to expand the program over time.\n\nUltimately, it's a mistake to assume that if cost per student is kept artificially high, then they are seeing greater benefit.  
Often, I wonder if the only practical solution is the sort that would be penned by a modern day Jonathan Swift.  If we accept the premise that meth or heroin users accept that what they are doing is killing themselves, then is it so morally dubious to speed the process along incrementally so long as we are above board in doing it?\n\nFollowing public approval for the program by referenda, suppose we interdicted some percentage of meth/heroin production, 10-20% maybe, or even manufactured it in a lab.  The product is then adulterated with subclinical amounts of arsenic, or another bio-accumulative toxin.  The product is then supplied to compromised low-level dealers.  They don't know that it is for sure adulterated as there is only a percent chance.  Likewise, the users also don't know for sure, but they assume the risk.  Over time, the toxin accumulates in chronic users, thereby accelerating their deterioration and eventual demise.
Interesting.  Would we use different formulae for torsional shear vs linear shear?
UBI is an engineered dystopia, designed as a response to another engineered dystopia.  It's not designed to counter the latter, but to sustain it.\n\nPeople should be looking at how technology changes expectations.  It doesn't just move the pieces around the board.  Rather, it changes how we think about the pieces and the game.\n\nOne example of what we should be doing with technology is personal assistants.  If it's not already here, the task of helping a person find a role in society, once known as a "job search," is a perfect sort of task for a soft AI.  Data is a new kind of commodity that can be stored and even multiplied endlessly at minimal cost in resources.  It's a cornucopia of strange fruit. 
I wish weapon tiers had bigger tracking gaps between them.  That would loosen up everything so we could have fits that were good at engaging specific classes.  (A ship using an MWD is temporarily one class up.)   Some weapon groups only have two tiers instead of three, but that's actually ok.  \n\nWe need BS that can be specialized to make *all* cruisers miserable, and BC that can routinely compete with the effective ranges of any cruiser doctrine if they surrender effective anti-frigate capabilities.\n\nI also wouldn't mind complicating the tracking formulas to make hitting small targets at range less reliable.  That would complicate the hell out of a lot of boring fleet comp meta.  If we're horse trading, then let's have damage at range be comparable with middle or even short range weapons against appropriate size targets.
Maxing out the buffer on a DST produces some absurd numbers on defence.  However, that is all made irrelevant when you realize that you align only slightly more quickly than a freighter.
I will, thanks.
If there were some way to curtail self-inflicted unwellness, or lifestyle disorders, we probably could easily afford to treat most people and not have too many political hangups about doing so.  \n\nFor example, the population most inclined to smoke are people below the poverty line, and those with low educational attainment.  In general, the public is reluctant to expend resources on such groups.  They would regard it as throwing good money after bad. 
It would only require a very small increase in diameter to make it much more difficult to shear off a bolt.
Even if it were true that they are "left behind," they were never going to see some benefit from holding back those who would become high achievers.  All that does is make the whole country less competitive.  \n\nCountries like China are leaving us in the dust.  We can't afford to fall behind any faster.
Basically, subreddits generally allow the community to moderate discussions via voting.  There are no downvotes on KSH forums, and only non-participatory moderation.   It's the same for forums dedicated to any product hosted by the manufacturers of that product.
[We are seeing the poor performers have their charters revoked](http://www.nola.com/education/index.ssf/2016/12/charter_decisions_2016.html). \n\nThe key to a successful charter expansion is to have responsible regulatory processes in places, as well as a growing number of options available to stakeholders.  If we do nothing, then we simply accept the public school to prison pipeline.
That's straying close to alternative facts territory.   There is always some scarcity in health services.  It cannot be avoided.\n\n
I think they inverted the Flesch readability index.
T1 need to be generalists, especially battleships.  It serves no purpose to make them intentionally be inferior.\n\nIt would be worthwhile to elaborate upon the build requirements of all tech 1 ships to include more categories of materials beyond asteroid materials.  If this trend became more pronounced with heavier classes of ships, we would no longer think about tech 1 the way we do now.  Insurance would also be reduced as a design consideration.
*"Let’s get the simple things out of the way first. Crucially, Crowfall will not feature a global, NPC operated auction house such as the type usually employed by themepark MMOs. Instead, the design objective is for players to build and run their own shops and trade hubs in the open world, which is absolutely crucial for crafters to really be able to make a name for themselves. After all, no matter how good the crafting itself is, the individuals never really stand out if all their goods are coming from the same storefront."*\n\nI've often felt this was a problem in EVE as well.  You can't make a name for yourself in Jita, at least not as an industrialist.  There's a style of gameplay that perhaps doesn't appeal widely.  Personally, I'd like to be required to operate or rent a warehouse for goods and ships.  I like to see mechanics that allow industrialists to muscle out the competition, or which incentivize producers to cover more territory.  It's cool if the next step in potentially reducing costs is to own your own station, lease out space in it, and bribe pirates to make more trouble in the territory of your competition than in your own.
I've encountered this a few times.  If you're patient, just do an EVA and reconfigure components into an hydrogen thruster. \n\nAlternately, post your coordinates in chat and see who shows up.
I've been trying to think of ways to do dual use or double up on functions in order to make more conservative craft.  For example, make an SV/HV garage that is also a farm plot.
Silicon has covalent bonds, so it more strongly resists attack by acids  than do typical metal to metal bonds.  It also has an higher melting point for the same reason.
Well, you really want a better carbon to nitrogen ratio, otherwise it will trigger leaching of nitrates.  Herbivore spoor is usually ok because it already has lots of indigestible plant fiber.  It's a waste not to use it to accelerate high carbon compost though.
A battleship that's good against cruisers should be one that's fit for the task, and frankly sub-par against other battleships.\n\nBattlecruisers should have the default range to counter the typical cruiser fleet meta.  They're slow, and critically, they've got 250m signatures.
How many hectares of plants are you looking to manage through the growing season?
If it were up to me, I'd charge insurers and hospital administrators under the RICO acts for collusion and racketeering.  Hospitals should be forced to publish general pricing guidelines rather than supply different prices to different categories of customers.  Admittedly, it is a complex proposition, but no more complex than what many other businesses face and no more complex than what they are already doing.\n\nIdeally, we should restructure what insurance means, with the goal of making it attractive to people who would otherwise file bankruptcy or otherwise cause what are basically unsecured loans to be written off.  If I had 20k in assets to my name, I probably only want about 20k in coverage.  That's all I would have to worry about, because after that my treatment is someone else's problem.  Likewise with deductibles, the logic of the incrementation process is pernicious.  We need a clever malingering disincentive that does not protect the financial interests of insurers so keenly.  It probably could be built into the copayments system, which, realistically, it already is.\n\nIf we did have a system in place to make costs manageable, then we would probably have to give the medical debt recovery process more teeth in order to keep all of our medical people from fleeing into the boutique medicine sector on account of not having taken a vow of poverty.
I'm ashamed to admit it, but I am a fan of machinima.
I imagine they'd pretty much have to if the ship is going to be accelerating during the process.
*Sinister* is latin for left, so really, his "advice on facebook" (?) would have been *dextrous*. 
Well, the sample size is small, but our cats used to reach up to try to turn door knobs in order to enter closed rooms.  There wasn't any Skinnerian process involved in teaching them.  They simply observed us and engaged in mimicry.
I feel empire should put limits on what can be manufactured in secure space.  Sketchy items should be produced in lowsec.\n\nAlso, nerf npc stations.

When they tried to retreat into managing their own states, the national opposition came after them.  Any additional powers extended to branches of the federal government will inevitably be turned against the party that enacted them.\n\nThe polite, demurr conservatives were silenced one by one by the media, almost effortlessly in most cases.  Now they're accepting direction from a new strain of right populists specifically adapted to survive in such an adverse environment.\n\nFor conservatives, either they get some of what they want from the federal layer government, or the country turns towards curtailment of national administrative powers.  Win or win.  A significant fraction of GOP legislators and an even larger portion of their constituents don't care how much needs to be broken at this point.  Whatever they rebuild from the wreckage will be more acceptable.   As Mikail Bakunin said, "The passion for destruction is a creative passion, too!"
What I'd really like to see is a system that let's you access all superluminal communication system features from anywhere, so long as you were connected to the network, aka docked in a station.  \n\nThat way, we could talk to someone docked in a station in Motsu, or access market data there, or even use the ship fitting services there, even when we were docked in a station in Frarn.  If we want to use any available services in a system, we should have to logon to the "localnet," assuming there is a functional station or system service available.\n\nNot regged, no services.  ie, no wallet service, no updating skills, no market search, no inventory search, no mail service, no agent comms or payouts, etc.  If you think about it, it would really make most of jspace feel like the boonies.\n\nIdeally, we can see everyone on the network based on their access point.  Locator agents can tell us where the user last accessed the network.  Minigames are possible, like location spoofing from sketchy lowsec stations.\n
All chickens must earn their keep.  Chickens and compost go well together.  They constantly dig through the compost looking for grubs, thereby turning over the top layer and incorporating elements.  The grubs don't like the heat and low O2 gradient at the deeper parts of the pile.  Meanwhile, their droppings and feathers are excellent amendments along with eggshells from the kitchen.
Or just repeal all of it.  That's fine too.
Owning any of that is just an hilarious exercise in futility if you are an alcoholic.

Smoking makes you look younger because it demonstrates that you don't seriously consider the consequences of your choices.  
Honestly, we should move away from pure asteroid minerals on all ships, especially the heavier ones.    \n\nShip replacement should stimulate many market sectors.  Insurance also has an outsized effect on design considerations.
I don't see how that is relevant.
That only caters to a particular style of corp management.
I have to look up how log functions work every time I want to convert  them into a different form.  \n\nNo matter how many times I see it, I can never remember how to go from log form to index form.
Unlike natural gravity, artificial gravity can be converted into normal force.  The trick is that you want to use fewer artificial masses and more generators.  The reason for this is both that narrow field gens use less power than mass blocks, and because mass blocks are subject to normal gravitation force, reducing total system efficiency.\n\nThe calculations of needed force for station keeping is simply the ratio of normal downward force in effect on the entire ship versus the multiple of the total artificial mass and the net artificial force working upon them.  The closer you have this, the less energy your thrusters have to expend to correct for the error.\n\nThere are good reasons for operating at high altitude.  For one  thing, 5-10% gravity is normally going to be quite costly in fuel over long durations.  If your opponent isn't prepared for it, they likely won't be able to sustain their presence.  Additional considerations is that conflict there is decisive.  There can be no warp outs, nor can reinforcements swiftly join the fray.  Whomever loses the duel also loses the fight against gravity.
How does one go about listing that on a resume?  Placenta pirate?  Fertilization freebooter?  Blastomere buccaneer?  Morula marauder?  Conception corsair?  
It should be left up to individual states.  \n\nRemember those old sinks, apparently more common in the UK, where there is a separate spigot for hot and cold?  You either have to fill the basin or move your hands back and forth really quickly to get an even temperature.\n\nTo me, that's the best analogy for talk radio and television news programs today.  PBS and especially NPR syndicated programs do have an editorial line.  It used to be a more subtle one of omission, but less so today.
I like how a big increase in sedimentation followed by a drop off competence almost automatically makes a braided stream.

That type of plastic is generally [polystyrene](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polystyrene), or [polyethylene](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyethylene).  Humans generally only consume liquids that are mostly water, a polar solvent, so such containers are generally serviceable even across a wide range pH values and temperatures.   However, the polymer chains can be dissolved by nonpolar solvents, which includes enamel thinner.  
Perhaps this will be the year that coastal enclaves start to recognize the civic value of states' rights.
I guess it all depends on the crystalline structure of the carbon to determine the density.  Each carbon atom has a lower mass than each oxygen atom.  \n\nLuckily, in our atmosphere nitrogen and oxygen tend to occur in bonded forms as well, so that helps a little. \n\nThe main issue is that it's condensed matter, and that carbon tends to form tight bonds with other carbon atoms.  The lowest density solid currently known is graphene aerogel.

You don't pay a higher bracket on rates.  You pay the first bracket up to that limit, then you pay the second bracket on the amount following that one.  The IRS doesn't give a shit if you somehow worked 169 hours in a week, only the gross for the year as an individual.  Businesses are a bit different, of course.\n\nIn 2016, I would have paid 0% federal income tax on the first 9,275 I earned.  Then 15% on the next dollar up to 37,650.\n\nI'm not saying it's a good or bad system, just how it is.

FAKE Immigrant.\n\nNo really, they all have fake or stolen documents.  In CA and NY, having fake ID is only a misdemeanor.  In other states, it's often a felony.\n\nThe obvious solution is to roll out a national ID, or at least pass national felony statutes for impersonating a citizen.
The only major issue is that flooding fields complicates the hell out of nitrates management.  One levee breach and you'll lose it all.  Flood the field too early after application and you'll lose it all.  It's a very mobile nutrient, but also one that is quickly oxidized by soil microbial activity in aerated conditions.\n\nIn this part of the world, rice is intercropped with the ever popular crayfish, which also enjoy flooded conditions.
The problems of the mass man are best left to him.  Altering the environment is one of the most democratic activities in which we tend to participate.  \n\nEvery person and every organization involved in the processes of anthropogenic environmental change is basically involved in unlicensed experiment.  I see no reason why anyone else lacks any equal right to engage in their own experiment to tilt things a different way.  That doesn't entail roping anyone else in by fiat.\n\nGiven the difficulties one may encounter, my only practical advice is to learn to swim.  Alternately, move away from the coast pre-emptively and diversify your material security and social utility.  We may see a billion fewer people in our lifetimes.  I hope that we maintain a large enough population to sustain a technologically advancing civilization, but it's not really my concern if we don't.  Nature understands equilibria.  She has done lots of homework problems in that area.
I appreciated the acknowledgement of a multipolar worldview from the previous administration, but am I was also a bit nonplussed about the general failure to de-escalate from global conflicts during the last eight years.  \n\nThis business of being on a perpetual war footing is an issue with both parties.

I'm skeptical of the idea that the public has much influence in whether or not nuclear reactors are built.  They don't mount much effective opposition to anything another company of people wants to accomplish.\n\nThe reasons for slow energy industry adoption of nuclear must be principally economic in nature, even if a big portion of that is regulatory burden.

Apparently, such resins are usually softer than calcite, and so pretty easy to shape.  You can also manipulate them by heating.  Larger works are often smaller worked pieces that have been fused together by partially dissolving the amber surfaces.

Catholic schools don't produce Catholics.  The occasional plaid skirt fetish maybe, but that's about it.  A lot of charters aren't religious either.  \n\nIt makes no difference what you teach a young person to think if you don't teach them how to think.  Likewise, it doesn't matter what you ask them to read if you don't teach them how to do so.  \n\nIf we go and look at prison populations, the number one factor that most characterizes them is limited literacy.  The very worst thing we could choose to do about failing public schools is to do nothing.  Far better to do the experiment and see what the data tells us.
And how would voting for Clinton and the DNC manage to not also be racist again?
Does gravity start at 5%?  Sounds like you've incremented it down to tenths of a percent at the outermost radius.  I do wish we had that as a default.  
I like to use the analogy of a twig. Take a long twig and apply a force to each end in compression. The twig will bow the break. However take a twig the is shorter and it will require more force to break. The same logic applies to the connecting rods in the cylinders of the motor. Motorcycles tend to have short strokes. My FZ-1 has 1000cc of displacement but only travels 58mm or 2.28in. That is a pretty small stroke and keeps bikes connecting rods acting like the short twig.

The main thing about oil you have to worry about is penetration and if its bad for powder in you ammo. Its the reason you have specific gun oils and don't use WD40. WD40 penetrates ammo and ruins powder. I wouldn't use motor oil on guns. Gun oil isn't expensive and its made for the purpose. Now for hand tools like wrenches and hammers I coat them in motor oil sometimes for rust prevention but again, I wouldn't use it on my guns.

My mothers reaction was very similar. We told her to cover her ears when the car was doing its run. She said the burnout wasn't to loud so she'll be fine. She was turned saying something to my dad when they went full throttle the first time and her exact words were, "What the shit was that?!?!" Me and dad laughed.

Ok, you don't know how much I appreciate you taking the time to do this because it pointed to serveral lines of thinking that I had that were all wrong and I'm glad they got sorted out as I am seeking to be able to carry starting this year in October. I would love to ask you a lot more questions pertaining to the subject and how to make my point on the principle of reciprocity. I am going to shift my outline to to a few "new" points of discussion.\n\n1) Defending your well being is an innate human right and carrying a handgun is the best tool to do so with.\n\n2) Non reciprocity only serves to harm make the law abiding population more vulnerable as criminals do not follow laws anyway or making the holders a criminal if they don't follow the convoluted law to the letter.\n\n3)There is strong correlative evidence to suggest that the rise in CCW holders is related to a falling number in violent crimes nationwide.\n\n\nI feel like these points would be alot easier to argue and defend rather than coming at it from a legality standpoint. You're right that statistics on the subject are hard to find and I belive that is in part due to gun lobbies.

Thanks for the good luck! I know a national registry isn't a good thing at all. What im proposing is keeping how the CCWs are issued up to the states like drivers licences however implimenting a standard of acceptable practices so that laws dont get comfusing between states. It protects the states rights to choose how to issue the CCW and prtects the citizens by not alloing the state to turn them into a criminal when they get called on some wildcard law. Ive read stories of concealed weapon holder trying to check in their guns in places like NY and being arrested on possession charges. I know they should read and understand the laws before going in but that part of what im arguing.

I think, and someone feel free to correct me, when the salt is poured on the slug, it creates a concetration gradiant across there mucas membraned skin. When there is a gradient physics always trys to find an equalibrium in the concentrations. As a result all of the water on the inside of the slug moves through its skin to the salt to try and balance the gradient. This means the slug dries up and shrivels.
Sadly my uni doesn't.

What makes the 1903 Experimental different than a standard 1903 is the device being removed from the bolt called the Pederson Device. It replaced the standard bolt with a .30 cal gas blowback pistol essentially. What you are seeing in this animation is the soldier removing the Pederson device from the rifle and replaceing the original bolt converting it back into a normal 1903 for use of K bullets.

The thing I love about the movies is the gunfight scenes that portray amazing weapon handling. Keanu actually shoots competion 3 gun matches and SLAYS them. It has really come alive and the action sequences are really cool. Not to mention they portray firearms as something that needs to be reloaded! Which is rare for Hollywood to say the least. On top of that knowing his reloads are silky smooth like that is amazing to watch. \n\nThis is the opion of a gun guy and I really just appreciate the way the guns are handled in suck are precise way.

He was off duty and it was a very minor offence. No reason to not just call it in and go about his day. Instead he chose to escalte the situation with a bunch of 13 year olds to the point they tried to free their mate. Now I'm not condoning the actions of the children however, they are children who just walked on the man's yard. Hardly a capitol offence. This officer was looking for a fight, for confrontation. That combination with a badge of authourity and a firearm are a really dangerous combo and we end up with a shot being fired like we saw here. Luckily nobody was hurt. Even as a pro 2nd amendment person I cannot condone these actions at all.
Really? I usually ever hear the subtle, "Speeeeeeeeeeeed".
The only drawback I see is the amount of time it takes to convert between them. Typically you pistol is a last resort needed in pinch situations. However the ammo capacity could be considered the balancing point! Worth thinking about at least!🤔
Well from a dynamics standpoint that can be the case depending on how you set your frame of reference and coordinate system.
Just like kicking his desk. Gavin has to be the smartest dumb guy I've ever seen.
The pederson device itself actually contained a rifled segment the have the dimensions of the 30-06 the 1903 fired. This allowed a realatively smooth transition from device to rifle barrel. The bullet wasnt just bouncing around. Secondly, I'd like to point out the 9mm wouldnt even fit down the barrel of the 1903 seeing as it was chamber in .30 cal or 7.62. 9mm is just to big. Instead, the pederson device actually chambered .30 cal pistol ammo designed for the device! The K bullet maintaind the regular dimensions of the 30-06 and functioned just like any other round.
Nope, not astroturfing.  Just a guy who likes guns praising a movie that correctly portrays them!
What did the original comment say, he deleted it and I'm curious.
This is exactly the situation I am in.
IIRC the reason most scatter is not because of the sound but the exhaust. When they start these they start them on gasoline and switch them to nitro methane. When it burns the exhaust has a pepper spray like effect and burns eyes, nose, and throat!
It's a cat, calm down.
It was a real thing! Soldoers were expected to keep the bolt in for long engagments like trench to trench. Then swap to the pederson device for storming the enemy. It gave a major firepower advantage to the men using it. IIRC it held 40 rounds of .30 cal pistol ammo. It didn't pack a punch but could be spammed. Plus a pistol cartrige out of a have rifle was a super stable platfrom that allowed for really accurate and sustainable fire. Forgotten weapons on youtube has really good videos on many guns in BF1 including the pederson device.
Because I can't keep them in my housing and they offer no alternative. So I can't get access to them at all.
Dice plz.
Honestly you should start by not automatically calling all liberals "idiots" in your post and grouping everyone in the same basket. We are all people and shouldn't name call everyone we don't know. See how this works in reverse: \n\n"whenever I try to tell people here how bad Donald trump is, they just downvote me and call me a MSM shill. What can someone do to just make these idiots realize they're not the final word in politics"?
What exactly is your evidence for your claim? A college degree increases lifetime earnings by a very significant amount and is a great investment. NYU is a private institution and I don't get why people on this sub care so much what courses others decide to take. If private religious schools can have bible classes then one of the best schools in the middle of one of the most diverse cities in the world, where different races interact with each other constantly, can have a few courses like this. It's not like they stopped offering their engineering, computer science or math classes right? 
It was super friendly and I got some shots of it licking hands. I guess this was a very touristy area.
Yea I was thinking of doing that, but as kind of a last resort lol
This was taken in Russia which may explain the gloomy facial expression. Source: I'm also russian and frequently have gloomy facies when I'm actually happy inside.
Thanks! I'd love to hear of any other places that aren't so well known that have good views if you've got any in mind. 
Always looking to improve so definitely appreciate the feedback. I've never dabbled with filters before so I might give it a shot next time!
And just to add, from personal experience (MD in the Bronx), when I convince my patients to cut out soda from their diet and replace it with water or diet beverages they lose weight. Obviously anecdotal evidence but I think a fairly intuitive result. 
Moving from Colorado back home to NYC. Drove for 15 hours, pulled over at a rest stop and went to sleep in the car leaving my window slightly open. Around 4:30 am, I wake up because a state trooper is knocking on my window. Dazed and confused, I roll it down and he points back behind my car and says "you could have prevented this". I look back and see a truck trailer completely on fire about 20 feet back from my tiny Civic. At this point I'm kind of peeing my pants and the trooper says "Just kidding, but we do need you to move so the fire truck can get closer and put this out". \n
The mental image of that Is hilarious!
Which ones in particular? I've been in Buff for 3 years and know some nice places but I'm sure there's tons I've never seen.
That's a good way to discourage people without insurance from going to the ER. What ends up happening is they get sicker and sicker, eventually requiring even more advanced care that costs the county even more money. Staying in the ICU for several days costs way more than what someone without insurance gets back on their tax return. So we the people end up paying for it anyway. 
I'll give them a call thanks! It's a secular wedding but maybe they can still do it?
Started first 2 weeks in the ER never having worked in one before. This was one of the busiest ERs in the nation in a major city. Tiny space with stretchers wall to wall. Watched a gentleman with a 6.8cm AAA squeeze his belly between stretchers to try to get to the bathroom. Was completely lost the first week, but had some classic cases like an upper GI bleed that required "quick 2 large bore IVs". We did all the right things which made me feel great but the GI fellow chewed me out because I didn't do them fast enough anyway.  Also did enough rectal and pelvic exams to last a lifetime. \n\nThen switched to night medicine for two weeks. Loved it! 2-4 admissions per night with just me and the senior making decisions, pages, rapid responses. I've yet to be in a code still. \n\nNow on vacation! Overall I'd rate it a 6 out of football stadium. 
The authors acknowledge that these are factors they could not control for. It doesn't invalidate the study - their conclusion appears accurate given the limitations and data they had. This is true of pretty much every single study ever done. \n\nYou can argue that one or more of these limitations is significant enough to sway the result but you'd probably need some data to back that up. \n\nHowever their study as designed showed an association, and just because there were limitations doesn't mean we can simply disregard it IMHO.

Statistically NYC is one of the safest cities in the country. Are we giving dems credit for that too? 
Can you clarify what you mean? Benghazi was constantly on TV, in all he newspapers, even in the presidential debate and I'm not just talking about Fox News. There was a massive congressional investigation that was reported on by every outlet. 
Are conservatives for these things? Is his speech just more foil to criticize the democrats with or should it be evaluated by the ideas it contains?
So I read this article. If NYT is guilty of anything it's quoting out of context. They didn't make the quote up, he did use those words. And to go further, he includes "criminal aliens" as people he'd "throw the hell out", which from my understanding is anyone who is here illegally because that is a crime. 
There is plenty of evidence that sweetened beverages lead to obesity, both observational and experimental. Here's a 2006 meta review (review of available studies on the topic) that includes over 30 studies, concluding that consumption of sweetened beverages results in obesity, and removing sweetened beverages from say, schools, decreases obesity rates. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3210834/
Hah thanks! I did post just that 3rd peace bridge one on FB before so definitely possible. Probably not my mom though...
I'm new at this! I didn't realize Flickr was frowned down upon? Sorry!
What is your actual criticism with the study? What did they not control for that you think is a confounder? This is from the abstract directly: \n\n> State same-sex marriage policies were associated with a reduction in the proportion of high school students reporting suicide attempts, providing empirical evidence for an association between same-sex marriage policies and mental health outcomes.\n\nThe news articles about this I've read don't overstate the conclusions and say it's an association with reduced attempts which is accurate if you accept the conclusion. You'll never get a prospective study looking at this subject so it's the best we have. What is your criticism exactly? I read it so let's discuss.  For others here's a link to the original study. \n\nhttp://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapediatrics/fullarticle/2604258

Just an FYI: CPR is about 20% effective in the younger age groups, but when you get over to the 40s, 50s and so on it plummets to as little as 2-3% (in the oldest patients). Medical shows have trained us to think that CPR can "hold out" any patient that is in cardiopulmonary arrest until they get to the hospital but that is not the case. It IS effective in specific situations where the patients have certain heart issues ( but of course we have no way of knowing this in advance).\n\nMy point is, if you do CPR it's probably much more effective on a kid who almost drowned vs. an elderly man who collapsed in his home. And if that man has a DNR than that gets into a whole host of other issues.\n\nTo add to this thread:\n\nIf you think somebody is having a heart attack (major chest pain, etc) and you are not near a hospital, you can give them a big dose of aspirin (160-300mg or so) by crushing the tablets and putting them under their tongue. This is generally the first line treatment for most chest pain / suspected MI in hospitals anyway.
Provide an anecdotal declaration of your self importance to counter an anecdotal declaration of another persons self importance? Wonderful. Sad to see both a scientist and an engineer provide zero sources or actual evidence of their assertions. Move along.

How exactly is this astroturfing? Tompkins county contains Ithaca and Cornell university, both very liberal, but are in the NY23 district. They organized and went to a town hall ran by their representative whose views they oppose. They had a guide for how to effectively do that - that doesn't make it astroturfing, and is literally the playbook from the tea party town hall protests https://thinkprogress.org/right-wing-harassment-strategy-against-dems-detailed-in-memo-yell-stand-up-and-shout-out-rattle-him-94e9af741078#.a6y3hipg4
The four individuals responsible were found and arrest within what, a few days of the incident, and charged with appropriate charges just as quickly. The Chicago PD initially made non-specific statements while actually investigating, and once that was complete appropriate charges were filed. Why are we still talking about this? There's literally no issue here.
That's a lot of ridiculous language over Obama getting a book deal. Last I heard this wasn't illegal and was obviously expected as most presidents end up writing books. So relax. 
You don't necessarily do CPR to save a persons life. You do CPR to keep blood moving to their brain, such that if they do eventually make it to the hospital ICU or an AED, their brain will at least have been somewhat oxygenated and if normal heart rhythm is restored they have minimal neurological damage. \n\nie, you usually aren't doing CPR to help a person live immediately. Just keeping their brain perfused to reduce brain damage in case they survive.\n\n
Sucks to hear that, I may have to do the friend route as well. 
In 1965 we also treated pretty much everything with penicillin and "monitor in a hospital for 30 days". Medicine is extremely different now and it's more expensive because imaging, medications and procedures are now standard of care that weren't close to possible in 1965. 
seems about right...
We may never know his motive 
Clearly, he was provoked by Trump's white nationalism! /s
These white Muslim converts obliterate the "racist" angle from islamophiles, thankfully. 
Who cares about his motive, it was the gun who did the shooting in the name of Jesus and small government. /s/
No you can't.  Name one privilege whites have in law that blacks don't.  
Or you know...you could buy it yourself.  But good for her. If she wants to buy it for people more power to her.  It's a little different than spending tax money you know. 
you do understand sarcasm right?\n
No one?  No one?  Not ONE single person anywhere?   Really?  No one?
How is this the number one top comment?  Fucking bulldhit. 
Why do ALLwhites have "privilege"?   That IS racist.  
Lol.  Ok ok. Relax little man.  Go back to whatever it is you do for fun. 
WTF...we need to build a wall around these people.
Don't compare the two...just don't. 
Wow?  I have guns so I am a Nazi?  You are a fuck face and everything that is wrong in the world.  I'll bet you're fun at parties.
Or get better...or I don't know, maybe put more power to the states and to local communities?
Than that's not privilege.  Acceptance and social acceptance can be found among ALL groups and ALL races.  Shut your mouth and go back to r/politics 
Don't do it!!!!
How many libs do we allow to post to r/conservative???
You didn't say republicans. You said conservatives. 
Well looks like they want to go on offense\n...extremism in defense of liberty is no vice.  So get to work guys.
Really?  When you make such HUGE comparisons that just are not true you look foolish.
wow...such a spiteful little person.  Just because I think it's better for a private citizen to do it rather than the government?  Well I hope you get cancer too.  (there now we are even)
Is that even what I said?  Fuck you're dense. 
I assume it was sarcasm
real fucking mature of them
Some people care about how they are perceived vs good habits.\n
AW's still need bullet buttons?
Impeach??  He's not even sworn in yet???
Than all of his supporters?  Even me?  It's a fucking park.  It's outside.  Park and go hiking. Park overnight and camp.  What do I need a park ranger for?  Protect my picinic basket?
How does this make us suckers?  We still have guns and ammo. I love guns and ammunition. 
"Non-violent"
perhaps you should look into laws a little more rather than just towing the Brown line of "Non-Violent".  Some of the non violent crimes he is referring to are: rape of an unconscious person, human trafficking involving sex acts with minors,  and assault with a deadly weapon.   Real non violent.  Who the hell is upvoting your comment?
Well then...will they get mad if I crank them up?
Maybe sedition or treason charges will bring them to heel. 
Guess I'll be shopping at Macy's 
Stupid advice
Can't anyone take a joke here?
I would love to hear these to see if i is worth saving up for.
Good private dollars are just fine for this.
"Regular Citizens"  I love that term.  I don't care if you're a cop you are still a citizen and we are all regular citizens.
Good\n
so looooooooooooooooooong\n\n
Ok ok. But as of right now no proof that we are going to need to supply receipts for parts that we can purchase via cash out of state or mail order sans FFL.  
I feel you brother\n
oh geez....give it up people...
Ok. What proof do you need before I link to a million different videos?
Oh. Well as long as your predictions are accurate. Ok. Carry on crazy people. 
Forgive my ignorance but, I have my lower already can I buy the stuff next year and assemble and register as an AW then?  Or do I need to purchase and assemble before midnight 12/31/16?
Cops are just citizens too...there is no reason for them to have larger capacity mags than us and no reason for them to have weapons that we are not allowed to possess.  
yes
She is such a disgusting individual.

2?  Did I say 2?  Is english a 2nd language?  And please bitch. Say this shit to my face.  No go back to petting your cat the only thing that ever really loved you. 
I hate to call bullshit....but Are they REALLY bigots?
I'm just sitting here drinking my beer and getting a kick out of you. Don't quit your job to be a psychiatrist...you're no good at it. But next time I'm up there I'll pm you and show you the way around a good ass whipping. Then if you're up to it I'll buy the first pitcher.

I will not sit here and let you spew your racist mouth all over this thread.

Enterprise probably lost a significant number of viewers based on that theme song. I and my whole family stopped watching after the first episode because of it. I watched it later on Netflix and liked the show. But that didn't help its ratings

I thought that the Irish were made of beer, and since beer has a high water content, you should be fine.
Somehow they both look like Jim 
Agreed. The cringe in Scott's Tots just might be the most over-hyped thing about the show. But it's impossible to know for sure, because it's incalculable.
I get the hate, but don't share it. Alexander is way worse than Wesley
It's not hard. Just remind them that Rodgers doesn't play defense. Patriots defense is underrated because they don't have stars. Just a lot of really good players that gave up a league low 250 points.
With all the Christmas parties and Robert California's wine party, I'd say over half were portrayed drunk at least once. Jim and Pam had bottomless champagne at lunch. I can't remember Angela being drunk. Gosh, I'm going to have to do more research on this one. 
Obama fashion show?
You can't fire him without cause, even if it's be-cause you hate him
Shouldn't the loser get the first pick? It'd be far more entertaining watching the two worst teams try to lose. They'd keep screwing it up.

you do know that they didn't have to do anything, right? they already have your money. aside from possible DLC sales, this patch really doesn't benefit them much at all. so please explain what they owe you
Please explain to me how what I said was hypocritical or fascist? That doesn't mean I agree with the other things you called me, but these two especially don't seem to have anything to do with what I said
it's a protest, it's supposed to be inconvenient. that's kind of the whole point.\n\nas to their politics, i could care less if NAMBLA or White Nationalists or Black Panthers marched as long as they did it without violence. The ability to protest is one of American's most sacred rights and whether or not you agree with what the protesters are saying is irrelevant. 
that's an excellent point, so maybe combine the patch coming out with a sale on that title? i never would have bought Syndicate if it weren't for the Pro patch (the updated version, of course) and a good sale at Best Buy
Sure, put one up. Nobody's stopping you. If people want to donate, that's their perogative, just as if you have a daughter and that daughter passes away, you could choose not to set up an account for donations. As always, our response to a situation says a whole lot more about us than it does the situation itself
How do you reconcile that with the fact that your money is very much a social construct? We all believe it has value because legally we have to recognize it as having value. We all do, in part, own your money because without the collective belief in its value, it would be worthless. I feel that you are trying to selectively decide when and how you participate in society, when in reality it is either an all in or all out proposition, and by any participation, you fundamentally argee to all participation by the fact that all aspects of society are interconnected.
Accountabilty to the shareholders and no one else. The government is at least supposed to be accountable to its people
You have an opinion based on your experience. I have a different opinion based on my experience. Both are valid. End of thread.
How did he not lie?
At what point did anyone say it was Trump's fault where the steel was made? The issue comes in where he claims this is good for America because it's made in America, and just like his hats, ties, and pretty much everything Ivanka sells, that is not the case. \n\nSo, spoiler alert: learn to argue the point
Thank god. I've been waiting since November to start a new game on Survival
Exactly. People throw this stat out all of the time without any of the context that gives it meaning.
I know the difference between condescension and condensation so I'm going to go with my reading of the language 
Yeah, unfortunately the system really falls apart when the people elect someone who does not even try to care about them
Quite a nice strawman you've built yourself there. I never said he can't say something (censorship), but I can sure as shit judge him for what he says and I can have the opinion that what he says makes him unfit to be president. As for what Lewis said, which I have to this point not expressed an opinion on, I do not think that his rhetoric serves any useful purpose and is an inappropriate way to show your displeasure with the office of the president. Just because I find fault in one side of an argument doesn't mean I completely endorse the other
I don't understand how people don't get that wealth is a zero sum game. The more you have, the less there is for me. So unless you're fine with having less and less wealth, you should probably be against the collection of huge amounts of wealth by individuals
As the President is responsible for pulling the trigger on these missions, it is his duty to be as informed as possible so as to minimize risk and maximize potential success. I think the father wants an investigation to make sure that the President was fully informed before making a decision and that that decison-making process was carried out with legitimate strategic goals in mind and not some other motive. We might find out that that's exactly what happened or we might find out that it's not, but I don't think it is unreasonable that the father and the public at large find out either way
What do you see as the problem with being a socialist?
Assuming there are roughly three entities fighting for power in society (corporations, government, and individuals), and the relative power of those entities based on organization and shared goals (with individuals being the most fragmented and disorganized), it seems to me that any power given up by governments becoming smaller would almost assuredly be grabbed by corporate entities? Do you think greatly empowered corporate entities would be a better alternative to government? Or do you disagree with my premise and believe individuals would be able to obtain that power? If so, how?
yeah, with all those zero arrests for a march of 2.5 million people
This may not be the appropriate forum for this, but I feel compelled to say something about the tone of your comment.\n\nI have no problem with the content of what you said, which is essentially that  the absence of HDR does not effect your view of games. That is your opinion and exceedingly fine and dandy. The tone, however, is one of thorough condescension, as though I am somehow beneath you for wanting a graphical feature in a video game (smiley faces don't make up for this). The only reason I bring this up is that I would hope to bring your attention to the fact that there are many ways to express yourself that would both assert your opinion while also respecting the opinion of others
The 'coup' part refers to the indirect (or purposefully hidden) agenda of the elected official, which starkly contrasts with his purported agenda of populism
not that I don't agree with you, but this response is a thought-terminating cliche
I'll definitely seek out his videos. I appreciate any time I can engage in debate in a respectable fashion and learn more about the various sides of an issue, so thank you for being a decent person
Who hurt you in this life? I hope you find peace
Please explain why you think income inequality has been growing steadily for the last 30 years.
You do know that military deaths are directly linked to the policies of a country, right? As in that country's politics. Our military isn't doing things "just because".
This again? Your freedom of speech is not protection from other people, it is from the government legally preventing you from expressing your ideas. Therefore, no one's freedom of speech is being infringed upon by people protesting. Do you think if I interrupt you while you are speaking that that would count as suppressing your right to free speech?\n\nAnd, for perspective, I think many policies at colleges regarding political correctness are incredibly misguided and damaging as well 
Lol all the Republicans can do is make policies that help rich people and watch as people too ignorant to see what's happening keep voting against their own interests
Honestly. Why would anyone be loyal to a politician? That's not sarcastic, either. I voted for you for your policies and should you change those policies or fail on any other level of what's expected of a representative (ie taking bribes, lying under oath, etc.), I fully reserve the right to drop my support of you in a hot second.
How do you combat it then?
Just because there is a "war on terror",  a phrase with implications that I won't address here because it's not the point, it does not mean all actions taken in the service of that war are rightful (as much as we can define righful actions in war) and should just be chalked up to "eh, sometimes people die in war." That is a blank check that I imagine very few people would be willing to grant any President.
"This sub uses the man's own words against him, like in this case lying about the pipeline using American steel" FTFY 
I suggest we say Pro-birth instead of Pro-life, because "Pro-life" has a propagandistic quality to it. You want a baby to be born, after that, the mileage of the value and expectation of the  quality of that life very much varies from person to person
Seems like something the 101st best player of all time would do
It's not that he can't say what he wants, like I could say that your baseless accusations and support of a man who supports racism, xenophobia, and misogyny makes you a piece of shit and a pathetic excuse for a human being, it's that, given his position, it's completely unprofessional and disgraceful to do so
So in the absence of either "side" having the power, who do you hypothesize would fill that power gap? 
So what news have you believed in the last entire history of journalism?
I'm a conservative, I'll join
Where do you get your information from, if the traditional media is not to be trusted? (Which I do agree with, but not to such an extreme extent)
Please explain to me how goverments and taxation fall outside of 'natural law' when they have been created by natural beings operating under the influence of natural law. Whether you like it or not, human nature operates in such a way as to create governments and, therefore, taxation. Do you know how I know this? Because it's what's happened. Obviously there are other theoretical options, but they didn't happen, so you are essentially arguing against human nature, which, let me guess, you didn't agree to either.
Do you consider Fox News to be fair and balanced and accurate in their reporting?
"A virtue never tested is no virtue at all."
How is stating my opinion of what he said suppressing him? Suppression would be something like attempting to delegitimize news sources by calling them fake or shouting down an accredited reporter at a news conference and then having my press secretary tell that reporter if he tried to ask a question like that again, he would be kicked out of the press pool. What we have here is a classic case of projection
I would think the US military is far from being deployed to its full extent in Iraq or Afghanistan, as it would be in a domestic crisis/coup/whatever the hell you want to call it
I'm interested in reading the literature on this being repeatedly proven if you could provide a link to the evidence you are referring to
I have x940d and when it set to HDR mode it looked so washed out I thought their was a connection problem, but really, for some reason, HDR mode operates on a different color scale than the other modes, so I found I had to calibrate it much differently than you would normally expect. Amped the color setting up and now it looks amazing
Since the left apparently owns all media (despite them being corporately owned and you know how much leftists love corporations) where do you get your news? Like your airtight proof that Clinton is in bed with Saudis (which I actually think, too)
Nothing personal, but I can't stand when people say stuff like this with a specific group mentioned as the offenders (ie Reddit, liberals, conservatives, Beyonce fans). This is very much a symptom of HUMAN nature, meaning all humans will engage in it to some degree. It is called confirmation bias and colors our entire perception of reality. To say Reddit specifically does it would imply that others don't (by way of holding Reddit up to be some sort of unique situation), which is false and distorts our view of both the group being cited for the behavior and the other groups who are implicitly being regarded as not expressing the behavior.
Read? Reading is for cucks.
Please list examples of the inaccuracies in the movie and whether they are of degree or kind, otherwise what you just said is easily dismissed. Also, your ad hominem attack was pretty impressive
some of it might be jealousy, but im thinking a lot more of it has to do with not wanting to live in an oligarchy
Thornton should definitely be on the top 100 list. Now that I've said something pertinent to the thread subject, I can say how damn crazy it is that Lemieux is there at number 8 on that list while playing under 1000 games.
It also could be that as a man in charge of an organization charged with protecting America, he sees a real threat posed to our safety from the incoming administration. Do Trump supporters view any of the criticism of him as valid, or is everything negative said about him the result of bias?
In-group bias is a lot of times mistaken for racism, but is much less malevolent. Humans are tribal creatures so it only makes sense that we would tend to gravitate towards people we see as members of our group who would therefore be more likely to provide us with benefits as a function of shared goals. More simply put, in-group bias is focused on who you think you are, while racism is focused on who you think they are
I don't disagree that both the delay and the ehancements are disappointing (more so the former than the latter), but I also see anything they do as being a bonus, so I find it hard to feel slighted. It's a fine line, I think, between  demanding quality content from publishers and scaring them into playing it safe by not even trying something for fear it won't meet expectations.
You are on just so, so many lists now
He will stop and frisk them to prosperity, because common sense
Do you not see the cognitive dissonance of denouncing Hillary Clinton for mishandling classified information that may have threatened national security and not caring that the president elect might be under the thumb of a hostile foreign power?
So between your reply, which I believe is right and belies the truth of the fact that we could all be destroyed very quickly by an unrestrained army, and ElvisIsReal's belief that the international optics of an army attacking its own people will force restraint, which is also a valid point, we have yet to discuss a situation in which armed civilians are the reason that an army cannot move against its own people. It seems that only through external considerations far larger than an armed populace, is the army truly kept in check.
Please explain what you know about the climate that has somehow eluded the thousands of professional scientists who are studying the phenomenon. Surely the scientific community would benefit from your knowledge
It most certainly does not apply to Mexico. /s\n\nWhy is anyone seriously arguing that America to Trump means anything other than the United States? That's ludicrous
Out of curiosity, what do you consider to be 'real' media sources?
I think you're somewhat naively assuming that whoever was deploying the army against their own people would be concerned with anything other than defeating the resistance/insurgency, as far as infrastructure goes. And as to the increased resistance issue, that has existed as long as people have, yet has been overcome many times, usually through the application of overwhelming force 
I have given an honest chance to every MGS that has come out and will probably give this a chance, too, mainly because there are aspects of the cinematic and detail-oriented style of Kojima that I can appreciate. That being said, there has always come a point in his games where I yell, "No one talks like this! What is this bullshit! Why the fuck is Rose talking to me right now?!" and I quit playing the game. In my opinion, the depth of the themes he goes into are really only deep to younger people first being exposed to different political and philosophical ideas, which is fine, but it can come off as self-important. Also, having characters deliver endless monologues about complicated issues is not, in my opinion, compelling gameplay nor an effective way to explore those issues in any meaningful way. Kojima is not much for the whole "show, don't tell" guideline, which happens to be pretty important in my eyes. 
Well we didn't see the point in time that raised her suspicions. We also don't know for certain whether he intended to steal those headphones. Any person of any color is capable of theft. Her job probably includes looking out for stuff like that.
This story is such a Whopper
That writer basically wrote an opinion piece. It wasn't just a fact sheet. He went on to try to discredit The Whistleblower and the outlets that ran the story. If you're not even willing to read anything that doesn't support your views I'm afraid your mind can never change
You lucky SOB
Might be tough when the leftist cult is literally equating supporting Trump with supporting the KKK, white supremacy, Nazism, and the like. You must realize this.
They cancelled the speech.

Oh no!! The other side is winning Reddit! My life is over!!! \n\nWait, no, I still have a great job and nice house and my views have traction on the national stage. I'm gonna be fine.
"what's in the patty? WHATS IN THE PATTY!"
Today I learned some families go all in together on a $2 Bowl
How's your national debt looking France?
Yeah, pretty much. They are inventing new ways to push the line back further and further. Words and phrases getting banned. Hairstyles getting banned. Halloween costumes getting banned. Halloween costumes; that is the new standard for racial oppression. A once per year party outfit where people are usually only around close friends and family. That is the current front line of white power. It is ludicrous.
I'm not calling for censorship. Reddit is a far cry from a free speech bastion. I guess you haven't been here very long? Don't remember several of the mass Exoduses of the last few years? All revolved around censorship. Those who disagreed left and Reddit has been becoming more and more of an echo chamber since

Propellent is cheap but it's very heavy. And that affects how much we can carry up. My thought is if there were a way to get to high upward velocity without adding any weight then we could use that weight savings as extra storage 
Yeah, Benghazi was lack of action to cover up Islamic terrorists for political reasons. Then lying to the public about it. Then deleting the records of it. Then stonewalling investigators. Then claiming to be the victim of a conspiracy after investigators dont give up
Still, right-wing motives does not imply native German attackers
Yeah, I'll give you that, but those two elements hardly seem like huge inspiration...It's just the "deal with it" shades in real life. Then a bird for effect. We're not talking about the plot of a Shakespearean play here
Doing nothing is now controlling while dumping money into an industry is assumed to be agenda free? Pass me some of that Kool-Aid, you got the good stuff
I would say we all would consider the murder of children a more serious crime than this moron ripping down a flag. The sensationalist titles of news stories are a separate issue 
Not really. It was a tongue in cheek morning piece about a study saying Mr. Rogers spoiled a generation into being entitled. They openly mocked the study by calling Mr. Rogers an "evil, evil man" while snickering. Typical morning show nonsense banter between the anchors.
It isn't my personal offense that worries me. In fact I don't feel personally offended. It is the campaign to normalize certain concepts and push back certain lines that I find troublesome. All in the name of some product? It feels like a slimy tactic of manipulation or propaganda. 
 I'm more just sick of this completely unmoderated sub
Propellant is cheap, but extra weight for the payload is what we're after.
I read that article too...Very easy to see the writer's bias shining through. That's why I said read one from both sides. Your point about climate inertia had to do with the urgency of the human response. If mankind didn't cause the shift then it is natural cycling.
I only wish I could be super smart like you

Not a conspiracy theory, just a single NOAA whistleblower claiming thumbs were on the scale for the 2015 pausebuster paper. Choose which outlet to read about it in according to whether you want to hear it supported or discredited.

Oh man, I got into his earlier stuff in college.

Yes! A nice track too
Requiring proof of identification before voting is not the same thing as requiring a fee to vote. You can use an ID for all sorts of things. It's not like they have to go out and buy an ID then shred it and burn it after they finish voting.
I agree, she mishandled it. Whether or not he was truly acting suspicious or had any intention of theft
Doesn't matter, had sex
I don't think that's true though.\n\nNOAA just got burned pushing out bad data ahead of the Paris talks then they killed the computers with the research on them to cover it up. There are non-scientific factors influencing what we see and hear and there is power at stake. 
Your weak mind cannot conceive of any difference of opinion it seems. I hope you settle into only the safest of echo chambers friend.
Article says the deal is for three hundred million dollars of precision-guided Rocket technology. Trump hasn't even signed it yet. It came into existence during Obama's tenure. Obama sold Saudi Arabia tanks worth multiple billions of dollars according to this article. To those lashing out at Trump, where you equally outraged at the tank sale Obama approved?

I absolutely agree it is not the government's job to provide health care for the US. The fact that they've been dumping money on that project for so long is a contributing factor to why our healthcare costs are the highest in the world.
I saw a video of a guy pepper spray girl right in the face
He smiles?   I thought he was missing some facial muscles. 
They held all parameters other than the target parameter (human activity) to some arbitrarily low value and I don't see anything to support that estimation. They said that the **sun's heat output** combined with all other natural forces would account for a 0.1 degree global temperature increase. My point about the simplistic equation is it is laughably removed from fully representing the enormous and incalculable equation that is our planet's weather systems and climate. Also, it takes as part of it's input numbers that have been shown to be prone to manipulation. There is proof that scientists have the motive to drive toward one particular conclusion. Several individuals and groups have been caught tampering with data and always in the same direction. This has become more of a religion than a hard science. The fact that you would attack me personally after a single joke shows that I've committed heresy against the church of the blessed Prius.
What a damn dirty racist /s
You admit you're not into this way of thinking. OP was mocking those who are. I have often wondered whether College liberals are really speaking for the populations and demographics they claim to Champion with this backward thinking.
Not sure you understand my post 
What?
I sense a disagreement
Are you asking about Trump and his followers or asking about me? Because I would disagree with anyone who supports Saudi Arabia Trump Obama Clinton or otherwise
Hmmm...Didn't see that /s a minute ago...
But I don't care about Brown posts
That's fine. That's how our brains work. We detect patterns easily in order to predict when information is limited. Just give it up if new information proves this wrong and you're good to go.
Just had a thought, I wonder if an appreciable amount of fuel could be saved if we propelled the whole rocket down a track that ended in an upward ramp. The rocket could be propelled by some sort of maglev propulsion then fire rockets at some point toward the end of the track. Just always looks like it is burning off a large amount of fuel to overcome inertia.

I also went to a school where corporal punishment was policy. They also let you choose suspension or the paddle. I never got the paddle but my brother chose to accept it and told me about the experience. He said it was three swats in the principal's office with a large paddle. He was given instructions and the principal told him he would have a minute to regain his composure.
Ron also has hundreds of Originals. When I was in college I had a bit of a problem listening to Ron music all day
I agree, so we both wouldn't call what happened "protesting" then. So what would you call it? Did you see the video from inside the event? Screaming drones did not shut their pink mouths for one minute while Gavin was speaking. In other words, he was not permitted to freely speak.
Nice! Please let me know.
Should Google "NOAA whistleblower" and read one from each side
I used to work right there. I wish I could have spotted one of those bad boys
This is a huge default sub. I agree there should be this content on other subs. It shouldn't be allowed to run the table on an apolitical sub
Why not? He wasn't doing anything wrong, just trying to enter a hall where he had been invited to speak. A mob assaulted and pepper sprayed him. 
No, I'm afraid this subreddit is not representative of the wider population.\n\n Also, when listing the ideas you assumed I support you mixed up sarcasm with non sarcasm. Do you honestly think conservatives support all those positions? The American leftist has gone off the deep end. Trump is a reaction to it. The house and the Senate are reactions to it. State Governors are a reaction to it. The fact that you are not aware of this proves you are the one in an echo chamber
Add it to the pile. Maybe throw a few more Lamborghinis in to my account

I'm specifically wondering about his consistent point about income inequality/mobility. He cites a study stating the single biggest predictor of inter-generational poverty is single motherhood. Then goes on to claim that the breakdown of the family is causing different demographics to suffer economically. \n\nI rarely hear anyone address this claim. He talks so fast and gets protested so often that I don't know what the other side thinks about this. Please discuss
If the people were fully committed to take back control or die then after a certain point the government wouldn't be able to continue. It would kill the country and the government's power either way if enough of the population died.

I'm a staunch conservative and I have no problem with renewables displacing fossil fuels in a natural, free manner. The end result is something I think we need. Solar panels are modular and can be decentralized. The issue is when governments attempt to control this or force it the way they do oil in most countries. Power to the people, literally. That's what I'd like to see. I'm glad to see an energy revolution.

Interesting, so there isn't a single good person who supports Trump. That, my friend, is called prejudice. Unless you personally know all people on the planet of course.
This is why vague charges of racism are no defense at all for being against voter ID laws. On the one hand you have a potential slight disparity of outcome that is not forced by the government. On the other hand and you have people actually violating our Democratic process. Think of the legal taxpaying citizen that her vote cancelled out four times

The only "controversial speakers" are conservatives. An angry obese woman can tour college campuses and strip naked in public while pouring melted chocolate all over her enormous bulk and that is not controversial. Bring a scholar and expert in the settled science of ID is considered too rational and educated for the protesters on the Left to abide speaking.\n\nThe Left never wins arguments or debates because history has completely abandoned them. This frustrates them and triggers their mindless violence.

For any of you people who live outside of the New York area, Schumer is a sleaze bag whose onlyclaim to fame was having Sunday press conferences to spout inane proposals that were always covered because nothing happened on Sunday. He was right up Trumps backside for a decade or so and will say anything to anyone for a donAtion or vote. Most of America will tire of him quickly.

First, your employer bought this coverage and formulary. Second, there is another branded drug in the same class that is most likely covered. Lastly I don't understand what you are saying about Augmentin. There are replacements for that that dirt cheap. There is no reason for someone to only tolerate the branded form. It's simply Amoxicillin plus clavulanate. 
How so?  I went and there was no hitting or mean stuff. They strolled the elephants down the road from the train station to the arena. 
This move makes more sense than the San Diego move. I would be pissed if I lived out in Oakland but never assume your sport teams give a shit about you as fans. It's what cash you will cough up. The Jets and Giants shook down the NJ taxpayers but good to tear down a pretty food stadium to build the silver POS we have now with no cover. 
Yes we are so fucked. Might as well give up. Really?
yes. You will know it once you experience it.

It's a newspaper site linked to the Press of Atlantic City. In case you have not noticed lots of links to local papers charge or limit access. Why get so pissed off? The NYTimes, WSJ and Guardian in the UK do it too. One needs to make money. 
No they are not getting special funding. They are free to compete and offer services on their own. 
I bet it does. Or, no one ever gets compounded drugs and all suffer.

This is such a load. The pipeline is going on the shoulder of an existing road. It will convert a foal plant to cleaner gas. We need the plant here because we are shutting a Nuke plant in a Forked River. Most of the protestors live in the area where the electric plant is and want it gone for a clearer view out there houses. 
Funny how some a hole down votes me for saying the same thing. Greed will kill you. Cash out. 
Lakewood has become a mono societal religious enclave. That is bad for any business. Fact is the fact. 
Doesn't the earth exude crude oil to some extent naturally deep in the ocean?  I suspect that problem found be solved via studies like this. 
I guess you can't tell sarcasm and gentle ribbing in replies. Thus site has turned so UN fun to read and post on.  Go ahead with you group hugs and the rest of us will bust balls on the guy wondering what to do with an investment that yielded over 1300 percent. 
Hell, I would take having his body compared to the shit I got now lol
At this point, when people see UEZ on the sign they already know that they are shopping in a area that is being given treatment because it's poor or deteriorated. This program was to give a boost for a few years to inner city shopping areas. It's way past temporary or giving a boost. Time to have everyone pay the same sales tax. 
Jeezus. With this fucking socialist crap?  This was a couple of crooks. They got caught. Move on. 
Sorry yes wrong person. Meant for dumboy. 
Oh bullshit. When working on computers the Geeks don't spy. When asked to restore a system they random check stuff to see if they are there. Especially if the cusyo er says they lost their photos and videos. Well if you check and see clearly illegal child porn or snuff shit, you tell the authorities. Got a problem with that?   Note: downvoters evidently have a hard on for Geeks or don't give a shit about child porn. This is sick shit. 
If you are looking for a white Italian male murderer, do you not target white Italians?  I guess you would keep the Police dumb and have them check blacks asians women etc to find the perp?  Come on common sense. 
So mocking is part of drawing people to atheism?  I am not against a real atheist or their beliefs. I do question a person who kind of openly mocks and says "come on over to my side". That is kind of an organized belief in and of itself. If you don't believe in a God it should simply be left at that...
Really?  Where you get that info?
Wow what would happen at 6 degrees?  Wow that woukd be like a movie!
Was only a matter of time. Looks like Barack is gonna be the big dog in the Dem party now. The Clintons are yesterdays trash. 
Only a guess but the total cost and what research we were going to do was never justified or thought out. I also have some nagging feeling that the US and USSR secretly agreed not to start a all out "war" to colonize the moon. China however does not mind doing that now. 
They do suck. Tried to make believe they are middle of huge road and were not at all. MSNBC is all left all the time up Dem ass. Fox all Trump or right all the time. CNN meh. 
The only problem is what  do the workers put up to start the busuiss.  They need to to put skin in. Maybe they work for sub oar wages until profits set in then share it?  Otherwise anyone can be hired to do the work. How about profit sharing.  Been around for years and unions hate it. 
The answer lies in just how much of a country's annual budget goes to paying debt payments. When you have 25 to 35 percent of your budget going to this you are setting yourself up to borrow just to meet current needs. Oh, you can raise taxes but what does that do?  Debt payments do not generate anything for the economy overall. Good example is in NJ. Starting last year the gas tax was entirely needed to pay debt on transportation projects already completed. They needed a large raise just to keep payments and to have some leftover to perform some new projects. This pattern goes on until collapse  
Yes those Mormon and Jesuit terrorists are in on it too. Read what you wrote and match it it to recent news and facts. Plus are you suggesting anyone is organizing an extermination of anyone in the US. If so you are really out of touch. 
Brazil is only a few steps better than Venezuela. They can only help so much. 
The taxpayers from other jurisdictions. The tax cut there needs to be made up from the other areas.

McCain turned into a politically nasty turd of a man. He could have won but did his reach across the aisle stuff and got butt kicked. He is also tied up with too many lobbyists due to him being in the damn senate for way too long. 
The Fashion Center one for some reason has more juice than the one in Garden State Mall. 
You miss the point on this issue. PP wants to provide health services and screenings for Medicaid. Nothing to do with their main business which is abortions and contraception.  They seem to reject a State giving another entity money for these services. The State says they do not have a right to receive this as other providers can offer the same services. 
Are you a white personal trying to stir something up?  Can't be believing your statement right?  Anyway I don't like this hate crime stuff. What they did was hateful in and of itself. No need for extra definitions. 
The event that could happen was set in place 10 years ago....large. Scale inflation  and fast widespread devaluations of currency. The huge deficit spending and printing of money to keep borrowing low plus interest rate manipulation will bite us sometime. 
But the Jews were not organizing bomb plots and looking to take the government down. You are really stretching things here. Plus Adolf wrote about genocide before he took over and it was entrenched in their political platforms. 
I think Hawaii has this problem in a big way 
If you go shop for your meds, you can pick up the pill (generic) cheap. The government can't be all to end all. Now if you are talking about "culling" the lower rung of society you have a discussion. Kind of a dark discussion but one none the less. 
Until it doesn't. Ultimately someone is rich off of rigged capitalism in China or told what you can have. The thing will collapse at some point leaving the people SOL. 
Now the young arms have to deliver more innings. He was golden the last two years as a three or four starter. 
This is the monster staring us down. We truly need to drastically reduce borrowing and pay down existing debt. This amount hanging over us is simply way too high. 
Exactly. Bad is bad. Yeh crime is a crime and pay for it. This was no bad choice mistake by kids. 
FYI. Here is a ink to the video :\n\nhttp://my.mail.ru/mail/olegsibn/video/34645/34654.html

Agree but you wil go 10 bucks easy for that sub and drink. 
At a much higher cost. 
Having tenants that are clean, pay on time and don't cause you to resort to eviction is an issue. One tenant who strings out not paying or causes decent damage can wipe out a years worth of net revenue gain in a heartbeat. 
It's amazing how you get downvoted on asking a legit question. Since a fair amount of crude is "leaked" daily from the ocean floor, can this study help answer what happens naturally?  \n\nhttp://www.livescience.com/5422-natural-oil-spills-surprising-amount-seeps-sea.html
PP seems to say it has a right to get funding for this. Other clinics or organizations can provide the same services. If PP feels that this is so important then why isn't the national organization throwing in money to provide on their own?
Of course this is true. But the leaders can make sure there is some incentives or lack of blocks due to over taxation or regulations to create and keep these jobs of the future. This give up it's hopeless stuff is not fair yo workers and future workers. 
Let's see the family go to a filled Madison Square Garden to see Cirque. I like cirque but it's no where near the Circus. 
That store is one of the biggest grossing Best Buy's in the country. Amazing who you see there (football players, musicians and celebs living in Bergen) when strolling through. 
Thou is a kind of old scam. The study part is new though. 
Is not being atheist simply not having a stance at all on those in organized religions or believing in a God?  Your comment does not seem to be that of an atheist, only one mocking from the sidelines. Only saying. 
I take away that there are far too many people that have absolute no want or concept of God. God in any form, religion or manner. This shows no moral compass. A complete emptiness. 
People will immunize their pets at a better rate than their kids. 
Again, if you have been attacked by Islamic extremists who reside in Islamic communities and travel the world, do you not focus screenings on Islamic populations?  Or do you ignore that and focus on all people?  Call if profiling or whatever ,it's common sense. 
This is history that should be taught somehow in every high school level science program. How quick modern society forgets that we are only 50 to 70 years past mass maiming and early deaths due to diseases. 
They should not be funded from the Feds. They should stand on their own with little or very minimal taxpayer support. 
Can't we just say is was a bad crime?  Leave the hate part out because you tourture someone like this by cutting and drinking toilet water, it's hate anyway. This is a slam dunk conviction on the crime alone. 
Why do you ask such a foolish question?  You cashbout at least half.

Opinion. Bush looked to do it but backed off. I think the guys in Trumps cabal will look into again. I don't say outlaw it but tighten who operates in it and how. 
Huh?  Man, you don't move a plant this size. It's been here since the 70s. Transport nat gas?  It's safer to pipe it. Plus, South Jersey needs a secondary pipeline to supply nat gas here from the huge deposits over in PA.  wind?  The greens tried to stop the 5 windmills we have here.  This is a no brainier. Build it now. 
How can anyone be shocked at this?  We can argue about the sheer number of total vaccines one needs but if you want to avoid mass outbreaks and potential loss of life or disfigurement, you have to immunize. At least for MMR, DPT, polio, smallpox (it will make a comeback).  
They did in NJ. They received screening funds for several years to open clinic in a few cities. That funding was shifted to other clinics and hospitals in those same areas and PP took the state to fours and lost. They closed the clinics and no one is the worse for it. 
And nat gas is a great alternative to diesel for trucks. Much cleaner. 
Try explaining the entire story. It's not as simple as you jotted down. \n\nHere is their 2017 formulary\n\nhttps://www.caremark.com/portal/asset/Value_Formulary.pdf
Ugh. That's criminal creepy. But funny. 
This program was supposed to be temporary. After a decade or two it's obvious that it is now simp,y another transfer of money. Any stimulus to try to lure more business to set up shop in these zones are long gone. It's time to roll this program back. 
Check to see how much the NEA contributed to these two. They also Bowed down because they were afraid of the unions picking them in spacey populated States. No backbone ladies. 
You are so correct. You will be downvoted like hell though. This guy seems to mix up politics vs pure power grabbing and true hatred.

This is good. It is so hard to root them out without clear wrong doing.
So who do we write to about this? 
Lock them up.  
Your local Rep/Senators office. State level too.\n\nGet them to push for legislation and introduce at least a grandstanding bill or go on news and denounce this.\n\nOur win condition is simply getting the nation to talk about this: It'll help us spread the truth, push for harsher punishments against foreign invaders AND delegitimize the activist Leftist judiciary.
I personally couldn't give a shit about pot legalization. They may as well get it over with and tax the hell out of it.

Eh, bad example. He went there looking to cause trouble. He had like eight or nine spare magazines on him. \n\nEDIT:  And I say that as someone as progun as they come. When you're carrying, you typically only have one, maybe two spare mags. The fact that he brought so much ammo means he was looking for an excuse to use it. 
My state sucks.
Disagree. I can only imagine what could've happened to him if he wasn't armed. It's a leftist mob and he's a conservative reporter. He was looking to report a story, not become a victim.\n\nAlso, extra irony points for the BLM mob that calls police to protect them from a conservative reporter.

Virginia resident, Caine likely think this crap is alright. I've written him before and while i did get a response all he did was double down on his stance.

You can't punish campers any more than you can punish bunny hoppers. They are opposite play styles everyone seems to hate, but it can't be punished, we just have to nut up or shut up.

I live in super rural NC, took a trip to NYC senior year of high school and had my mind blown. 
Nope I damn sure can't. But I don't need to because I rarely use headphones in anything but my phone. 
One thing to add to your point about Hitler, it wasn't so much conservatives ruining power as the Treaty of Versailles ruining Germany. 
Wow it's almost like Apple doesn't include a pair of lighting headphones in the box, or a dongle just in case. /s\n\nI went from a Note 4 that had its motherboard corrupt and nothing but samsungs before it to a 7 Plus, and 5 months in I'm not regretting a thing.
Well what WW1 era tech would you suggest for ground to air? You forget the setting. There was nothing but AA that could target planes. 
Hmm based on that definition, this seems less like a case of environmental racism and more a case of 1. Outdated infrastructure and 2. A state and local government that ignored scientists saying what your doing will make it worse. 
Well now would be the time to do it with all the Blue states wanting to stick it to trump. The left is all of a sudden worried about how much power the president and federal government have since THEY aren't in control of it. 
Fair point. Criticism of the constructive variety is good, rage is not. 
How is the system racist? Tell me how and we can fix it. Now just saying the reason is systematic racism then patting yourself on the back doesn't solve shit. You cant just say systematic racism is there because it just must be there. You have to have evidence. So show me the evidence and we can work to fix it, otherwise it's like saying the house is in fire and not trying to put it out. 
See that's the thing. There were laws on the book that were inherently racist in intent. Name me one law like that today and I will gladly stand side by side with you in protest. But if you ask me to stand next to you and protest a certain costume on Halloween because it MIGHT offend someone, I never will. Freedom of speech means you have the freedom to hear anything. And you have a right to be offended. But what you don't have is a right to silence somebody because you are offended. \n\nEdit: an Autocorrect because mobile. 
That I can see happening. That's the one drawback I see to pot legalization. 
My moms a teacher as well, but some of the nightmare stories I hear of parents she has to deal with can really give perspective. There's far too many parents who just treat school as a daycare instead of an education system. I do feel that teachers are very unappreciated. That said, your mom sounds like a different person than mine. 
Doubt it would go the same way today
lol you're good (yay I did it right)
People stay farming upvotes by posting anything anti trump. 
Hey the original post is tagged spoilers and spoilers inside so. 
Guns and owning them isn't particularly insane, but the need to guard a place of worship with them definitely approaches insanity. 
Is the movie your referring to titled "Stealth"?
I think London could be cool
Awkwardly mumble "In your name, Amen." Then say "What were we talking about?"
Damn it Gerald. 
It would appear what they're planning to do is oppose trump in everything. Which may make their idiot constituents happy, but any of their constituents with a brain will realize that nothing will get done. 
In cases such as this, where there is Zero doubt, kill em. 
No I haven't honestly. Could you explain?
You do realize deer are heavily overpopulated because of us killing of predators for slaughterhouse animals? You realize that just because I'd rather hunt my own meat, which is organic and leaner than beef, I'm not an asshole who doesn't value life? I'm just a person choosing to live differently than you, and apparently that bothers you. 
I grasp that. But Im not willing to leave a man like this survive. No matter what happens or what scenario you talk about bad things happen to good people. Should we not have gone to war against Hitler since innocent Germans who hated him could have died? Should we not have rebelled against England because innocents could die? Now I agree that no innocent person should die to the death penalty. But no court shout convict an innocent person in the first place. Blame the courts not the inanimate penalty. Or better yet, blame the absolute worst of humanity for even making it to where an innocent could be tried in their place. 
If I'm being honest I got pretty attached to Ethan in IWs campaign. And considering (sorry anyone who hasnt played it) almost everybody fucking does, I got a bit emotional at that. 
Yep that one too. Though there is quite a bit of misinformation going around about that. I had to do a research paper on it, and the court docs from the failed injunction are quite telling. 
Can confirm, I prestiged like 8 times in a about a month no lifing the shit out of the game during summer. For some perspective my dorm on my college campus had a block on the internet that didn't allow game consoles as they would eat too much bandwidth. 
"I've got a jar of dirt"
Well I was a nerdy, super skinny white kid in my first year in high school, and nearly the only person I hung out with was my best friend and neighbor, a black kid named Darrius 4 years older than me. Well by virtue of being influenced by friends, I went to school one day in Jordan high tops, a polo, and sagging shorts. Was ridiculed relentlessly. So not really a phase but a moment in my history. \n\nFor those interested, Darrius is set to be my best man next year when I'm married to the love of my life. 
Oh yeah I meant if he was a lifer in general population. My bad
Very similar. Ending will also get you emotional. I always play the campaign in 1 sitting on a Saturday afternoon. Much better that way, more like a movie
Because there's a substantial difference between the death penalty and all the insane things listed in this top comment. 
Saving this for watching later. 
In this guys case other inmates would kill him pretty quick. They don't mess around when it comes to crimes against children. 
It was more a case of Charlotte wanting to force businesses to operate a certain way, whether public or private. Had the charlotte law been about say, certain mandatory business hours, no one would have given a shit when it was repealed. But because the left is making their stand on trans bathroom rights (which doesn't help 99.7% of the US population) they latched on. 
Colorado has made at least a billion dollars off tax revenue from the legalization IIRC. I also think I read somewhere they've had a decrease in fatal car accidents too. 
That's not how that works. Because he is exactly what they are looking for. "Tell us what went wrong and why you left the game so we can make it better and you'll come back" is a good strategy because that makes it better for everybody too. 
It clearly says "my thoughts...is that it's a terrible stat." Not that it isn't one. 
Tell me one that is inherently racist in intent. 
IIRC only 1 rifle has a bullet and the others have blanks. One person prepares the rifles and another who doesn't know which one has the bullet distributes them to the squad. Then they all aim at one spot and fire simultaneously. The 1 bullet pierces heart and kills instantly. So it's no waste of bullets lol
Yeah my head jumped straight to something like "the sun shines better on places white people live." And trust me, I've heard people argue stuff just that dumb. 
Oh cool. Small world I love in Greenville. Cool to see a fellow North Carolinian. Well written I may add. 
Depends on the country. Not all countries have the same prison standards as the US
No hunters love hunting for the exact reason Chris Pratt says. Did you watch the video? It's called hunting for a reason instead of killing. The same way fishing isnt called catching. If you want to paint all hunters as sadists with zero value for life, try again. 
Also fair
If I hear a horn and for any reason think it's directed at me I lose it. 
Can't confirm, we used the clean version of it all the time. \n\nSource: From North Carolina
We are. So we should use that advantage. 
Holy shit I just went over there to peek, never again. The circle jerk was unreal. People were crying about how relatives voted trump and they can't stand their own parents etc. just a pathetic group of folks. 
No your correct, but when someone of the SJW kindest feels they are correct in their actions they also feel laws don't apply to them. \n\nBring the downvotes. 
BO3 had no weapon variants. All it had was the ability for attachements to look different. 
Car horns...
Religions are categorized as races though! 
War in Syria\n\nIran, Russia, North Korea all acting more aggressive \n\nMigrant crisis in Europe\n\nFlint, Michigan water issues\n\nAnd a myriad of other things are more newsworthy than a trump tweet. You make a good point friend, if people wanna know about a trump tweet they should follow him. 
Yay for democrats 
As a fellow hunter I couldn't explain this any better. It's the thrill of all the parts coming together to make a whole. 
Greensboro, NC?
Because to some of the SJWs something mild like one racist joke is equal to burning a cross. 
Well what's yours? \n\nMine is:\n\nDeath Penalty ends the lives of people that have done things so reprehensible they no longer have value to society. \n\nSaudi is just regular civilians basically having a fucking purge night 24/7 against LGBT and Christians. 
And we have those
No I don't because putting the bullet through the neck isn't the most humane shot. And maybe we enjoy the kill because that's the end goal, but don't mistake that for enjoying suffering. 
Agreed, and I play mainly on a 2000 ticket conquest server
You know what's less painful and quicker than lethal injection (that fails sometime)? 12 gauge buckshot to the back of this dudes head. 
I'll help explain a little about it as someone who lives here. When it comes down to the civil war, it's about states rights. Now the right in question IS slavery, however the reason for secession was they felt that the US government was unfairly targeting the south. The north also had slaves. So was the civil war about slavery? Yes and no. \n\nAs for the right to free speech, yes it's so the government can't infringe in it, but it has also been interpreted so that individuals can't infringe either. Now some elements of the far left and far right seek to silence opposing view points. Look at left leaning college campuses banning conservative speakers, or just not granting permission to conservative clubs to invite them. The far left attempts to silence opposing views due to so called "Micro aggressions" and the far right is more of the white supremacist BS. \n\nUnfortunately, these two groups are the loudest and most vocal minorities and they skew the views of more moderate people on both sides. 
The right fights for people's fights too, just not the way the left does. It's different ways to do the same thing
Over expenditure \n\nFTFY
If it wasn't temporary thing until a better process is sorted out, and it was a permanent ban, AND it focused 1 specific group from said countries instead of all people, yes I would. 
I'm more of a moderate conservative myself. Small gov, strong military, fiscal responsibility, etc\n\nEdit: also my comment on the left was kinda of a why they lost explanation. They essentially pandered to the super tiny minority's and ignored the middle class. 
You. I like you. Not many folks on the internet can admit they are wrong
Last I checked the game ran on Activision servers so maybe lay into them instead. 
The court documents. They are very informative on what's actually going on if you want facts over emotional appeal

In America at least it's innocent until guilty. Remember the Amanda Knox case, where Italy basically made her prove she wasn't guilty when they couldn't prove that she was IIRC. 
As a very picky eater, I can say forcing them to try a food They don't want to is not helpful either
I've always hear the air force gets shit till someone needs an air strike 
My thoughts personally on that is that it's a terrible stat. The death penalty should not be abolished though, just reserved for cases such as this where there is a level of certainty that the convicted did it. 
Systematic racism would mean something in the system is inherently racist in intent. 
God damn I love this site
Think you're looking for the sub r/TwoXChromosomes
See most people in the south know this, but no one ever believes it when we say it. 
But those GOD DAMNED SQUIRRELS LOUD AS SHIT...
Just don't go out there anymore.   
Your rights don't bother me at all. I was mainly stating that had the issue been anything other than  a democrat talking point the publicity wouldn't have blown up like it did. Hell after everything died down the democrats in charlotte admitted to only passing the law to keep McCrory from being reelected. So essentially they used your rights as a pawn. Just how the dice rolled. 
Please define environmental racism because the what I'm thinking it is can't possibly be right and if it is then the concept is retarded.

Yah,  I only caught a few of his games with the Habs,  didn't have the ticket when he was around. 
Where I come from that is called "desensitization" and I would argue to my last breath with you on your stance.  I think "drawing attention" is a byproduct of their actions/intentions.  It deserves your attention.  It deserves everyones attention.  I always ask people with views similar to yours whether they could maintain the same conviction if they had to explain to someone who lost a loved one to terrorism how we shouldnt be that concerned about it.  I dont get many replies, but I like to think that it at least gives them/you a new perspective to consider.      
Again,  thanks for taking the time.   :)

Genre- Hard/Progressive Rock\n\nHappy Friday!  My band Sewn Silent just wrapped up "Shudder".  We recorded this using Reaper, and a handful of "decent" mics.  I share music to my Facebook page when we finish it, but we rarely get any constructive feedback, usually just the friendly canned answer or odd "like".  It would be really appreciated to get some actual feedback so we can continue with our vision, possibly modify it to garner a larger audience, or put the instruments back in the closet and leave them there.  \n\nSo without further ado- please take a moment to listen and offer anything that comes to mind.\n\nhttps://soundcloud.com/sewn-silent/shudder
So any model without the game changer circuitry,  or any model without the boost?   I could literally do without the boost.  
Thanks!  I agree.  I am still trying to polish my drum recording skills.  I think the snare is close, but the kick needs some love.\n\nThanks for your input!
Too many to list from Petrucci.   Melodic overlord. 
This isnt really my "thing", but I like it. a lot actually.  I like the phrasing, and the lyrics are entertaining.  The only thing I am hearing is the delivery seems a bit "restrained".  Like, (and this could be way off, if so I apologize) you are holding back-  as if your vocals were too loud in the mix when you were laying the tracks, so you laid back a bit.  I kept hearing your voice, but kicked up a notch.  A bit boomy-er perhaps.  Bigger?\n\nWhen I record my vocalist, I always ask him when the mix sounds good while he is tracking, and then slyly dial the fader back ever so slightly.

Why don't these people ever pick an appropriate place to "protest" (term used loosely,  because this is usually something else entirely)?  Also,  are they not familiar with the concept of counter-production?   The more I see this,  the less sympathetic to their "cause" people become.

But I will also respect your opinion.  We all have things that have happened in our lives to shape our beliefs.  We obviously have been surrounded by completely different circumstances, and as much as I cannot comprehend your view, I appreciate it.
I dont really have the desire to repeat the same thing over and over to get a point across.  Suffice to say, you wrap your response up with the same point- ignore it and it will go away.\n\nI hope that isnt what they are teaching in med school these days.  Comparing deaths to terrorism to the number of deaths caused by "cows and falling furniture" is massively flawed logic.  Both are accidental (this should be obvious), and terrorism is intentional murder (usually, in some cases it is accidental suicide... when conditions are optimal).  \n\nAt any rate, I am not insisting you are "accepting".  But a passive approach is not going to alleviate the situation.  I guarantee it.  Some things must be met with force.  To respond any other way is coming up short.
I agree with DaJoSi.  Some type of percussion to establish a beat, even if minimal.  And maybe a nice low-end bass line, to accentuate the movement a bit.  I kept waiting for it to "start".  Its a pretty good idea for an intro, just feel like it needs to go somewhere.

After the whip attacked me the first time, I think I would have realized what fate had in store should I continue to tempt it.
I'm almost done. .. Promise.   I'm not a huge trem user,  but we have a couple tunes with a full dive- can it withstand at least a couple of them without tapping out?   Also,  I've only ever played one guitar that had a mix of active and passive pickups- are the passive pickups affected by battery life?   I had a sustainiac installed on my first guitar years ago,  and I suspect the shop screwed it up because I would literally lose drive in my passive pickups when the sustainiac battery started getting low.   I assume the battery is not being tapped unless the piezo pickups are on? \n\nYour answers here could pretty much make or break my pulling the trigger on buying one.

I honestly believe most people overreact when discussing politics today.   I think anonymity has done horrible things for communication, and we have forgotten that we can disagree without hating each other.   It's likely that most of what you believe about the "other", (and I'm sure I'm guilty to a degree as well) is not very accurate.   It's just easier to blow off steam, but that is a big part of why we are where we are.   Too many people don't consider that,  and literally self-radicalize.  Until everyone (I mean both sides) are able to realize that everyone has their own beliefs that were forged over a lifetime,  are generally valid.   We just need to understand that we are all human, and probably blowing shit way out of proportion.   I'm a conservative and I'm married to a liberal.   I know it's possible to meet in the middle.   If anything we certainly see things differently than most cons and libs that would rather tear eachothers faces off than try to see things from their perspective.   It's possible.   Everyone just needs to put the goddamn hatchets away and remember we are talking to actual people. 
I would think most normal people would/should have that exact reaction.  Well, stronger than "irritated".

I always assumed this was photo shopped. 
Thanks for the input.   I guess my assumption about it feeling similar to a soloist was based on the neck radius,  neck thru construction,  and the slight arch on top.   Those things are the biggest "playability" factor for me.   Body shape,  as long as it is at least close to a strat would be close enough- the pointy models not so much.   Does your comparison come by way of experience with a soloist by chance?   
Your comment is down voted,  while the rest of the insults aren't.   How curious. 
Ugh.   Why would anyone design a guitar where active pickups are affected by batteries?   Man.   Rethinking the whole damn thing now.

The fact that you are whimsical regarding the loss of human life is astounding.  People are just "numbers".  Your assumption of a successful argument to a "widow" is kind of laughable.  I am not trying to be a jerk, I just find murder appalling- wholesale murder doubly so.  I should think any decent human being would feel the same.  I am not claiming to have solutions, but I will be goddamned if I could ever think about victims in such a manner as yourself.  I still believe you are wrong in thinking that terrorists are doing it for attention, and if I am correct, your argument is literally baseless.  If I am wrong, I still find terrorism appalling and rightfully so.  Acceptance or indifference to their actions should never be the norm for anyone, statistics or not.  That is part of the reason shit has gotten out of hand, because this garbage has been normalized and accepted as unavoidable.  If that is the case, bring the asteroid because we need a do-over.  Or better yet, leave us out of the picture next time around.

Odd, but interesting!  I think it could use a change personally, and the vocals seem a bit loud in parts.

Please refrain from insulting those of us who voted for Trump. I live in a city on a coast and voted for the candidate I felt reflected what I want the most. He is not the perfect president but he was the best option at the time that aligned with what I wanted. \n\nSo far he has delivered on his promises and I hope and continues this track record. His beef with the media is not without cause as unsubstantiated allegations came one after another from major news networks. Freedom of the Pres does not guarantee that all press is the same. The information will still be put out there but excluding this specific outlets does not strangle the information being sent to the American Public. The information will still go out to the people but they will have to do some research on their own which I highly recommend they do anyways. \n\nThere is nothing special about the NYT that gives them special privileges above a smaller outlet like CRTV. The media are playing into the game he wants them to play by reacting they way they are. It is well known that the main news networks save FOX have an agenda against the president. They have made no attempt to hide it. Instead of moving on from speaking gaffes and some pettiness they amplify it to the point where most of America tunes them out and Trump looks better for it. He's not dumb in the least but the media are treating him like he is. \n\nTHAT BEING SAID\n\nTrump can be very petty and I don't agree with it. Pettiness in a president is not a desirable trait. I didn't like it when Obama was petty and I don't like it when Trump is petty. 
I mean to be fair...\n\nIt's boobs. You'd have to be gay to not like boobs. \n\nEven then I'm pretty sure gay dudes appreciate a nice rack.

The fact that I don't know who shebis (which is my fault I rightly should) and haven't heard her name mentioned at all means she might be doing her job properly 
Yes.
I sacrifice sleep so she can get some quiet time. I'm going to school during the week and working 40 hours. My wife is at home with our 1 year old all day with which is nice but she rarely gets time for herself. So even though I get home from work between 1-2am I will set an alarm for 8am so I wake up before our daughter does. This allows me to make sure I have her breakfast ready by the time she gets up so my wife can lay in bed a little extra in the morning. Occasionally I'll not do this if it's a bad night and I'm not home until 3am but the extra little time in the morning keeps her sane. 
My 15 month-old doesn't wake up often but when she does she'll cry and well tuck her back in. When she wakes up for the day though she just starts running through her animal sounds. It's hilarious to hear her in the monitor going "puppy..... woof woof"

He has a bronze star from his second deployment in Iraq.\n\nHe's never told me why and I've never asked him about it because it's his story to volunteer.\n\nBut I'm damn proud of my dad despite his flaws. 
I like his immigration stance and his ideas on how to cut regulations. I'm not a fan of how he wants tariffs nor with being super good friends with Russia. I'm not going to agree with him on everything but to call me stupid or ignorant when you know nothing about me is simply intellectually lazy and is exactly the type of rhetoric that is poisonous to proper discourse.

It's different with older children than the unborn. That being said I think once you hit 15 which is when you get a driver's license and can opt to be an organ donor you gain a semblance of control over your medical preferences. Until then the child's care is directly under the parent which as distasteful as some choices might be the parents right to parent their child should not be taken out of their hands save for egregious child abuse

So follow up. The thing I see here is a way of getting around the 10th Amendment detailing that the powers not expressly given to the feds is left to the States. Did that have any bearing on this Amendment in particular?

Really? I looked into it just a couple of months ago and all of the stuff I saw online said 31, and my dad (who is an electronic technician for the FAA) made some calls to the Memphis tower and spoke with the lady in charge of ATC hiring. She told him the same thing. Where did you get this info? I'm not calling you a liar, I just need to be 100% sure before I put my eggs in this basket. Thanks for your time

Thanks for the detailed response. I actually have a masters in biomedical science, but I'm tired of being a lab tech. As for ASVAB scores, I took it yesterday and got a M:98, A:98, G:97, and E:98. I really wanted to do ATC, but since I'm 25 now, I'd be 31 upon separation (ATC is 6 years only, right?), making me ineligible to work for the FAA. So now I'm looking at potentially going ATC for the Navy, which has 5 year enlistments, or maybe cyber jobs for the AF. Crypto linguist looks neat, but I've heard the school is devastatingly brutal and the washout rate is high. Can you weigh in on everything I've said? An inside perspective is invaluable

Heller *was* good and did just that. The 4th circuit ignored Heller, Miller, and McDonald in their decision. 
Please educate others! So many people see an "assault weapon" and lose their minds, completely oblivious to the fact that the only thing that makes it "military-style" is that it has black furniture, a pistol grip, and a collapsible stock. \n\nAlso, just so you know, there is a difference between an assault *rifle* and an assault *weapon*. An assault rifle is actually a thing; it's a legal term that refers to machine guns capable of automatic fire. These were banned in 1986 except for the few that were grandfathered in, but the supply is so low that they're prohibitively expensive (a legit M-16 is about $25,000 and requires special approval from the ATF that takes months). 
I keep seeing people say "go Comm, the civilian jobs afterwards pay really well and are easy." I'm about to join and am in the job selecting stage right now. What Comm jobs do you recommend in terms of making bank after you separate? Heck, what do you even do in Comm jobs?
Thank you! It's extremely arrogant of all the people who keep saying "muh Republican congress didn't do its job because they didn't do exactly as Obama told them to."  \n\nThey never consider that the people who voted that Republican congress in did it so that Obama couldn't do whatever the hell he wanted, and that in that regard congress actually did do its job, which was to represent its voters. \n\nObama making comments like "Elections have consequences, and I won," and "I will act with or without congress. I have a pen, and I have a phone" is a real good way to guarantee that those who don't support him show up to vote for congressmen who promise to stop him. \n\nDemocrats will cheer their congressmen when they obstruct Trump. And hey, if enough democrats get voted in to be able to do that, then that isn't obstructionism, it's our system of checks and balances working. 
You'd be surprised. Video games may have saved us. I've seen so many people in my generation (I'm in my 20's) and younger get into shooting because they wanted to try out their favorite gun from Call of Duty.

Well fucking said!
Actually, if we're not careful, Georgia might actually become one. Atlanta is experiencing a tech boom right now that's drawing quite a few liberals from the west coast. 
If you become an ATC in the AF, but turn 31 before you leave, is it still possible to get a job with the FAA as an ATC?
That goes against the narrative

Either way, it becoming a swing state at all is cause for concern. Same with Texas thanks to all the Californians moving to Austin and San Antonio. Unless Gen Z really is as conservative as people say, things could get bleak in the next decade or two.

I wasn't politically aware, but the stuff I've read seems like a dystopian horror novel. That being said, the soul of our gun rights won't be decided by people like you and me, it'll be decided by those who aren't already firmly pro-gun. She *was* a baby killing bitch, but calling her that only makes us look crazy to potential pro-gun people, and we need every ally we can get.
Also, don't buy a Taurus. \n\nGlock, Beretta, Ruger, Springfield, H&K, Walther, Sig, and Smith & Wesson all make excellent handguns. Off the top of my head, look at the Glock 19, Ruger SR9C, Springfield XD9, H&K VP9, Sig 320, and Smith&Wesson M&P9c. \n\nHold them all if you can, shoot them if you can. If you can't, dry fire then and ask the gun salesmen to show you have to test the trigger reset. Stick with 9mm, modern 9mm isn't underpowered compared to .45 or .40, it's cheaper to buy and your gun will hold more rounds than the same model in a different caliber. Good luck!

Down with the bourgeoisie! ☭
Wow, that's amazing! Thanks so much, I'll definitely be putting that job on my list!
Lackluster price, but my favorite color is Bakelite... ☭
Can you link that Russian surplus gun bag?
I don't like your opinion of changing the 2nd, but I respect the hell out of you for acknowledging that as it is currently written, gun control is unconstitutional. So many anti-gun people try to twist and warp the Bill of Rights rather than legitimately and legally amending it. 
Thanks for taking the time to respond. What are some examples of those other jobs, and do they pay as well as ATC? Also, are you 100% on getting in with prior ATC experience if you're older than 31? The stuff I've read online seems to say that the only exception is if you are retired military ATC, and I'm only planning on doing one enlistment term.
So I just took my ASVAB, and my scores were as follows: M: 98, A: 98, G:97, E:98.\nWhat jobs should I look at that pay very well on the outside?
I'll look into it, thanks. Do you enjoy the work, or is it 40 hours of boredom? I'd rather do an interesting job 45 hours a week than a boring one for 40.

AIM recently had a security breach. My info was compromised, but they did the right thing and informed me and gave me a year of identity protection.

Good. As a cis-white-privileged ultra-conservative male scumbag, I believe that the 2nd amendment applies to gays, blacks, and liberals too. The right to self defense in inalienable and not contingent on lifestyle choices. 
Maryland, New Jersey, and New York all seem to be in a pissing contest of who can be the new California. A guy got arrested in Jersey a couple of years ago for having a flintlock pistol. The charges were eventually dropped, but still.

You know that 99% of people can't legally get automatic weapons, right? Not trying to be pedantic, genuinely curious. 
I hope not. Civil war is a horrible scenario, regardless of your political leanings. But let's be honest, if it came to civil war, the side with all the guns is gonna win, and that's overwhelmingly the conservative demographic. 
Also, what are some examples of those comm jobs? Sorry for all the questions 
It's all over /r/progun. You should read the dissenting opinion of the one judge who actually cares about the constitution

I'll try to be respectful as possible, but Obama did not take the high road. When he entered office he infamously said "Elections have consequences, and I won." Then when Republicans took back Congress and represented the people who voted them in (yes, they were voted in, and yes, those who voted them in *wanted* them to block Obama politically), Obama said "I will act with or without Congress. I have a pen, and I have a phone." Regardless of your political leanings, those are not the words of someone extending an olive branch to the opposition.

Thank you so much for the guidance. I really appreciate it
Beautiful gun. I'm always awed by how great CZs look. Planning on getting my dad a Shadow for his retirement gift. 
He should read Era 2 before he reads Secret History.
Life, uh, finds a way.
That likely wouldn't fix the issue. Japan and South Korea are both countries with *very* strict gun control laws, and both countries still have extremely high rates of suicide. Confiscating guns of depressed people will simply lead to depressed people hiding their depression.

I respect the founding document of our country, you know, the one that says the right to keep and bear arms "shall not be infringed." Tell me more about how gun control doesn't violate that.
That ban really stopped the terrorists in November 2015, didn't it?
Forgotten Paris already, have you? (Yes, I know that there are guns in France, but not legal access to the ones used in the attack)
I actually have a masters, but it's in biomedical sciences. Would that be enough for the pay bump?
Definitely not medical. I'm joining to escape that haha. I have a masters in biomedical sciences and I'm a lab rat right now. Ideally a job that would translate really well to the civilian world and pay pretty well. I may end up going the full 20 in the AF, but I may not (and even if I do the full 20, I'd be getting out before I'm 50 (I'm 25), so I'd keep working) . Trying to hedge my bets right now. 
You got downvoted pretty hard, which is a shame. I'm the same way. Anime's style is just off putting to me (and to many people). Like it or not, the term "anime" has a certain stigma associated with it. Still, I think animation (maybe in the vein of The Clone Wars) would be the best way to faithfully translate Sanderson's works to the screen. 
So you're telling me that the Second Amendment exists so that the govt won't infringe upon its own right to arm its military? And by the way, "militia" and "military" are two different things. The US had a military at the time, it was called the continental army. A militia is composed of non-regular people who take up arms, not the standing army. Even IF the second amendment only applied to members of the militia and not to individuals, as a male registered for the draft I am part of the militia. Try again, hoplophobe. 
Far-right cis white male shitlord here. I was raised Southern Baptist in Mississippi (though I consider myself a Christian, not a baptist). I've literally never seen a church espouse hatred for the Jews. Not sure where you're getting your info from. 
This is fucking horrible. If you have to kill an animal (sometimes it unfortunately is necessary), do it as quickly as possible so it doesn't suffer. This is completely fucked up
Okay. Thanks for answering all of my questions!
I'm looking at ATC, but I'm 25 now, so I'd be 31 upon exit. Wouldn't that make me ineligible to be an ATC for the FAA?
Every fucking thread
Thanks for replying. I've actually looked into that one, but the issue is that I'm 25 now, and to work for the FAA as an ATC you must start before your 31st birthday. Since ATC have a 6 year enlistment requirement, it wouldn't be possible for me to be an ATC in the civilian world for the FAA, which is where the money is.
How likely is that though? Isn't Palace Chase luck of the draw?
> Why are you being down voted?\n\nThe real question here is, will liberals' childish behavior of downvoting every and single piece of dissent without at all providing a sound retort help promote their causes or improve their collective image?\n\n
Who spending more?\n\nIf parents spend tons of their own money to send kids to cram schools then yea, chances are it will yield positive results.\n\nIf government spend tons of others' money, then things will likely be worse.\n\nForm no child left behind to war on drugs to war on terror, when did government do a good, no scratch that, a decent, passable job?\n\nAnd BTW, if all kids in America are getting great grades, everyone is going to great colleges and graduating magna cum laude, do you think the government branch will be cut or they will receive more funding?\n\nSo is it in their best interest to do a great job, or do a lousy one, but not lousy enough to provoke a major reform from the congress?
Well if recycling are done in real world as well as in r/jokes
I doubt if country folks wanted to rename a drug they would give it lamb-chop... too unoriginal. Had been me I would go with "Canada flour".\n\n"Hey you wanna get high? Try some Canada flour."
>How is that bad for society? \n\n>government able to set prices on medication, medical supplies and procedures/hospital expenses. \n\n1. It's bad. Unbelievably bad. We did that in China. Did not work. W are still doing that now, result: doctor underpaid and had to scam patients to make a decent wage.\n\n2. Government wouldn't be able to. You can regulate the white market but you wouldn't be able to regulate the black market. Want a wild wild west that's impossible to control? That's your recipe.
What? And go down with the ship once it hits an iceberg??\n\nAnyway, any particular reason that I should keep stocking and stacking up?
Sorry for double dipping but I just couldn't get enough. \n\nYo Obama tapped so many phones, that he knows when Tay Tay will break up with her next boyfriend.

We need judge Dredd on this case. 
I know this is gonna be a total bro comment but I always envy vajayjay doctors. \n\nHell I'll never get enough of 8008s and vjjs. 
Libertarians are great at finding the sweet spot in the midst of idealism and pragmatic actions. Let's not kid ourselves, some of Trump's policies are against libertarian principles, but reducing juice to redundant government branches? Heck any libertarian can get on board.\n\nLiberals on the other hand always start off by childishly believing that they by default, don't have to deal with the conflicts between their ideals and the reality, that is, if they are smart enough to realize it is an issue in the first place. And then they go through some major redpilling in which case they simply  abandon one completely. \n\nThat's why you have Claire Underwood X 9000 which is Hilary Clinton, will say and do whatever to get elected, even if it means to go back on... or shall we say, "evolve" on certain issues.\n\nThat's also why you have morons like Bernie Sanders who believe Nordic countries are "Democratic Socialism". \n\nThe entire democratic party is a dangerous and volatile mix of extremely manipulative careerist politicians with no principle and low moral standards who seek nothing but their own personal gain and dimwitted, naive, easily manipulated idealist do-gooders with zero understanding of the objective reality. \n\n
But they are pagan gods! They aren't real!
How many layer of sarcasm are you on???\n\n
Not if you were an *outsider*.
> does not mean they are my enemy. \n\n50 bucks say they have no problem consider you an enemy.\n\n500 say they have no problem physically harm you if you go on a debate against them and the debate becomes too intense. 
I very much doubt he did. \n\nHe is but a simply lowly community organizer. Don't give him credits he does not deserve. \n\nI believe however, Clinton very much does have the capacity to pull it off. 
Yo let's start a "Obama tapped so many phones" train.\n\nMe first: Obama tapped so many phones, that he accidentally found out his daughter is going on secret pokemon go dates with Jaden Smith
"Did we do it? Oh we totally did. But the friend type of do it, not lovers type of do it. There's really, really nothing between us. Yea I got that sinking feeling where if I don't see him for one day I feel like a fish without water, but do I love him? Yes, friendly love, not lover's love, not love love. There was the period when I dream about him every night, but only because I'm a such BFF with him, not because I'm romantically involved with him, we are just friends ^friends ^^friends ^^^friends.
I'm too very much against neo-cons.  They are liberals in disguise. Conservatives/capitalists cut deals. Liberals cut throats. 
>Over 200 lbs\n\nMadame President Schumer + Vice MP Dunham.\n\nThe hot and heavy. 
Can someone please tell me what is going on?
>If this is their tactic of turning people against Trump then it's only working against them.\n\nLOL you are assuming a lot people visiting reddit aren't complete idiots. 
By assaulting them?
Well I'm no fan of Bush jr. but we all know how media impacted on him, which is... a second term?\n\nThe media will only drive contrarians which, whether you admit it or not, we all are to certain degree, into sympathizing if not liking the subject they are trying to demonize. \n\nYou keep shittalking someone, then people will place the bar really, really low, and then people will discover that the guy actually is a pleasant surprise and exceeded a lot of your expectations. \n\nOn the other hand, Obama was completely hyped up. - the higher your expectation goes, the more you will be disappointed. \n\nPsychology. 
Found the OCD.\n\nPlease tell me you work a technical job instead of the art field. 
Feminism isn't mainstream?\n\nWhich parallel universe did you come from?

I'll need the source on the part about assaulting dissidents. Under the explicit directive from Trump or Trump's cabinet. 
I want Ayn Rand as the 47th then.\n\nLet's see what happens when all the people who carries the world around on their shoulders stop ticking for a few days or two.\n\nLet's see who is more valuable. Construction contractors who stick their psychological face to buttcheeks so they can get more projects and get his employees paid, or culture study douchebags live with their parents until they are 45 and couldn't get a job better than Starbucks baristas (with apologies to diligent, hardworking baristas everywhere, we can't stay awake without you guys)\n\nLet's see who needs whom more.
>The long and short of it is, the wage gap is crap. Otherwise they'd be doing exactly what you're saying.\n\nOr it could be that capitalists go against their inherit behavioral pattern of maximizing profits — as some leftwing ideology suggests, for the ideological reason of oppressing and discriminating purposely against women — as some leftwing ideology suggests.\n\nAnd I totally don't see any contradiction. \n\nEdit: I was being sarcastic people. Gee, I don't like follow my comments with the "/s" pseudo tag, ok?
Yea that's all good and true but did you know that Obama funneled billions of dollars covertly or not so covertly into a slush fund that has the explicit purpose of fundamentally transform American culture and create racial tensions? 
Belle*
I mean this is the predominant mentality on the left. Stick a label on your forehead and bam! He finished his duty as judge and jury and will soon perform as an executioner. \n\nIn the side comic of r/jokes mocking Trump supporters there is a line "source?" I was with the comic about "do you need a safe space" and "triggered?" stuff and I thought yea, a lot Trump supporters do say shit like that but I lost completely at "Source?"\n\nC'mon, that should be the last thing to include in a comic mocking your opponent. It simply makes you look bad and gives your opponent ammo. \n\nAnd an even bigger problem is: old school liberals don't seem to mind people like that at all. 
>This is the type of "conservative" we don't need.\n\nHow the hell do you know he is a conservative? He might be a southern democrat. Look up his voting records and don't be surprised.\n\nBut in any case. Shall we promote more gun ownership? If the 2 poor gents from India were packing, things could have evened up a bit.\n\nOh yea, I know what people are thinking. "But waht if America had tighter gun laws?"\n\nThat would still not have stopped him from owning a legal firearm for illegal purposes. 
You don't need no exit at all. The suburbs as well as rural areas just need to let their voice be audible, they need to open up louder, and make ivory tower cucks understand how isolated they are and how detached from reality they have become. \n\nEven if you are talking about SF Bay, Palo Alto etc., the overwhelming majority of the tech scene are at least right on the economic issues. \n\nI have never once in my life heard anyone from the SV telling me or others that they enjoy paying taxes. There most definitely are morons who do, but statistically insignificant enough that it is possible you will never meet or even read one in your life time.\n\nOn the other hand, tons of engineers complain regularly on high state + federal taxes in California. I've read more than once that H1B visa holders or native workers working for facebook, google etc., considered themselves over-taxed. They straight up compare it to slavery. Some even say the American government is hollowing them out. They study for 20+ years, graduate with an M.A. or Ph.D and for what? To be office koolies. \n\nThe overall academic world is dominated by leftwing cultural Marxist goons, because they are always the loudest, and since their realm of studies are far, far less demanding than STEM majors, they have ample time to participate in campus activities as well as administration politics. If you dare to voice any opposition, you get shout down and worse, your whole academic life could be in serious jeopardy, there is a silent majority on CA campuses.\n\nDo they all support Trump? No. Are they all on the right? No. Are they sick and tired of the de facto fascist cultural domination? Hell yea. 
Or we can go on some exchange program and change him for his brother from Kenya. 
What's lefties' obsession with silencing opinions/facts they don't like?
>They would have to buy it on the blackmarket.\n\nLOL in which case, should he get away, will be a gazillion times more difficult to catch him. \n\n
>How quickly the forget their roots.\n\nThey don't. They fight hard to keep minorities on spiritual and mental plantations. 
> The same tired lines again. \n\nWell liberal cucks ain't known for that creativity. 
You can't believe how many leftwing brits I encounter in daily life or over the internet. It's like leftwing is the norm in Great Britain, those who support sjws? Leftwing. Those who speak out against them? Also leftwing. \n\nIf I care to ask, they always tell me they voted for the labor party in the last election, or really, the last 5, and have a huge boner for Jeremy Corbyn. \n\nAnd dont you dare to question comrade Corbyn. You'll get death stares. \n\nAgain, they are nice people, so I don't wanna speak my mind. A lady, in her 40s, 40s! Full of idealist childish beliefs, once asked me if I wanted to see Chinese to be more like American or more English.\n\nI wanted to say "more like 19th century or early 20th century English people, ambitious, careeristic and full of empire builders (ok that judgement maybe a bit dramatic but you get the idea)", but I knew she was a huge supporter for the labor party so I instead said American people.\n\nShe said "Why?" And she was actually kind of displeased, which is actually good, at least she isn't a complete internationalist dummy who doesn't care about her own country.\n\nI wanted to tell her the truth but held back.\n\nOh and Margaret Thatcher. I can't believe how they are still mellowing about her. Gee it's like 30? 40? Years and you still couldn't get over it?
Bots, and fucktard leftwing brits who desperately want to promote their leftwing drivel of books. 
"If you'd like to file a formal complaint, press 2"\n\n*Press 2*\n\n"You have pressed       two.     Please hold."\n\n*Music playing*\n\n\n♫ I've got the feeling that, somebody's watching me... and I got no privacy woooow ♫
You see, conservatives like you are still in denial, I'm a Chinese and I get a better grip of what liberals are these days than you.\n\nI know what you are thinking, "there's no way liberals hate some underlying, cornerstone beliefs and principles that I hold, freedom, fairness, the yearning for independence and self-reliance, a bit of frontier spirit etc."\n\nWell the truth is, while there undeniably are lots and lots of liberals who absolutely ARE all about that, there are a significant amount, if not the majority of them who don't agree with any of those things.\n\nGo to imgur, or democraticunerground, or WaPo comment section, try to explain to them what classical liberalism means, try to explain what passive freedom (the freedom from coercion) is, in the least confrontational tone possible. I guarantee you that you will be downvoted, to heck. \n\nMeanwhile a thread full of communist memes reaches front page of imgur occasionally.\n\nWhile you can argue it's a complete exaggeration that liberals all to varying degrees agree with socialists (actually it's not), it's not inaccurate at all if I tell you the dominant mentality, the current creed of the liberals are "My life sucks and it's not my fault/it's America's fault!"\n\nBut at least they enjoy being Americans, right?\n\nWell speaking out of personal experience: we have lots of Americans in my city. Believe me, most of them are English teachers, the liberal arts junkie kind, the downbeat l*ser kind. And EVERY SINGLE ONE of them is a liberal. Most of them don't enjoy being American, not at all. To what degree you may ask?\n\nWhenever you talk about Nordic welfare states, their eyes light up. No I'm not kidding, it's like that. Some swedes actually say well guess what? Our system isn't a free lunch at all, you need to pay a lot into the system in order to get served. Liberals? Oh boy you better not criticize them welfare states. Or they will give you the "OMG I can't believe you just say that" look. \n\nOh and Canada. The way they sneer at their own country while shamelessly suck up to Canada is simply disturbing. I mean granted if Canada is objectively better? Then I guess it's OK to sing praises? But by almost all metrics Canada is invariably worse. I love Canada, but to say Canada is better than America is simply untrue. \n\nSome of them even try to become Chinese citizens. No, seriously I'm not kidding. Again it's not wrong it's their freedom. And of course they always fail because 1. the immigration policy of China ensures that only rocket scientists and quantum physicists get the chance to get on a waiting list somewhere 2. China is like the direct opposite of liberalism: people are extremely realistic and pragmatic and people in general, despise slackers (even though we have ton of them but trust me, they are having a really, really bad time) so what do these liberals do? They complain. Same as always.\n\nAnd ever since Trump got elected, they become rabid. They are having a witch hunt, everyone is a Trump supporter, if you disagree with them. I know most conservatives are Cruz guys, and I'm not gonna lie, I'm not a huge fan of Cruz but I really like Chris Christie (judge me all you wanna) and now I don't even go to the bars I used to hangout anymore. You dare to drop a "Well you can't possibly disagree with everything he (Trump) says no matter how liberal you are" they dare to drop you, it's like that. Conversing with them make you realize they want to apologize to the entire humanity for America's electing Trump, and at certain points, they are ashamed of being Americans. \n\n
> Sure, things got corrupted to shit later on but even I have to admit that the basis for all this is good and many of modern western morals derive from it.\n\nI completely agree.  Self-sacrifice for example is one pillar of Christianity, even thought not many Christians live up to that 100%. \n\n
To be fair, it's twitter's server and it's their private property so they can pretty much do whatever they want.\n\nWhich ironically enough, is something liberals don't believe. 
Well I still dont know what alt-right is. But the right isn't dictated by racism or fascism or anything remotely similar. OTOH, liberals and radical feminists stemmed from the same thing. 
> I'm for taking more refugees, but I'm aware that it comes with a lot of challenges. But it's not something that countries do for fun, it's a humane act to help those in need. \n\nWell 2 things:\n\n" A lot of challenges". may be an understatement.\n\n"humane act to help those in need. ", there are tons of needy people around the world. Why refugees? How about fixing America's domestic problems first? Tons of Americans are in poverty and homeless. 
I dont mind that. C'mon I'm a rightwinger. Since when do rightwingers have a reputation for thin skins? \n\nDownvotes don't really mean no nothing. \n\nBad investments in futures and bonds however, is a complete different story lol.
I'm a rightwinger, thinking is what got me to the right side in the first place. \n\nAlso, I don't think anyone did a better job at painting the left poorly than the left themselves. The SJW movement alone takes the cake. Remember Antifa? 
> but the two-party false dichotomy we're currently locked in is almost as bad. \n\nAwwwwwwww but that's going to require us to collect information and do our own analysis! Sounds like a lot of work! Why can't we just have 2 parties and other 10 maybe 20 token ones! 
> enough money/profi\n\nHow do you mean by that? Funny I understand every single word but when put together I do not understand their collective meaning. 
Yes, but did you know that Obama funneled a great sum of money to a DOJ slush funds?
Not really, it's just that Christianity has gone through many substantial reforms to reach where it is today, while Islam still remains in the 7th century. 
But he still fails to meet the qualification of being black.
Actually form a personal perspective, I don't like that but that's the reality.\n\nI don't like that because dumb people don't really have a choice, it's their handicap.\n\nSo I try my best to seek out and fight pathological, emotional and under-informed liberals, not dumb ones. 
Lock them up!\n\nIn one ce... I mean duel ground!\n\nChoose your destiny! 
If you consider China or Japan or Singapore in terms of crime, EU is very much a failed state. I have yet to hear one friend went to Europe who didn't bring back tales of robbery, pocket-picking or scam.\n\nApples and oranges.\n\nAlso I take it that you are not someone who follow US affairs closely, as I, a foreigner know those cities you mentioned are blue/democrats dominant cities. \n\nThere are tons of red cities you can pick, but in general, cities are left lean while urban and rural areas are right lean. The latter sees much less crime for various reasons. 
Well I can write a whole book about it, but I'll just say one thing.\n\nName one socialist who doesn't want to get things done utilizing coercive force. Name just one.\n\nYour best counter argument is that there is no political party/government that doesn't utilize coercion. You can't deny that socialists don't want or reject coercion. 
> An easy look at your posts says you are in T_D, so not unfounded. You participate in the same system you claim is a liberal thing...\n\nWhat, echo chamber? Nah, you are gonna be a moron if you blame that on me since like I said, I don't mod them, and I already started a couple of fights there. I talk what I wanna talk. I did post in other sub though, a lot of them gets deleted and I subsequently get banned so what you are now able to see are the ones that survived, kind like evolution, your accusing me of "only participating in T_D " therefore I'm a huge fan of echo-chambering is like saying since the human biology is so complicated, there must be an intelligent designer. You are not reading the whole pic.\n\n> So, again. You continue to blame liberals for the same thing your friends and T_D do,\n\nWhat, echo chambering? I actually went back on my previous post and check. I didn't find any lines that may lead you to believe I made that accusation. Please provide a direct quote?\n\n>Idc about your upvote, this isn't a quid pro quo thing...\n\nI upvoted you again. Just to ruin your day. Take that upvote in your kisser. Pow! \n\n>Don't come here and say childish terms like 'libtards' and pretend you deserve upvotes for your harassing comments.\n\nWell clearly we are having a failure of communication. I said I don't care about the upvotes. I'm a rightwinger, since when do we have thin skins? We are accused of being shameless and sociopathic, indifferent all the time. What makes you think that I care about the number with a low-tech css coding behind it?\n\n>Don't like liberals, fine, don't come to a liberal subreddit.\n\nYou can ban me if you want? In which case you validate my accusation of liberals being insular? Under the pretext that liberals love to boast how super tolerant they are???\n\n>Just as an atheist shouldn't interrupt a church service and shout down the preacher.\n\nOMG I'm literally shaking... with laughter! You guys now realise the whole progressive movement is faith-based, that the moment you stop believing it, it dissolves?  Well color me surprised! \n\n>Go to r/politics if you want that. Not here.\n\nOh I got banned from r/politics alright.
>They are un-American.\n\nYou are putting it lightly.\n\nThey are anti-American. They are treasonous.\n\nThe people who spat on Vietnam vets returning home, whom did they vote for?\n\nThe actress who donned VC gears and mounted on NVA AA batteries, posed for NVA propaganda, what's her political alignment?\n\nWhich party had its members referred to Stalin lovingly as "Uncle Joe"?\n\nThe democrats are spiritual losers. They believe they are entitled to a great living handed to them by America/the American government. They believe in only an America shaped in their  image with their insane fantasies. \n\nIf they couldn't get their way, they'll act ever so childishly and find every possible ways to throw a tantrum. \n\nThey resent America. They hate America. 
> if that didn't redpill the shit out of people regarding illegals then they are hopeless.\n\nNever underestimate leftwing sheeple's ability to indulge themselves in kumbaya fantasies. 
> It was a metaphor.\n\nI didn't take it literally. I was poking fun at ya. \n\n
Who never uses Adobe Reader.
There was a time when I believed that America is unique and will immune to the falls and rises like other empires in history. \n\nI knew nothing about America back then.\n\nNow after a decent amount of understanding about America I still refuse to believe that but nevertheless I'm worried. \n\nAmerica can survive her fair share of fools (liberals/progressives) but it will be a real test on whether she can push through all the treason from within. \n\nYou now have an entire party, a political platform facilitating people who will be more than glad to see America being taken down a peg. You now have a party that will, in order to survive, do anything it can, even at the cost of sacrificing national interest. \n\nThe average liberals want more refugees because they are naive and believe they will help a lot of people. The democratic party want more refugees because they want a complete moral high ground which secures their speech hegemony, more racial conflicts, more conflicts if not more terrorist attacks which will inevitably direct more power into the already behemoth federal government. 
I'll be honest, I have WAY WAY more respect for Clinton than Obama.\n\nHillary fought up her party ladder tooth and nails. She literally got where she was stepping on the cracked skull of her defeated enemies.\n\nObama on the other hand, was rocketshipped to where he was. He was, and always will be a community organizer. He got lucky. He simply showed up at the right place, the right time in the right race.\n\nNo matter how much I disagree with McCain, Bernie Sanders, Jeb Bush or Hilary Clinton, I still respect them. I actually can't find nearly as much to disagree with Obama as Bernie, but I have no respect for the Big 0. \n\nNow I know some liberals lurking around reading this will say I'm just a racist with a yellow face but get this: all those who heavily influenced me, all those who wowed me seem to be black.I can give you a few example:\n\nThomas Sowell, the thinker that literally got me where I was, another being Milton Friedman but that's another story. \n\nRandal Pinkett, Phd, Oxford graduate, Rhodes scholarship, apprentice champion. Trump said he never saw anyone like him. I agree. I can't fathom anyone with that high a life & academic achievement. \n\nDon Thompson, CEO of McDonalds, Purdue graduate, was an Engineer before rising up to the CEO seat.\n\nHerman Cain. Born dirt poor, real rags to riches story. \n\n"Benny" Carson. Brain surgeon, real book nerd. Republican party is the party where slicky used car salesman style politician like Chris Christie (which I really like) and booky types like Carson can compete on the same platform. \n\nI'll take them over Obama any time of the day, any day of the month, any month of the year. \n\nSnap, I wrote another long diatribe. Sorry that I digressed. \n\nOh and Freeeeeeeeeeeedoooooooom! 
I get what you are saying. I don't think it's going to be solved by some sort of wake up call or campaign. It takes some fundamental changes in culture, i.e. cultivate citizens from early on to be rational, reasonable and self-reliant. However America is the kind of country where that is near impossible, if you have opinion A, there will always be direct opposing view B, and C, D, E F... if you want to teach kids this way, there will always be people who want to give children a completely care-free childhood. It's a great thing really, and it's a curse. 
If I recall it correctly, >60% of journalists identify themselves as liberals while <30% identify as conservatives.\n\nYet people some how have this consensus that "reality" has a liberal bias.\n\nNope. 
It's tempting to think that it prompt them to be "suck-ups" to the government. \n\nHowever I think that's not the main reason. The matter of the fact is, government guaranteed salary simply ensures that those the academics are free from market scrutiny and commercial natural-selection. They can not only wander completely off from the reality without receiving any repercussion, they can fabric their own version of reality and be able to survive.\n\nIf a marketing director makes up market demands as he pleases, it's likely he will see his sales plummet. If a history professor make up or exaggerate facts, he can get away with it, and he can get a sizeable audience more than willing to buy what he sells.

Or the government that launched a "Humanitarian mission" in yogoslavia while ignored the Congo massacre, or the government that went to Iraq under false pretense. Or the government that monitored your facebook page and ask your teenage daughter to take off her shoes at the airport for security purpose. \n\nGovernments never tried to seek to inspire the people. Inspirational private citizens seek to inspire the people via all channels they can utilize. Sometimes these channels have something to do with the government.

To be fair, lots of Americans love Russia and have no problem with other Americans loving Russia. \n\nBut there are fundamental differences.\n\nSome love Russia because of her culture, her magnificent literature and armies of talent artists including some of the best classical composers ever graced humanity.\n\nSome Americans however, love Russia because she was once a test-bed for their miserably failed utopian fantasy, and some love Russia because she from time to time, seems to give America a hard time, which serves as a relief for their resentment against America, their own country.

> How about building from the bottom up? \n\nPlease employ more descriptive terms instead of melodramatic and general ones. I specifically made that clear, like a typical brain-dead liberal, you went right ahead down that drain.\n\nFirst of all, what is "bottom", what is "up"? I can pull 100 random liberals off the street, and I guarantee you not one of them will say the rich is somehow "superior" than the poor. So what is "up"? Who is at an upper position than who? I'll never understand liberal's obsession with money. You people don't ask how much one contributes to the society, how hard one worked to get where he is, out of thousands of possible attributes that can be used to size up a man, you pick income and income alone and put it inside a spread sheet can call it a day. \n\nLike most retarded liberals, I bet you too believe capitalism/free-marekt (which btw, America is not) is unfair. Yet you choose to measure one's worth solely based on his ability to gain in the market place. Don't you think it's... I don't know, unfair? I'm sure a fringe element of liberals, oh I don't know, like 0.001% still care about fairness?\n\nDon't you think if a brick layer makes the same as a professor, and got taxed the same is kind of unfair?\n\nBut just to entertain your delusion: America IS building from bottom up. America is doing the best from bottom up. As early as 1980s, 60% of the wealth created were used to pay wages and salaries. We can only imagine today's figure will be larger because you liberals did such a fine job in shaping America in your vision. \n\nIn America, under most cases, and I do emphasize it must be "most cases" as no society can avoid anecdotal, statistically meaningless individual cases, if you want to go "up", if you are willing to work for it and work hard, you'll get where you will go, or at least, close, very close.\n\nTake the SAT for example, a lot of my former classmates in high school landed perfect score. Note that English wasn't their first language. The SAT test, esp. the math and science section, is unbelievably easy to us. Acing SAT with perfect score will get you nowhere in China because our college entrance test is at least double the difficulty, because we have a large population, and very few schools, so you have to set the bar ridiculously high. In other words, due to the underdevelopment of China's education system, a lot of UCLA worthy kids are working in KFCs because the competition is ridiculously heated. In America, UCLA worthy kids are working in KFCs because they squandered their youth playing street hockey or video games, or really don't have a plan for their life at all.\n\nSo what about America's education system? Let's not kid ourselves. Those who under-performed in life, those deadbeat, self-pitying losers you see populating a major part of the liberals/progressives, made a conscious decision to be under-achievers. America's scholarship, by amount and the number of recipients, are among the top countries if not the best. In America, as long as you work hard, as long as you have an average IQ, you will go places, again, save for a few special cases that is statistically insignificant and would make you not at all creditable if you choose to chew on them. \n\nWhy are there still poor people, why are there still college graduates knee deep in debt? Why are there educated people buried in financial ruins?\n\nTo explain that would require writing a book. But I can pick one of the many reasons and \nelaborate a little. \n\nAmerican's view on education as well as the reality of the world, esp. those of the liberals, are completely detached from reality. Tons of liberals go to college to "learn what I love", then 4 years later they curse into the sky against the evil of capitalism because their gender study diploma is completely useless in the job market. Most people here in Asia study what is useful, those who go for less applicable majors are prepared about the outcome. They go anyway because they truly love what they will learn and they do not care about financial rewards. \n\nI can tell you a real story, about a friend of mine who was born and raised in Texas. He worked hard, well, not really that hard. Asian kids often work 16 hours a day, he never quite worked longer than 8. He got a ticked to be on a program subsidized by T.I., studied in Texas State Campus Austin, right after graduation, he found a job at Intel. From day one he got into college, to the day he got recruited by Intel, he didn't pay a dime. LITERALLY. T.I. payed everything including his accommodation, hoping kids, most kids anyway, like him will end up working for T.I. And when they choose not to, T.I. didn't ask anything for return. You are thinking, he must be a huge supporter for capitalism? Quite the opposite, I met him at one of those forums for debating political affairs. He was a huge liberal, and he is no longer one now, I did not convert him, I influenced him. This is America, if you are willing to put up a fight, you will get a chance to shine. \n\nBut none of that is going to convince you. You will immediately bring up nordic countries. Let me go into that a bit.\n\nTo start, Nordic countries are different from Nordic countries. Sweden for example, are not that rich to begin with. In Silicon valley, a software engineer with 8 years of experience asking for 120K a year is virtually everywhere. In Sweden or Finland, people will think he is insane. We have tons of experienced engineers from Sweden and Finland, with decades of experience working for 5K usd worth of monthly salary and happy as a clam. Note that China is very much a 3rd world country, the overall environment is hostile to westerners, yet they refuse to leave, because the tax is ridiculously high, they would end up making more with 5K salary than 8K domestic ones. By comparison, most Americans working in China are English teachers. They are also happy, because they can get paid the same as their old burger flipping job by working only 16 hours a week here. This is capitalism. If you are a rare talent, you can price more for your labor. \n\nNorway, Denmark etc. is a whole different story. Both countries are lightly populated and have rich resources. A great deal of their GDP is propped up by mining industries. If you want America to follow that model, easy. Try to get rid of at least half of America's population. \n\nBut taht is impossible. America is, as a lot of liberals totted, a nation of immigrants. America has the loosest immigration policy, by contrast, those nordic countries have the toughest, I'd say even tougher than Japan. To become a citizen, you are not only required to speak fluently their lanaguage, you are also required to conform to their culture identity. I know no less than 20 cases of my people I personally know who are now either a green card holder or a naturalized citizen, I have never heard or read one case, just one case of Chinese becoming a Danish all my life, not even in newspapers. \n\nA resource rich country + light population is a formula for an affluent population. To help you understand how few there are people in Norway: it is less than 1/10 the population of a single province of my country, the entire Norway has a population that is less than half of the population of Shanghai.\n\nThis is the kind of delusion you liberals hope to reenact in America. If Nordic models can get to you, then you might wanna consider Middle Eastern models. Qatar is currently the richest country in the world, with per cap gdp more than twice that of Norway's. \n\nOn the other hand, I'd recommend you to look into the HongKong/Singapore model. Neither country has an abundant  amount of natural resources, yet both are equally, if not richer than the US. How? Other than a diligent population that has a social norm of having zero tolerance for slackers, both countries benefited immensely from free-market capitalism. Hong Kong used to be the #1 trade hub of the world due to cold war, and arguably she still is. \n\nBut then again, I doubt that is possible to replicate in America, since both country has a relatively homogeneous population.

>80% overturn rate   \n\nOverturn rate is high because majority of cases decided at circuit courts are not overturned.

Why is it our responsibility to do so without ever stopping to make sure we are helping our people first, and then people who would embrace our country and our people?     \n\nI actually agree Saudis are cancer to the world. I also sympathize with the notation that we have to help our people first. I just don't understand why we can't help our people and help other people at same time. As for why it's our responsibility, we're only superpower left in the world. with great power comes great responsibility. We have 11 aircraft carriers patrolling world's oceans to remind the world of our power and ready to bomb any threats that threaten our prosperity. In my mind, helping refugees is just a relatively cheap way of further increase our influence by claiming moral leadership. United States could certainly ignore those refugees and let them die but then other countries would less incline to cooperate with us.\n\nYou know, we actually agree a lot more then I expected. I apologize for acting like a dick earlier. I've been extremely disappointed by pure incompetence shown by President Trump's administration during the past month. His mistakes are jeopardizing the mission of making america great again. People are now associating make america great again with toxic failures.\n\n\n\n\n\n

There's not such thing as chairman of china communist party after mao died.  That position was abolished out of deference to mao.  China has a dual state-party system.

President Trump is weak. \n\nAll China did was throw Trump a worthless trademark(to China) to stop his tandrum.

College isn't the key to success but it significantly increase the chance of a person becoming successful.
Reading through biography of Roman emperors, I found that none of them have college degrees. That make sense because university doesn't exist in antiquity. There are basically two ways of becoming an emperor in antiquity.\n\nOption 1: Your daddy was an emperor\nOption 2: Military service and ton of lucks.\n\nIn modern time, we have one more option: universities that provide upward mobility to poor or middle class kids.\n\nPresident Clinton and President Obama are both from middle class family. Going to ivy league colleges gave them a shot for the top job in the land. People often say that Bill Gate is a college dropout and he's successful! Bill Gate's daddy is one of the top lawyers in Washington state and his family is already wealthy. Warren Buffet's dad was a congressman from Nebraska. Successful people often downplay their family connection as explanation to why they're successful leading public to false conclusion as key to success. Having right parents is the key to success. \n\nFor poor or middle class kids who don't have rich parents, university provide a chance to level the playing field. \n\nBlue collar jobs such as electricians, hvac, or plumbing also could comfortable living. Young people downplay the risk of destroying their bodies after couple decades of hard physical labors.\n\nSuccessful life is up to each person, but I firmly believe having college degree make it easier.\n

Hunters are primary wildlife conservationists in the world. If you can't get them interested in saving those animals, they are doomed. 
Definitely there are a lot of corruption. AL governor appointed his sex scandal prosecutor to newly vacated Jeff Sessions' Senate seat so the governor can appoint a new prosecutor that's more lenient.
Elon Musk's businesses depended on the federal government's largesse, of course he will say/do anything to please Trump.
What town is that? To be honest, I'm surprised there are still white people who work as farm manual labors especially when there are much easier options in the city.  
People from /r/Columbus are actually fine with this order. 
It might be true those are good salary else where but we're talking about SF. I want to emphasize again, those are terrible salary in SF. You won't be able to start a family or buy a house. You'll have to find a roommate or two or three roommates to make it work. 
I can certainly agree with your view point.
Where can you find wholesalers?
Agree with you 100%.  However, it's very difficult to convince John Q. Public, politician's pay in hundreds of thousands are too low.  I wish there are better ways to increase their salary to attract people who aren't independently wealthy to run for seats. 
OK, Muslim Brotherhood I can see why some would want it label as terrorist organization. What did CAIR do to deserve the same label?

I love how you completely ignore threat of war with China while enjoying your peaceful relationship with Russia.  
If and a big if.  President Trump is a known liar. Everything he said can safely be assumed as a lie to distract from russiagate scandal.

See, this is kind of attitude why politics in this country is so polarized. You know nothing about your own country.

Only white people can be mentally ill.  Brown people will be called terrorists and black peopl thugs at this point.  
I've been finding the cult of personality around Musk strange. I also think he's an empty suit. 
I seriously doubt president trump is a billionaire. He's at most a millionaire.  
It's not a joke. That's the joke. Got it?
I'm not sure what kind of data you want. musk isnt exactly known to be nice to his  ex employees either.  You're not going to find full negative reviews.  Here's one data point.  Believe what you want.  You don't have to agree.  \n\nhttps://www.quora.com/Why-is-Tesla-Motors-pay-so-low

I agree. I worked with a Somali microbiologist. He's the hardest working person I know. Last I heard he's in medical school. My problem is that most people don't attempt to know people who are different from them. Real world is a larger version of high school clique, people only like to stick with people who are like them. However, I can understand why they're more comfortable with people who are like them.

The only reason why I'm saddened by this is because the gay bar I used to work at may close soon.\n\nNot because I miss the job but because my W2s are due soon.

Yep. My uber liberal sis started spouting those very same alternative facts at me.\n\nI member. 🍇 
I've seen it with my own eyes.
PM me for that one.
No kidding. NPR where I live brings his old ethics lawyer, Richard Painter, on because it fits their agenda. The ass kidding done to that man is so obnoxious that I'm waiting for the programming department to clear half an hour one day just so the announcers give him a sloppy yet noisy blowjob.\n\nRemember kiddies, Dubya's reputation consists of having one of the least ethical governments in modern history.

That was Google Folsom.\n\nAnd that was because none of them were Asian *muscle* bottoms. Their asses were flatter than the average of Brett Favre's caboose and the landscape of Lubbock, Texas.

The greatest gay masterpiece since Lady Windermere's Fan.
And layered. The man has an economics degree.
Thank you. It was an inside joke during my German class.
The gay narrative couldn't win that one at all.\n\nFact: He was a terrorist. Cut and dry.\n\nAlternative fact supported by gay media: He was raised by a homophobe. That supports a politician that claims to support LGBT rights but has a reputation to be a liar. Basically the Democrats' David Duke.
Exactly: real economics, folks. This past winter, inflation has increased a tad while folks' real wages haven't gone up. People are cutting back on their spending. Target's supply doesn't exactly meet demand; their more elastic/easily substituted merchandise (furniture, clothes, etc.) is hipster junk that's out of touch with people who live outside of Minneapolis, Williamsburg, and the West Coast. For example, I tried on their 2xl swim trunks. They couldn't get over my legs, meanwhile Walmart's may just be a bit tight in the ass (I squat, pedes). On the other hand, their elastic merchandise (day to days, groceries, etc) are ridiculously expensive. I remember seeing bread for like $3. I started shopping at Aldi for my groceries.\n\nBut point being you're right when it comes down to it- Target is doing this to try to redeem itself.
&gt;like I drink alcohol\n\n&gt;Wisconsin Flair\n\n1) Excuse your redundancy\n\n2) If you're within driving distance of Minneapolis or Green Bay hit me up. I love your states' dive bars.

Oh shit- I miss Colorado. Denver is such a dirty old cowtown but I made memories there. <3\n\nI used to also bounce at one of our (I assume you have a rainbow flag flair because I'm on mobile) bars out there.
Target is just shit. Shit products, shit management, shitty expensive. I have a 10% employee discount for the rest of her husband's life as a part of my mom's estate inheritance, and I don't even bother to shop there. Their virtue signaling is a plea for help to buy from an otherwise failing store.

>Yup, I want to see this on CNN and MSNBC. I want Rachel Maddow to interview George Bush, while giving him praises to high heaven.\n\nIf you think that is going to happen, I'm still waiting for the day that his ethics lawyer, Richard Painter (now law professor), gets a sloppy gay blowjob live on Minnesota Public Radio that would make a sleazy amateur pornhub video (complete with felching cream pie) look like a Southern fundamentalist fire and brimstone sermon on Easter Sunday.

No no no- that's MY noose. Gimme.
They misspelled Democrat.
Are those size sixteen pumps gurl?
Remember- Anon stating that they could face retaliation for leaking this info is the same reason why CNN says their "anonymous sources" give them their "news".  Always take it with a grain of salt because it could go 50-50.\n\nAlso, whatever came of the soul searching trend anyway?  I saw the NPR article, but that Anon said something else was to come out of it (a member of Trump's crew was supposed to be smeared, not his voters).
Right wing Tumblr exists and it's amazing.

Slightly relevant, but I've said it before on T_D and I'll say it again- the way that NPR has been treating his old ethics lawyer over the past year, I'm just straight up waiting for his sloppy live on air make up blowjob. The 180 is 1984.
Thank you to our vets, you guys are my heroes.\n\nAnd yes, you are heroes, because if you didn't volunteer... We would be forced to.\n\nThank you for being so brave.

What? He's a far right whacko. What is wrong with you?
He's doing okay so far. We'll see
Yes it's a job… But if they don't volunteer/apply for that job then there would be a draft and you or I would have to go.
What you saw was violence and a pathetic excuse for it.

Yeah I believed in him but I was skeptical of his existence from a young age. When I was 5 I wrote a letter to Santa demanding proof he is real and asked for a trimming of his beard. Sure enough on Christmas day I awoke with a nice hand-written note from Santa with a piece of his beard attached to it. That was proof enough and I was the coolest kid in kindergarten once I got back from winter break!\n\nDecades later after I got wise and stopped believing was it revealed that the beard wasn't actually Santa's beard. \n:(\n\nMy mother and I were talking about how she pulled it off when I got older. Turns out she was up half the night thinking of how to leave proof. That's when the family cat Whiskers walked by her. Whiskers just so happened to have a white furry belly... Couple of snips, a piece of tape and viola! Proof! \n\nWe still talk about it to this day as the greatest use of creativity to keep the spirit of Christmas going in our family!

I would say that I am not burned out on nursing just the awful hours I subjected myself to early in my career. Working three 12-hour night shifts7p-7a a week and picking up an extra shift every other week in a high acuity teaching hospital icu did it. I said screw it and jumped into travel nursing to pay off school (still).\n\nThat being said I feel like I put my time in at the bedside (6 years) and will be continuing education into anesthesia within the year. \n\nAs far as satisfaction? I love the science involved in the meds that I titrate and how it has an almost immediate effect on the patient. That and my time on night shift developed some great bonds with peers. We had some goooo times when the managers weren't around.

Whose to say either is the right option? This team needs a hell of a lot more than just a solid goaltender to dig them out of last place so which goalie preference is ultimately irrelevant.\nPickard has faced so many shots coming up through the minors I'm surprised he doesn't have PTSD. \nIf we lose either to the expansion draft I don't think this team would be worse off than they are now. \n

This. I moved down to DFW area and joined a very active and youthful parish. I met with the priest for some counseling one night and remarked about how upbeat and invigorated the community appeared as compared to my home town (Northwestern Pennsylvania). The priest acknowledged this and attributes it specifically being in  the bible belt around so many protestant brothers and sisters. Great and passioned group of believers down here regardless of schism!

I think it's a great write up. I personally don't think Sakic isn't the culprit of theses issues. I do think the organization needs to make a non-emotional pick for a front office man. \n\nSakic isn't as fortunate as Pierre LaCroix with the franchise riding the waves of the Eric Lindros trade.\n\nI think a fair appraisal to his ability was that he didn't trade away Duchesne or Landeskog on the over-hyped trade deadline. I'm sure his phone was ringing off the hook with offers to trade this or that for a song and he stood firm. I mean you know its hilarious when yahoo sports writes an article about how Sakic and Las Vegas ruined the trade deadline. The Isles offered him garbage and he said "Fuck off". He deserves a solid A grade for that.\n\nIt's my personal belief that Sakic is wearing the GM hat for another season. Believe it or not Pierre Lacroix has been [rumored](http://bleacherreport.com/articles/2690851-will-legendary-former-gm-pierre-lacroix-be-the-colorado-avalanches-savior) to be looking to jump back into a leadership role with the organization. That is if we want him back...\n\n

yeah you make a point, I didn't think about that. 
Using an old handbook is what I do. You need the new code book obviously for studying, but since the majority of the code doesn't change cycle to cycle, the old handbook works most of the time to clear of code confusion. 
If he wanted things to actually stick maybe he should have worked with congress to pass actual laws instead of signing guidelines and orders that can and are be swept away with the stroke of a pen. 
The Montana Wilderness Study Act of 1977 that lists the areas the legislator proposed eliminating from study says this: \n\n[In furtherance of the purposes of the Wilderness Act\n(78 Stat. 890; 16 U.S.C. 1132), the Secretary of Agriculture (hereinafter\nknown as the "Secretary") shall, within five years after the date\nof enactment of this Act, review certain lands designated by this\nsection, as to their suitability for preservation as wilderness, and report\nhis findings to the President, as follows:]\n(https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/STATUTE-91/pdf/STATUTE-91-Pg1243.pdf)\n\nAt a minimum they have had these sections of land under review for 35 years! If the forest service deems to designate the land as wilderness, then fine go ahead and do it. However, I'd wager that the real reason this study area has remained in limbo for so long is most of the areas of question don't actually meet the forest service's definition of a "wilderness", and certain powerful people within the agency don't want to give it up to loggers. 
I really don't understand this elitist Zinke hate ya'll seem to have. Zinke is a lot of things, but a rich, out-of-touch snob isn't one of them.

Hey man, can't you see we are trying to shit on the guy. Get out of here with your facts. 
We mainly use the 20volt DeWalt stuff at work, and it holds up pretty well. The only major issue I can think of is a drill motor going dead, but DeWalt replaced it with little hassle. We did start using those Milwaukee cordless M18 Hole Hawgs last year and they are pretty amazing. I can't imagine going back to dragging a cord around a house. 
The Cutler Hammer plug-on breakers is all we use at work these days. They might indeed be a fad, but you could still always use a normal pigtail CH breaker even if they ever discontinue making the plug-on ones. You can definitely get a cleaner looking panel without dealing with the neutral pigtail. Here is a recent panel I did with them: http://i.imgur.com/9uAXE2p.jpg
"The argument for this is that AFCIs are designed to protect the wiring of the circuit, if you don't protect the home run of the circuit, why protect the rest of it?"\n\nThe vast, **vast** majority of issues that occur in wiring happen in the panel or after the home run. The only thing the arc fault breaker is protecting within the home run is a possible series short from a misplaced screw/nail, and if the NEC is really worried about that kind of thing then they should mandate every circuit to have arc fault protection. I understand the furniture thing, but any good electrician knows how to place things in a way that they most likely not get covered.
Yes, it does seem highly suspicious, and a kinda dangerous game to play if they aren't really prepared to meet those deadlines.

That somehow a fetus isn't a human, but this magical in-between physical being that can be *aborted*, yet somehow you aren't really killing it even though it is no longer alive. I'm not even anti-abortion, but the mental hurdles the Left takes to justify abortion is absurd. 
Ya, it looks like it. 
haha, that is pretty fantastic! 
I have to say the thing that bothers me most about all this public lands stuff is this notion that somehow the federal government loves the land more than the local who live by it.
From what I remember during the time (around 2008), according to Mike Holt forum people the code change actually had nothing to do with safety. There was a lack of clarification within the code between crawl and basement, and rather than make the distinction, certain armchair electricians decided to just lump the two different spaces together, and thus make joist stapled Romex in crawls no longer permitted.
I just assumed they stopped making it that way since I haven't seen it in a long time. Stuff I see these days at the parts house just has a yellow stripe on the neutral. 
> Don't even ask me what you do if you ever want to remove a wire\n\nI'll tell you what you get to do. Untwist the whole damn thing! haha This was from a panel change out I did today. The rest of the panel didn't look much better (http://i.imgur.com/9MqtfVB.jpg). Somehow I got it all put back together without having to splice anything (http://i.imgur.com/46TR3ra.jpg).

I've used a 12 oz Eastwing for years, but recently upgraded to a 10 oz titanium Stiletto and I have to say it is pretty fantastic. Given all I hammer is the little plastic staple nails anything larger than 16 oz seems like overkill. 
Looks like something from Westworld.
Does it matter?
Tile heat is great as primary heat, but you'll probably have to keep the forced air vent closed if you want it to work as intended. Almost any house we install this in I inevitably get the call that their tile heat doesn't work and have to go shoot the the floor with the the termo gun to prove it works and explain to the customer how it will never turn on if the room is already up to temp. 
Metal box? Metal staples? What year is this???\n\nEdit:http://i.imgur.com/yyNww2w.png
Mostly likely tinned copper wire. I don't think aluminum fixture wire is a real thing (these days anyway). 
I like how someone obviously did a panel change out at one point, and didn't replace the shitty old transformer wire even though it is literally 3-inchesl away. Haha
How's the Klein 6-1 nut driver? I've been thinking of ordering one. I'd check one out in person, but none of the parts houses in my area seem to have one in stock.

So does the peanut butter.
Well perhaps it is different in Canada, but I still see solder splices in old houses (built in the 40's and 50's) all the time. My boss said they even still taught it when he did his apprenticeship back in the 70's. 
nah, I just left them labeled like that in the panel. I think it was old abandoned electric baseboard heat. They were just free floating in the old panel not hooked up to anything. 
I'm always a couple minutes late. I hate getting out of bed to much.... Luckily I work by myself 95% of the time so I never get called out for it!
I'm pretty sure if stranded wire was torqued down that much it would have snapped off the terminal. Which is a pro I guess?
Do they make anything like those today? They are actually kind of cool looking.

I see OP already decided to stir up some shit and call the local fire marshal, but I interpret the cord in the ceiling as being okay. \n\nTo start, \n\n1910.305(g)(1)(iv) **Unless specifically permitted otherwise in paragraph (g)(1)(ii) of this section**, flexible cords and cables may not be used:\n\nIn this section it says cord can not be used in ceilings  *1910.305(g)(1)(iv)(E) Where concealed behind building walls, ceilings, or floors;*\n\nHowever, **it is** specifically permitted otherwise in *1910.305(g)(1)(ii)(L) Temporary wiring as permitted in paragraph (a)(2) of this section.*\n\nThe cord you plan to run is temporary, and as such nothing in 1910.305(g) applies. The cord can be using in dropped ceiling so long as it is removed in 90-days. 
You are correct that the NEC is a guidelines/standards. However, if adopted by the state the NEC is in fact law. The AHJ is more like a judge, and interprets the law accordingly. 
lol
They probably just didn't have a 2-pole breakers so used two singles. The bigger issue is that is a Federal Pacific Electric Stab-Lok panel, and has a known history of cause fires. 
Interesting. We're there ever formal reports submitted to a President within regards to their findings as required in the original law?
Bay Ridge is like the Daly City equivalent, so the similar prices make sense. 
Yes, but only if done correctly. Each advancement in connection technology makes them more idiot proof at the expense of connection quality. If I have 100 guys working, each of which who was trained in different ways, I would make them all use Wagos because the chance of error when using them is small. If it is only me working I use wire nuts, because I know I'm using them the correct way. Wire nuts require extra steps, but most would agree are more secure (again when done correctly). Solder is even more secure, but requires numerous steps, each of which could introduce sources of failure if done incorrectly. 
Yep, those are awesome! I also keep a couple stain pens for wood accidents. (https://www.amazon.com/Minwax-63487000-Finish-Marker-Walnut/dp/B0000DI7ZI/ref=pd_bxgy_60_3?_encoding=UTF8&refRID=5XP92PCG71DJZ0S2MRK6&th=1) 
True this hypothetically may be, the fine would be dropped immediately before court. Also, I don't think you can ask a venue to supply a new outlet they legally are not required to have based on some made up situation, especially when a perfectly other legal option already exists.
Ya, you win. This is horrendous. 
I'm inclined to agree. There was definitely questionable breakers leaving the factory 10-15 years ago, but they have seemed to have worked out most the kinks. And while I still do occasionally see some legitimate nuisance tripping from equipment, a vast majority of the time it is from substandard wiring techniques. Also, I can honestly say the temperamental breakers have many times made aware future potential problems that a normal breaker wouldn't have cared about. As a whole, they probably have saved lives and property damage enough so to justify there additional cost. Now that said, I would say the code is overly strict not on there circuit requirement, but as to how they are implemented into the circuit. A put in place arc fault device similar to a  GFCI should absolutely be allowed as adequate circuit protection, and the exemption that allows for this but only if conduit/mc is ran to the first outlet is utter nonsense.     
Yep, that is what I was taught as well. 
ya, I know of the motor and water heater ones. Just never seen the lighting stuff.
I actually used to have Makita stuff years ago, but sold it all. They have since changed how they make the batteries, but it used to be the little motherboard chip inside the battery would drain one of the battery cells completely dead if you didn't use the battery for a while. You'd then go try to charge the battery and the battery would send a signal to the charger saying the battery was defective. If you tried to plug in the "dead" battery more than three times it would send a kill signal to the battery and brick it from ever being charged again. Anyway, I had this happen to so may batteries I finally got pissed off with the company and sold it all and switched to Bosch stuff. haha I know there ended up being a class action lawsuit over the whole thing, but never signed up to get on it.  
The NEC only states that a continuous load is "a load where the maximum current is expected to continue for 3 hours or more." It gives no hard line as to what is and is not considered a continuous load, it just must fit the definition. Lighting in a dwelling can certainly be on for longer than 3 hours, and up north it would not be unusual for lighting to stay on for 6 hours, 6 months of the year. Yes, the NEC mentions nothing of 80% limitation, but you very well know saying 80% max breaker load is the same as calculating wire loads at 125%. In fact the 80% breaker rating actually did exist prior to 2002, but was removed since the 125% wire load rating already accomplished the same thing. The old code prevision is probably why the 80% breaker loading "myth" started making the rounds among electricians, but the saying didn't die with the code removal. \n\nThe old pre-2002 code stated:\n*384-16. Overcurrent Protection (d) Continuous Load. The total load on any overcurrent device located in a panelboard shall not exceed 80 percent of its rating where, in normal operation, the load will continue for three hours or more.*
Capitalism is more a roller coaster through hell and heaven. 
Is there talks of rolling back the arc requirements? The head person at my last code update class seemed to think there were actually going to expand the requirement into bathroom and maybe even garages. 
You are correct, it is Congress's fault. I found the actual recommendation report done back in 1991. \n\nhttps://www.blm.gov/style/medialib/blm/mt/field_offices/billings/rmp.Par.91202.File.dat/1991%20Montana%20Statewide%20Wilderness%20Study%20Report_Volume%201_Statewide%20Overview.pdf\n\nThe Record of Decision States: \n*Based on our review of those studies, I have concluded that 173,499 acres within 15 study areas should be designated as part of the National Wilderness Preservation System and that 273,828 acres within 30 study areas should be released from wilderness study for uses other than wilderness. The acreage recommendations for each WSA, with which I concur, are listed in the following table. The Wilderness Study Report accompanying this decision includes, a detailed discussion of the recommendations and maps showing the boundaries of each area.*\n\n\n
True that. Me being a couple minutes late in the morning pales in comparison to the countless hours a week my fellow employees stand around BSing or looking at their phones.

The word helper must be a regional thing. I've never heard an apprentice called a helper in my area. 
Just curious, but why? Apart from how much easier the device screws thread in, I can't see any real upside. 
He should have used that super soft and small baby hand when he did so, to make them feel huge.
> They define it, but they also tell you when it applies in specific locations...commercial lighting, and many others.\n\nI guess I don't recall ever reading such a passage. Do you know where in the code it specifies such things?

Those lugs are sized to accommodate the appropriate wire size needed to satisfy the rating of the panel, so not sure why to would be switching them out?

Apparently it is just a Canada thing. I know when I think metal boxes in walls I just have [knob-and-tube flashbacks](http://www.websterelectric.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Knob-tube-wiring-michigan-Webster-400x266.png).
Obviously at some point the 80% statement got muddled, and somehow became for all loads and not just continuous because I hear it quoted all the time. I typically separate lighting and outlet circuits, so if I group circuits such that kitchen and living lights are together, I pretty much assume they will be on for extended duration and only load the breaker to 80%. I'm certainly not saying all residential lighting is continuous, but there are definitely times it can be. If I'm doing a lighting load for a home common area I literally do the same thing as you; I count the cans, multiply it by the max bulb wattage, and make sure that number is less than 80% of the break size. The NEC is pretty clear on the definition of continuous load, and if you as the electrician thinks the load meets that definition then the are obligated to abide by it, be it industrial, commercial, or residential. 
Yep, that is what I do these days. I keep my basic stuff in a roll up (http://i.imgur.com/6NcMbij.jpg http://i.imgur.com/KWmcLZH.jpg) and that works 50% of the time. Then I have three of those canvas tanker bags that I separate the rest of my shit into (Panel bag, Low volt Bag, everything else bag). Hell of a lot easier than carrying around some monster tool bag. I mean how often do you really need ALL your tools? Pretty much never.
Well not only without permit, but most states require insurance to do such work which I guarantee most don't have. I don't have much issue with it if you tell your employer, but doing it in secret is kinda shitty 
I actually work with a guy that proudly touts how he wakes up with his hands hurting every morning because of how tight he screws everything down....
Judging from the picture, it looks like you didn't have the wire correctly inserted into the wago. 
Old URD cable used to have a yellow neutral (http://i1153.photobucket.com/albums/p515/blackdog47/Mobile%20Uploads/image_zpsizajsr0z.jpg).
The disconnect is outside at the meter base. 
Maybe it is just a regional thing, but all the small shops I've worked for have supplied everything but basic hand tools. 
You are correct, Arc in panel, GFCI at first outlet. Also, if you look around you should be able to find a combo breaker that does both, this in generally the cheaper option. 
Sadly, I work with someone who does the drill chuck thing. He isn't allowed to make up panels anymore....
It is more the fact that the fixture probably won't be large enough to cover the large ass hole....

3 months from now they are going to give immigration priority to religious minorities when they open up the gates again. Right now no one gets to come in regardless of race or religion. The current ban as it stands is non-discriminatory.  
Since there is no way to know who and why they are doing it, you can either worry thinking it is something, or not worry thinking it is nothing.
I don't think coward is the right word for not wanting to sit in a room for 3 hours with people you hate you, and have them shitting on you the whole time.   
Incorrect, if you are a Alawi, Ismaili, or Shia Muslim you you would be considered a religious minority and thus put on the priority immigration list.  \n\n

You might consider an employment "contract" when they are hired.  Then at least it's clear and in writing what you expect of them.

The no named characters bit is unfortunate, seeing as how Magnus is really a fluffy model, especially as you're doing thousand sons anyways.

Personally, though, I still advocate the raptor/warp talons as a bodyguard for your exalted sorcerers, especially the warp talons; a 3+/3++ once your sorcerer just gets Focus off, they pack a punch or 10 in melee, you'll wreck damn near anything you charge them into, plus your opponent has to pick between shooting them or shooting at the jump terminators.

Scaled safety net that provides assistance in an inverse proportion to a household's income, as opposed to the bullshit all or nothing system that exists in the OP's example.  In the OP's example under my conceptual idea, if their current income is the max to receive $400/month, a raise of $1 which should give them approximately an extra $125/month in income or so once you figure in taxes which in turn should lower the child care assistance provided by approximately $100 or maybe even a lower amount, like say $50 or so, so that the scaling is more gradual.\n\nWe'll never fully get rid of the safety net, its ingrained into our system too much, but that doesn't mean we can't use what we have now to make it possible to wean people off of government assistance as their income improves.

Seems to me his campaign was more about provoking outrage and convincing voters they were in a failed post-apocalyptic nation.  The irony, I think, is that we've seen from two major political occurrences so far that the narrative 'if you do X hell will break lose, so do Y instead' often backfires by causing moderates or undecided voters to vote for X anyways.\n\nExhibit A: Brexit.  The anti-Brexit tactic was telling British voters, "if you vote to leave the EU, your economy will collapse and you'll be isolated from trade and you will all lose your jobs."  Even President Obama told the UK's voters that they needed to stay in the EU to avoid disaster.  The message from the pro Brexit group was more around often unrealistic promises about the benefits of leaving the EU.  What happens?  Brexit wins.\n\nExhibit B: Our last election.  The media, the Democrats, everyone was telling undecided voters that if they vote Trump it would be absolute doom and gloom for the United States, while Trump continued to do things to provoke that outrage amongst the left while promising voters things that were also unrealistic, but were positive.  What happens: Trump wins.\n\nHonestly, the best conclusion I can draw from this is that making crazy unrealistic promises, no matter how easy to disprove and deconstruct they are, are what wins, and hysterical doom-mongering and outrage either drive undecided voters to remain undecided or drives them to the side that is making promises rather than threats.\n\nTest case 3 is the upcoming French elections: Marie Le Pen is currently the target of outrage and doom-mongering, as she's being compared to Trump and is called the herald of fascism in France.  And yet she's currently ahead in the polls.  I'll be watching to see how much further doom-mongering falls on her, and what the end results end up being; if she wins, well, chalk up one more victory for 'doom-mongering backfires' hypothesis.
I'm curious; in the US, there was quite the uproar over the FBI speaking publicly about the investigation into Hillary Clinton's email server, on the basis that it was unduly interfering in the election.\n\nYet, here in the EU, to an outside observer like myself, it looks like the EU is reaching in during a national election and interfering in a similar fashion, both from attacking Le Pen's wallet over the EU funds before a formal investigation and now this lifting of immunity from prosecution over violent image laws.  Is there just not a concern over an organization like the EU directly interfering in the politics of one of its member nations?  Or is it ok in this case because of the political leanings of the party Le Pen leads?
I said this over on /r/cyclopswasright when we were discussing the current state of this new Cyclops, but to boil it down, I don't consider this kid to actually be Cyclops.\n\nCyclops was a character who lost his parents to an accident, lost his brother to the foster system, lost his self confidence and control when he couldn't control his powers since they first manifested, and it took being taken under Xavier's wing for him to find a new family and to find a new purpose.  He lost everything, including his humanity, which meant that when it came to the X-Men he more than anyone else went all in, which is how he ended up becoming the leader.\n\nThis new kid gets yanked into the future under false pretenses (though, ironically, the mutant genocide that Beast used to justify bringing the o5 to the present is happening, just not in the way he expected), within a week runs into his long lost brother Havoc and starts high-fiving him, not long after meets his thought-to-be-dead father and then abandons his team to go running around in space with him.\n\nSooooo we're taking the tragic backstory of Cyclops that defined him as a character, setting the clock to before seeing the love of his life die, be possessed by a cosmic entity, and then die a few more times, and on top of that fixing all the tragedy of his backstory, aaaaaaaand what do we have here?  Just some kid that can shoot beams from his eyes?  Sorry, but this kid isn't Cyclops, this is just, like, Eyebeam Boy or some shit.
I've got an idea for a secret riffing off this concept:\n\nThat cyborg Thor from the original Civil War that killed Goliath and did some dicking around with the Dark Avengers, goes by Ragnarok?  That's who this unworthy Thor is; the real Thor has been dead since Fear Itself, and it was Ragnarok who emerged in the epilogue, confused as to his identity, taking up the persona of Thor because that's who everyone thought he was.  So what did Nick Fury tell to him to make him unworthy?  "You're not the real Thor."  Boom, his confidence is shattered, doubt pierces his heart like an arrow, and Mjolnir abandons him.\n\nHowever, Ragnarok has lifted other Mjolnirs before, so the idea of him acquiring the one from the Ultimate Universe and being able to use it is more than within the realm of possibility.
Plus, even KNOWING California was a blue state and Trump having not put any effort into California, Clinton only got 66% of the popular vote in California.  Granted, that's still a substantial win, but there were 2 million+ votes for Trump that effectively did not count in determining who got California's 55 electoral votes.  If there was a popular vote, you could be damn sure candidates would be playing to the middle and voters for the opposing party in traditionally blue or red states would come out of the woodwork.  \n\nBut that isn't the case, and President Obama who had the majorities, the public opinion, and the momentum to create an amendment to turn it into a popular vote didn't even TRY.   He could have pointed to the Bush/Gore race and justified it EASILY, but it wasn't even brought up as an option, as a potential policy platform.  Do you know why that is?  Because the electoral system actually FAVORS the democrats.  So many of the biggest electoral vote states are all so deep blue they'd beat Kasparov at chess; their paths to victory by default are shorter than they are for Republicans who have to get all the rural states, then fight tooth and nail for every swing state, with population trends that are pushing traditionally red states like Georgia towards becoming swing states!  
If we're still talking GvG, you have 1 or 2 drop minions like [[Mechwarper]] [[Snowchugger]] [[Shielded Minibot]] [[Annoy-o-Tron]] and [[Spider Tank]] (usually only played for 2 mana with a Mechwarper); GvG was a paradise for aggro.  Turn 2, Mechwarper, coin, mechwarper, vomit your hand of all mechs was a thing that happened.  Hell, it was one of the earliest instances of Aggro Mage, known then as Mech Mage.\n\nHis point stands; people would pick 5x GvG and dominate the brawl.
Get that bitch Saint Celestine.  Bitches love Saint Celestine.
Didn't happen here, we actually have a steadily growing league at our GW shop.  The plastic 30k kits sell like hotcakes as a result.

Probably because an unacceptable amount of it would have been spent putting up signs saying "Paid for by the Clinton Reinvestment Act!"
That's ridiculous. Then sell everything you own and give it to others. If you don't do that, you have a line.
You'd think not, but I worked in gun retail for a bit and did some research on the more extreme end of the conceal/carry culture out of curiosity, and you have prominent loud folks there proclaiming that unless you carry 3 guns (primary, backup, and ankle holster) and several magazines of ammo for each you aren't prepared.  Yes, they treat a self defense situation as a full on firefight.  I hear 120 rounds, and if you ask me many in the conceal/carry culture think that's mild, especially if he was only carrying one gun.
Ok, let me give you the full rundown of my dozen or so games with the Thousand Sons thus far.\n\n1) Mix your psychic powers.  You won't be getting psychic focus, but you don't have to choose powers 'til after you get at least an idea of what your opponent is running, so adjust accordingly.\n\nHeretech-your bread and butter for dealing with vehicles.  auto hullpoint damage, haywire out the wazoo, etc.\n\nTelepathy-psychic shriek removes the jink and cover problems; most models that can get the 2+ cover save don't have invuln saves.  Go ahead and roll, keep invis, for everything else keep psychic shriek and laugh derisively.\n\ntzeentch-you have to roll at least once, there's no BAD powers per se.  Roll your tzeentch power first though and adjust accordingly.\n\nbiomancy-you want some buffs, because you want to give your squads the +1 to their invul save.\n\nMOST IMPORTANTLY-track which of your sorcerers and sergeants have what powers, and realize that one of the most important aspects of your army is how you distribute your psykers AFTER you've rolled for them.  Spread out your heretech powers to make sure every squad has some haywire or other such anti-tank.\n\n2) What you have so far is actually not too terrible, all things considered, for what you're trying to go for.  The Thousand Sons are ALWAYS going to be an elite army no matter what you go for, so just embrace that.  Go ahead and roll with a Combined Arms detachment, and follow these simple instructions:\n\n-Warp Talons/raptors with the MoT make an excellent bodyguard for Disk Sorcerers.  They give you a mobility that the Thousand Sons often do not have, and a fast CC force that typically we need an artifact for.\n\n-The Astral Grimoire is your bread and butter.  Give it to a terminator lord, stick him in a terminator squad, as even regular terminators with the MoT are clutch, and run wild.  Between them and your raptor squad, suddenly you have TWO fast threats moving up the field, which is enough to catch your opponent off guard.\n\n-Magnus.  You have Magnus.  Take him.\n\n-2 rhino squads, even 5 man squads, in a Combined Arms detachment are clutch.  Make 'em rubric squads if you want, but regular chaos marine squads also suffice, you need objective holders.\n\nWith this army set up, you have 5 mobile units that are going to bumrush the enemy.  2 rhino squads, magnus the red, a astral grimoire termie squad, and a raptor/warp talon squad with some sorcerers inside.  Use your mobility, and hit the opponent in the flank.  Soar high with Magnus and rain psychic hellfire down on the opponent and MAKE them react to Magnus, let him be your giant 650 point distraction carnifex while the rest of our army singles out and destroys the opponent piecemeal.  Yeah, you're fragile with a model count of 20ish, but there is hope in what you have to at the very least have fun.  Presuming an exalted sorcerer and a terminator sorcerer, with magnus, you're probably looking at 10 psychic dice, which is far more than most armies have.
Are you kidding?  I loved it, specifically because I knew it wasn't Spider-Man.  It was a series that was about Doc Oc trying to be Spider-Man, trying to be BETTER than Spider-Man, and watching it fail brilliantly.  He had MINIONS.  A super hero, with MINIONS.  Its exactly what super villians that try to be good guys do, and it was amazing to see it play out!
There's the argument that perhaps the Supreme Court decision is a battle that Trump isn't wanting to put too much effort into.  Right now, he's doing a full court press with executive orders, and he's in a constant running gun battle with the media over busts of MLK and inauguration attendance sizes.  Maybe, and perhaps I'm reaching a bit here, the Supreme Court nominee is a battle where he'd rather take an easy win that no one will fight him on rather than open up yet another front to an already ugly set of political conflicts.  No matter who he picks, Republicans get to pronounce their victory of not having to even consider Obama's choice, the supreme court gets the vacancy filled, its as much of a win-win as you can get in that mess.  So rather than picking a fight by nominating a hard right winger like Pryor, he goes for someone the Democrats won't object to like what happened with the Mattis nomination, everyone leaves happy, and he can focus his attention on the next set of executive orders about immigration and refugees which will surely turn into another ugly mess.
Being slapped by a $700 tax this year when I lost my job in january of 2016, not finding a job in my field for 3 months, and then having to wait for 3 months for coverage from my new job while all the while not being able to afford the astronomical premiums from the ACA or from COBRA is what cemented me solidly as a conservative for life.  The ACA does nothing but kick people when they're down.
Given the prevalence of shaman and rogue, that might actually be a great idea.
Independent characters attached to a unit are part of the unit for anything that applies to the unit, such as the Astral Grimoire's ability.  In the case of the Astral Grimoire, this is indicating that you can either 1) have a character give himself jump, such as if you had some solo dick-kicking beast of a character, 2) give the unit the character is attached to jump, which in turn gives him jump, or 3) gives another friendly unit and all its attached characters nearby jump.
The worst part is that the university is only 2% black, 15% minorities, its whiter than some private universities.  That class must be full of a bunch of self-hating students and SJWs looking for an echo chamber.
A single culexus assassin would outright eat his army.  Take some aoe firepower like thunderfire cannons and whirlwinds to handle the horror spam, some tacticals to pump bolter shells into the remnants, and let the culexus go on a merry romp through his daemon princes.
The urge to make a birth certificate joke... its too much.\n\n---------------\n\nWell to be the US President you also have to have been born in the US, but that didn't stop Obama before!\n\n----------\n\nSorry, sorry, I know, but the joke had to be told.

Always nice to see an 8-0 ruling like this.  [Here's a link to the opinion](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/16pdf/15-497_p8k0.pdf)
To be fair, there was a man of Moroccan descent who had been arrested and considered a suspect at the time, before it was revealed by the authorities it was a mistake and he was actually a witness.  So, there was at least some (admittedly mistaken) facts to support people to jump on one bandwagon or another.
He's played by Don Cheadle, right?
The problem isn't broad support, both the Green and Libertarian candidates both were on the ballot nationwide, which already meets one of the criteria for being in the debates.  The problem is that requiring standing in the national polls is an impossible feat; the smaller parties lack the news media coverage that Democrats and Republicans receive, which makes it exceedingly difficult to gain traction in the accounted-for national polls which are run by the same organizations that provide said coverage, and given how elections center around the national debates to act as goalposts for public opinion if minor parties don't get into the debates right away they're effectively out of the race, which has demonstrably happened election after election.\n\nOn top of that, the CPD is a bipartisan organization run by Republicans and Democrats when the law dictates that it is supposed to be strictly a nonpartisan organization, and the judge found there was sufficient evidence in the Plaintiff's case to support that argument if you actually bothered to read the ruling, specifically Judge Chutkan's order.  \n\nThe long and short of it is, we've become a nigh-disfunctional two-party system in part because our election process has allowed this bipartisan shitshow to take root, most glaringly in the FEC and the CPD, and even moreso in the news media which has propagated this bipartisanship, and its only perpetuated by this idea that the same news media organizations which are supporting and spinning the narrative around a bipartisan system are used as the measures of public opinion which determine whether a candidate can enter the holy grail of the presidential debate.\n\nIts a freaking catch-22.  Third party candidates virtually can't meet the 15% public opinion threshold or be from the two major parties with exponentially more resources without the coverage and attention the presidential debates provide.\n\nFurthermore, your arguments regarding more than 2 candidates in a debate degrading the format is a joke, given how often primary debates include more than two candidates, with that number being whittled down only later in the primaries, and there isn't a complaint about the number of candidates then.  \n\nNational support comes hand in hand with being given due attention and consideration.  The FEC and the CPD serve as an obstruction to said attention and consideration, which is how the judge ruled it.
Yeah, let me tell you, keeping new mutants from being shot on the spot by police when their powers first activate and freeing them from the authorities for the crime of being a mutant really are the acts of pure evil.
Yeeech.  I'll have to double check the card to see how it effects brotherhood of psykers, I think you only roll once for the unit.  Thousand sons, depending on your army setup, its possible to have half your army be psykers you cram into a few small deathstars; this card absolutely devastated me when I drew it, while my opponents one level 2 runepriest wasn't even on the table.
The EU as strictly a free trade bloc the US could negotiate with so our businesses could better work with the many countries within that trade union was good for us, and simply binding them all together in a free trade network was all that was really needed to prevent another pan-European war, as hypothetically any country whose economy was tied so deeply to its neighbors who tried to wage war would get hit by a massive economic backlash as a result.\n\nThe EU now, with its forcible progression into a super-nation, with an increasingly politicized leadership who have made member countries economic pariahs to make an example of them (Greece and Cyprus as examples) and a hilariously ineffective crisis management apparatus (see the Greek fiscal crisis, the refugee crisis, etc) makes it a very unreliable partner to interact with or do business with on the global stage.  The EU currently is proving hilariously ineffective at countering anything the Russians are doing, and it was just during the Obama presidency's second term that there were leaked cables about how US ambassadors had basically given up working with its European partners in trying to resolve the Ukraine civil war.
But where is the bottom?  Do I have to go over the edge of the world to find it?
Not that Cyclops.  That kid is not Cyclops.  He stopped being Cyclops the minute current timeline Beast drew him into the future under false pretenses.  Right Cyclops is an orphan who grew up losing his parents, having his brother torn away from him by the cruel orphanage system, and ultimately being adopted into the X-Men to become the quintessential X-Men member because he had to throw everything into the team to rebuild a family he never thought he'd have again, only to see his new family one by one die, sometimes repeatedly, turn against him, or become twisted into something no one could recognize (ie Angel/Archangel).\n\nThis kid gets yanked into the future, starts high fiving his thought long lost brother within a week, and within a few months fucks off to space to hang out with his super cool space pirate dad.  Soooooo we have kid Cyclops that's been magically fucking absolved of the pain of his past, with none of the burden of having been a leader and watching his adopted family suffer under his watch.  That's not Cyclops.  That's like, whiny bitch eyebeam boy or some shit.
The Texas situation is just an ugly mess.  Personally, I kinda agree with what Texas did with the birth certificate gender restriction, because chances are the overriding concern was to keep boys from competing in girls sports, which could expose them to a whole host of liability problems.  Lets face it, no parent really wants their girl to get grappled by a boy, whether the boy wants to be a girl or not.  This specific situation obviously causes a fair amount of problems with that policy, but to budge on that now risks opening the door wide enough for genetic males to start competing in girls events.  I'm sorry, but between Cross Country and Track alone where there are significant capability gaps, a boy competing in girls events has the potential to set state records for girls.  What happens then when a MtF trans sets a shotput or discus record?  Do we put an asterisk by their name?
I played both Banner Saga 1 and 2, they've been absolutely magnificent and a very fresh take on turn based strategy games; you're damn right I have no problem throwing money to a third game.
Well, see, what happened was they initially sent Beast over with a couple bags of burritos as an apology and a peace offering after Death of X, in the hopes he'd get the inhumans to agree to contain or shut down the other cloud, but then Beast ate all the burritos on the way there in the blackbird, and proceeded to claim he was there to solve the problem with SCIENCE!!!  Queue resulting war once said scientific solution proved nonexistent despite Beasts' proclamations otherwise.  And the resulting (second) intervention for Beast's out of control scientific endeavors that invariably end in disaster and his eating binges.
You know what, this is ridiculous.  I was following this story since it first hit reddit, and was specifically trying to avoid picking one side or the other waiting for the facts to come out; for a time there were articles that were mentioning someone from Morocco having been arrested, and it wasn't until a few hours later that things were being updated to state that the arrest was a mistake, and that the person was actually a witness.  All I was TRYING to say was that it wasn't outside of any realms of logic for people to presume it was a muslim terrorist attack, and someone who wasn't following every little strand of information could have missed some key details since lets face it most people weren't reading the articles and instead just the comment threads.  \n\nBut nooooooo, obviously I'm wrong for not jumping on the alt-right hate bandwagon and instead watching all this unfold without forming an opinion.  Alright.  Fuck me I guess.
There's nothing wrong with wanting a better world.  What's wrong is naively trusting that the world wants to be one group's version of 'better' at the expense of all others, and that all those opposing that chosen version of 'better' are wrong by default.  
Agreed, I was old enough to remember the recount battles that occurred in the first Bush election, that was ugly, but it really doesn't hold a candle to the shitstorm we're seeing on a daily basis now; hell, I was actually shocked there WEREN'T more recount battles this election, what ones there were mostly involved the Green Party doing their post-election fundraising.  Seems to me like once the Democrats folded, all the protests that got kick started mostly were against the boogeyman they thought Trump was going to be.  Hell, even the Democrats haven't made a serious push to end the Electoral College, and you'd think after Bush and now Trump that would be a central pillar of their platform.
Watch, within 2 years we'll be chock full to the brim with movies that feature a dangerously incompetent buffoon of a president causing some national crisis or another for a heroic liberal-type figure to save the nation from.
Well maybe if the news media spent more time talking about these important facts to consider when voting as opposed to how they were spending entire news cycles talking about the latest horrible racist thing Trump said, people would have been more informed.  Instead, we get those as bland afterthoughts in reports the same way we get bland mentions of stock markets going up and down, followed by dozens of experts and pundits dissecting Trump tweets.
I always throw on the extra stormbolter to my transports.  You're paying 5 points for effectively an extra terminator's worth of firepower; 4 shots at 24" after a rhino has disembarked its load is worth it.  I can't tell you how many 1 or 2 model units that survived a turn of rapid fire bolters have been gunned down by lucky stormbolter shots.
Train them all in intrigue, seed your rivals courts with your slutty ninja daughters, laugh derisively as your assassination plots against your targets become much easier or your daughters just go nuts with their own plots and leave your opponents' courts in shambles.

Subway attempted a counter-marketing strategy by advertising a 5 Defcon Footlong, but it didn't go over near as well.
I read an opinion piece on Politico that actually provides an interesting theory for the dynamic at play here.  Essentially, the hypothesis presented is that Spicer knows he's dealing out bullshit, the press knows he's dealing out bullshit, and Trump knows he's making Spicer deal out bullshit.  Trump is taking advantage of the fact that the press room is a focal point for the media's attention, and using it through Spicer to create drama and headlines around petty arguments to draw attention away from the other things he's doing, like issuing executive orders tearing down the legacy of the last administration.  So long as the media keeps chest-beating and crowing about running jokes like 'alternative facts' and busts of MLK, Trump is getting exactly what he wants, and he has no problem sending Spicer out there day after day to take that kind of verbal and social beatdown to deal out further bullshit so long as it keeps the media focused where Trump wants the media focused.
At which point the manipulation isn't on the number of employees or how many hours those employees are working, but instead behind the scenes in the accounting which is a battlefield for CPAs and the IRS to fight it out.  Creating disincentives for companies to grow or for them to have the most efficient number of workers on staff at any given point doesn't help anyone.
I live right near Happy Sushi, it is a dream come true.
Thank you for not being the only person to notice how much those two were overlapping on some topics.  People kept looking at me like I was insane when I pointed the similarities out.
So its along political lines then, as is probably to be expected.  Anyone who doesn't like her believe she's fair game because she's guilty of those anyways, and this most recent attack involving violent images is just one more thing she's guilty of.  Anyone who does side with her sees the EU as an establishment to be resisted, and the EU's actions against her just support that narrative.

A buddy of mine came up with the idea of using CMD-left, equating Macs to liberals.  I feel ctrl-left is more widely applicable.

Alright, so how much does that leave. $30 more a month? A dollar a day? Do you go out to restaurants? Netflix subscription? Cable? Coffee? Can you sell some things? I was in a lot of debt 5 years ago and clawed my way out. It's a painful process, but it's incredibly rewarding.
Phewf! I was totally worried about running into Trump while going to yoga class.
As mentalpopcorn said, probably either Gorsuch or Hardiman if he didn't want to start a fight over the nomination and instead was shooting for an easy victory.  Pryor is looking less and less likely the way I see it, even in the ways Trump has exhibited himself as a Republican in his nomination picks he tends towards fiscal conservative as opposed to religious conservative, making Pryor less likely than people think.\n\nRemember after the election, the media kept hovering over Guiliani, Bolton, and others of that hard right ilk thinking Trump was going to make his cabinet a Night of the Living GOP style nightmare, and we didn't get nearly as much of that as we thought.  If the pattern holds, I would think Pryor was right out.
An updated Sengoku would be absolutely lovely.  
Well, they did give Community a 6th season with millions of views...\n\nOnly to lose millions of dollars on it and other shows when they utterly failed to find a way to monetize their streaming service.  
I asked about this issue in /r/europe and specifically whether people were concerned about the EU's meddling in French elections given this and the demand for Le Pen to repay the EU for allegedly misused funds, despite no formal investigation having been finished yet.  As a result I was getting shouted down by people saying Le Pen deserved it and that the EU was above reproach.  I hope Le Pen wins, having 2 of the G10 withdrawing so close together oughta give the EU the wakeup call it needs that this cat and mouse game of how authoritarian it can be and how much of their member nations sovereignty actually remains is not acceptable.
Ah, yes, Bendis, who decides in Battle of the Atom to literally, and I mean literally in the truest sense of the word, have everyone stand around while the psychics there (young Jean Grey, Emma, and the Cuckoos) stand there and have a 'psychic battle'.  Which consists of them standing there until one by one the Cuckoos start dropping.  Cyclops even says, "Don't worry, we'll fight when the psychic people are done."  Except there's no fight afterwards.  Everyone just gets on their bikes and jets and hovercars and runs to the next set piece discussion.
Being secretly norse in Saxony once the BBB rolls in would be nice as well, have a great pagan uprising ^.^
Rolling for psychic powers.  Just getting Invisibility is a game changer.
Honestly, I have no idea.  But it was an entertaining series of gifs that I felt needed more attention, and given that it was at the least orchestrated to appear to be a fight between a user and mods, I figured there'd be an appreciative audience here.
Which is even more horrifying and probably explains most of the voiced concerns about men going into womens bathrooms.  Except the media rebranded it as an attack on transgendered people.
Yeah, after how much the God-Emperor was slandering the inquisition on astrateletweetica, its not surprising their funding is tied up in legislative hell.
Given everything Thanos has fought through, his immortality, etc, having him step up in this way makes a lot of sense, I mean the only real way to make him MORE threatening is to give him the power to destroy planets on a whim.\n\n... See, now I'm imagining an event where Thanos the Devourer shows up to eat the Earth as is his duty, all seeming lost until the Fantastic Four ride out in a surprise intervention to drive him away.
Well, until we get 'The Trumpcare Act', I think he'll be content with putting showmanship into his executive order signing

Sooooo you can throw an opponents empire into disarray by throttling their food production via long, painful blockades?  
I want the absolute minimum amount of time between release and my first opportunity to play a duke in Saxony who secretly remains a germanic pagan after the Karlings shits all over my front lawn to plot a generations-long revenge scheme, eventually throwing the corrupted empire of Francia into turmoil as the War of Saxon Liberation erupts.
Given Jeb Bush was hardly a contender in the primary, we're probably good on the Republican side.  The question is now whether Chelsea Clinton steps up to fill her parent's shoes, or if Hillary herself goes after an executive position in New York like she was rumored to be for a bit.
It would be interesting if a failed Jihad hit all the involved rulers with decadence, and was worth considerably more than a lost holy war.  Having found Muslim rulers hilariously easy to play, as decadence is virtually negligible as a drawback so long as you keep your ruler as the only landed member of his dynasty, something to ramp the difficulty up would be nice.  Hell, I'm shocked that Decadence isn't a slow ticking increase, like 1%/year or something.
Its like they learned nothing about what caused Trump to win the election.  They're still using the same rhetoric, still harping on the same talking points, and still alienating the Sanders supporting portion of their party by doubling down on their party establishment.  Its ridiculous.
Neigh way Jose.

So when negotiations fall apart liberals can look to this and say how strong Trudeau looked... :P
What benefit does she get out of returning the money and admitting guilt in that, though?  Her stance appeared to be taking a stand and saying 'prove it', at which point the EU then stripped her of her salary before any formal guilt could be proven.  \n\nWhether she did misuse the funds or not or not isn't what's at issue, just like whether Clinton's private email server illegally contained secure documents didn't matter, what was at issue was the public announcement and advertisement of the accusations, which again in the US was decried as unethical interference in a campaign.  So, again, does the EU attacking a presidential candidate during an election in this manner cause the same concern, or because she's in the National Front is she considered a fair target?  Again, this isn't about the accusations being credible or not; even discarding the EU funds issue as a loss that she had coming, this new incident of a committee within the EU exposing her to prosecution she normally wouldn't have been subject to is interference, especially if she's brought to trial for it before the election.
Christ, I'm not saying they're not wrong, I'm saying given how information was coming out its not that hard to understand how certain ideas gained traction over others.
Yep, and then after the election their media arm went all out referring to all white men as misogynists and racists, blaming them for Trump being elected, which probably drove even more of them away from the democrats.

Oh, yeah, I'm in total agreement with you, I'm just saying that 'self defense' and 'firefight in an urban warzone' seem to be one in the same to some people.
1) Post AvX, he didn't do anything that would be remotely terror-like while Bendis was writing him.    He was saving the new generation of mutants from being shot by cops and detained for being mutants, he protected humans who were caught in the fights when Dark Beast was sicking sentinels on his team, and he was making statements basically asserting mutant's rights to live and thrive.\n\n2) Dark Phoenix killed Professor X, AvX completely retconned what the Phoenix Force WAS and made it a separate entity.  Cyclops didn't go Dark Phoenix until the Avengers had knocked out all but Cyclops and Emma of the Phoenix Five, they went mad with power, and Xavier, a normal human in strength and stamina with the added benefits of telepathy, walked up to something that he should have known from experience was a cosmic force of destruction capable of wiping out solar systems and threatened to turn Cyclops into a vegetable.  Cyclops could have SNEEZED and accidentally killed Xavier.  Professor X's secrets destroyed the school and Cyclops' family, the Jean Grey school almost immediately started using its students in full scale assaults including on the Hellfire Club's villain school, after his X-Force was discovered and he disbanded Wolverine, then Cable and Storm, each made their own in turn.  His gamble was 'the Phoenix Force is coming back, I have a plan to channel it into something productive and non-destructive' which the Avengers immediately shit on, rejected, and made worse until Cyclops' ultimate plan to have Hope channel the Phoenix Force happened anyways.  And there was no 'letting' the Phoenix take over; the Phoenix Five happened by accident after Iron Man went on a bender and drunk drove a Phoenixbuster suit which failed epicly, while the Phoenix Five existed he tried to create world piece, provided free electricity, and generally tried to make productive changes.  Namor, Colossus, and Magik all went nuts for their own reasons, and it wasn't until Emma and Cyclops were each holding half of the power that they lost it, a situation that wouldn't have happened had the Avengers not intervened.  So no, its not easy to justify him as a bad guy.\n\n3) More like Kamala wasn't even super powered when all this went down, Miles Morales Spider-Man wasn't even in the same universe, and Captain America was an obstinate jackass from the beginning of AvX, and he didn't even lift a finger to help mutants or mutantkind beforehand, so of course he's going to paint Cyclops as the worst person ever after the fiasco that went down in AvX, because if he admits that Cyclops had a point, that would mean *gasp* Captain America wouldn't have the moral high ground!\n\n/r/cyclopswasright bitches.
True, but it and the articles it links to also state they'd found proof of those votes occurring, and the number cited was from a sample of just 8 municipalities in Virginia, with it being implied that further research was being hampered by political intervention.
Oh, don't get me wrong, I do think that it should be decided at the school district level, on at least a case by case basis, but realistically that's just not going to happen.  Eventually some case is going to stick through its way to the Supreme Court who'll hand down some sweeping ruling dictating how trans students need to be treated in school, and then it won't matter what our personal beliefs are.\n\nAll I was saying, though, was as many issues as a trans wrestler brings up, there are a whole mess of other sports where a guy transitioning to a girl or someone on testosterone competing in a girls event makes the entire occasion completely unfair, which means there really are no right answers.  
Honestly, I've found the sheer pants-shitting terror of opponents having to reorient their army to respond to a block of stormshield termies that typically are toughness five is hilarious.  Bait his eldar forwards to he leaves his wraithknights tucked safely in the backfield, drop and corner them with termies, watch your opponent panic and try to turn around, giving up the board control they just gained.  Add in grav-laden veteran squads in drop pods for shits and giggles, and you've got a three punch combo (ravenwing to match their speed, drop pods for the first punch to the face, termies for the hammerblow) that will cripple your opponent.

This sounds like a direct quote from an American circa 2007.
Basically.  Democrats are at their core globalists; they want to tear down borders, push down trade barriers, and unite the governments of the world into one big world government that they can use to project their ideals down on the entire world, because what's better than establishing a liberal regime in the United States?  Being the 'visionaries' that established a liberal regime over the world.  Its why they were so naively gung-ho about the Arab Spring before it turned into region-wide jihads and civil wars.  Its why they were so blindsided by Russia coming out swinging in Crimea, Ukraine, and Syria.  Ultimately, its why they reject Sanders and his supporters while at the same time despising Trump; they're not there to put Americans first, they only put their own agenda first.
I 100% agree, THIS is a proper dreadknight.
The last century good enough for you?
No sweat.  Its an odd little artifact, but that thing freaking makes the thousand sons work.  A scarab occult squad with attached sorcerers getting buffed with an astral grimoire, and you have a force that it almost a direct counter to a full on Wolfstar.  High strength force staffs, they're usually a 3+/3++ so ap doesn't matter, they can go nearly as fast as the wolfstar, a single use of force for instant death against those multiwound gribblies, and you're good.  Include a powerfist or something similar in case of a dreadnought, and you have an unbreakable brick to center your army around.

So what level of fear does the current populace have towards terrorism? If there's a law against inflating fear, I'm assuming there's a specific measure of acceptable fear towards terrorism.
That's exactly how you're supposed to feel.
Np. All good.
Define 'inflated'
It says right in the article.\n\n>An interesting number in the package was Consumer Credit, which is personal debt. This is debt from credit cards, personal lines of credit, auto loans, etc. – a.k.a. non-mortgage debt. This number rose $3 billion dollars, increasing household consumer credit to $569 billion. Roughly a 3.4% increase from the same time last year. This is actually the only debt indicator that slowed down in December, with an increase of 3.3% annualized. That’s right, Canadians owe more than one dollar in personal credit for every 3 dollars in mortgage debt.

She asked this same question and Bernie just looked like an idiot. Does she lower the wages of her workers so that she can afford to provide them insurance, or does she raise the rate on her costumers and push them to bigger corporate chains? Liberals will bash these mom and pop stores out of business, and it'll be the big corporations who can actually subsidize the loss until they can lobby the government to reduce the burden. Fast forward 10 years and we have less small businesses, larger corporations, and more lobbyists. Sounds regressive to me.

Stop. We do not need multiple threads on this. This makes us all look retarded.
If people will proudly declare that they won't do the right thing (pay), and then justify it by saying "there are no real consequences to not paying it, i simply don't." then I am well reasoned to be upset.\n\nTaxing higher earners is another issue entirely and I feel bringing it up is just a tactic to shift focus from unapologetic freeloaders.

I couldn't find anything on using this to justify the travel ban. Was this the quote you were extrapolating that from?\n\n“This is another senseless act of violence that cannot be tolerated,” White House spokesman Sean Spicer said. “It’s a terrible reminder of why we must remain vigilant and why the president is taking steps to be proactive rather than reactive when it comes to our nation’s safety and security.”
And if there's time, perhaps discuss NAFTA.
It doesn't seem too lore friendly.

That race started loooooong ago whether it's hiring illegals or outsourcing to countries with low cost labor.\n\nLet's make every business pay their workers $20 an hour, and force them to pay full benefits. If they can't make that work then we just laugh them off as a failure, right? /s\n\nThese business owners are trying to create jobs! That is excellent! The sad thing is that within that discourse with the salon owner, Bernie showed that he lumps people into two classes: business owners, and workers. Whether you're a multibillionaire businessman or a small franchise owner who can't even provide insurance for yourself, he is not on your side.
Can we define what a 'refugee' is? Because I think there's another term for people illegally crossing the border from a NATO ally, but I can't put my finger on it...
I'm scraping by, paying my premiums for my family, and I'M the douche bag??? \n\nHave you tried calling them to work things out? Do you have a budget? And yes, you are a freeloader. I'm sorry that the term offends you, but I can't think of a better definition of it than what you describe.
A lot of people 'feel' persecuted though.\n\nedit: Meaning that a lot of people 'feel' something, when it's not actually reality.
I apologize for coming across that way, but it seems you need to understand that what you're doing is hurting other people.\n\nYes, what you're describing is free loading. There will be a point in time when you need more out of the system then what you put in. Old people depend on the payments of younger people for the system to be sustainable. You don't start paying your premiums when you get cancer, it's all the payments before that diagnoses that pay for your treatment.
Which is why I continued on the conversation in the hopes of setting up a proper budget with the poster.

> And studies have shown refugees find their feet relatively quickly: A 2004 study indicates the vast majority of refugees‘ income is earned from employment, not social assistance, within seven years of their arrival in Canada. They sometimes perform better than business-class or family-class migrants.\n\nAre you reading the same thing as me? So it's after seven years that most of them have a job that 'sometimes' makes more than other immigrants?\n\nStop spreading fake news.\n\n
I think we can both agree that health insurance tied to employment is ridiculous. \n\nAnd for the record, I've never stated I'm against the minimum wage, only that if she had the opportunity to continue growing her company with the current wage structure, she could help a lot of unemployed individuals.\n\nThough many may not celebrate the creation of jobs that seem below them, it's the gratitude of those who receive employment that matter.

Hetero people have the problem of being critiqued or ostracized if they present themselves in an unusual way, too.
Seriously. Pigs have very sharp teeth and painful bites. That pitty is taking it like a champ.
No. Here's my take (I'm indulging myself here a little; I work in the industry and this a chance for me to practice articulating my logic for talking with customers):\n\nThe designers have incorporated elements that give the bike a grab and go commuter feel. Out of the box, it will have that feel. But the price appears to be hedging on that feeling you'll get out of the box, without considering the *cost of ownership* vs the *purchase price*. Owning this bike locks you into a number of proprietary components that would be difficult to replace, or at best become obsolete requiring that you bypass them for components you could have purchased and implemented on a much more affordable bike to begin with.\n\nFirst, the drive train: it's a beltdrive (!). Everyone has been hearing that belt drives are great. And they are great, in ways, for a commuter. But you have to keep in mind that they're rare still, and that means expensive and inconvenient. They don't need the service that chains do and they have a long life if stored properly, but they are expensive. Gates Carbon Drive CDX belts retail at $90. And according to their website "In laboratory testing, the Carbon Drive System lasts more than twice the life of chain." I don't spend anywhere near $45 on chains for my commuter.\n\nSecond, the integrated rack. It's nice to have a rack. This one, however, appears to be fixed to the integrated fender. That may not be an issue, but it may since it introduces a structurally weak spot and an additional potential point of failure. It may hold up as well as a cheaper Blackburn or even Planet Bike rack, but if it doesn't, you have a proprietary system to work with for replacement. You have to buy from Canyon again, and they control the price. Even if their price was reasonable, it makes me uncomfortable knowing I don't have another option, or that I would have to spend a lot of time and energy researching to find an alternative. Related, the fenders are also proprietary so when one gets lodged to a poorly designed bike rack and bends, again, you're heading back to Canyon and giving them more money.\n\nThird, the dynamo hub/integrated light. See above: not necessarily bad stuff, but not exactly top of the line, either and you're stuck with their design. You could bypass the light and install your own, but you could also purchase an equivalent bike at a much lower price and install your preference of dynamo. \n\nFinally, I don't trust websites that don't offer closeup pictures of their bikes. Especially this one where the design is all proprietary and integrated and they don't even give you closeups of the unusual contact points. \n\nAll in all, if $1,491 (converted--I'm American) isn't a lot of money for you, this would be a fine bike. But I wouldn't purchase it unless I could comfortably afford to buy two of them without blinking. At that price you could work with a local bike shop and get 90% of what you desire in a semi-customized build while minimizing future maintenance and headache.\n\nThanks for letting me organize some thoughts. It's genuine advice, but you know you and your needs better than me. Best of luck and happy commuting!

>As far as I can tell there's almost no useful information that's carried in gendered pronouns\n\nGender. Gender is carried in the use of gender pronouns. It's a category we use to make sense of the world around us that is pretty much established to be innate to the human brain and the vast majority of languages make a distinction in referring to men or women.\n\nI know it's becoming more common for people to assert their own gender neutrality or, in some cases, even to refute [the idea that there is biological difference between genders.](http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/dec/2/university-historian-biological-sex-misconception/) This doesn't change the objective fact that there are scientifically established biological differences between males and females (and intersex individuals are an example of the exception that proves the rule, not an invalidation of the whole notion.) For proof, one need look no further than the dichotomous exclusivity of the uterus.\n\nWhile I would welcome the introduction of an *additional* gender neutral pronoun into regular use, I, as an individual, would almost certainly ignore any new rule that eliminated he/him/she/or her as they are incredibly useful when it comes to communication--it allows for more brevity, better clarification of reference, and in cases of complex stories or when referring to multiple people, it's indispensable. To wit:\n\nMy mother and little brother went to the store to pick up groceries. She wanted ice cream but she told her no. She started crying and threw a fit in the isle, right in front of a crowd of people. One man stepped in to console her and made her laugh. My mother laughed, too, and she thanked her. She picked my brother up off the floor and they carried on.\n\nv\n\nMy mother and little brother went to the store to pick up groceries. He wanted ice cream but she told him no.

They feel clunky and slow down the train of thought.\n\nEdit: reversed order of example stories for emphasis

For Zion, you have your choice of a few places. Springdale, right outside of the park, is probably most expensive since it's a "resort" town, but you'll be there in the off season so prices might be down a bit. Hurricane would be a cheaper option, about 20 minutes away. You could also stay in St. George or Cedar City, each about an hour away from the park entrance.\n\nThe park and hikes should be open, though there may or may not be shuttle service. I'd check their [website](https://www.nps.gov/zion/index.htm) and maybe even call before your trip to be sure. Angel's Landing is easily the best hike in the park, in my opinion.\n\nI've only been to Bryce once, and it was a short visit. It's just over 2 hours away from Zion, but that's about all the help I can be.\n\nHave a great trip!
Glad you found the advice useful. Honestly, I don't know the British market or the brands/models that may be available. And you're right, my advice is based on a thorough understanding of and access to custom builds.\n\nMy best advice would be to go to your local bike shop and show them this bike. Tell them that's your upper cap on price and you'd like to know if they could recommend an equivalent with emphasis on ease of maintenance and better cost-effective replacement/upgrade options. Then go to another bike shop with that new information and get a 2nd opinion. It's a little extra effort on your part, but long term satisfaction and savings will be worth the effort, and frankly, from my perspective, that's how the market ought to work.\n\nIf you get into the process and have questions about any specific components and their alternatives, feel free to pm me. I'd be happy to help.
I'd add that the endorphin high alters how I take in the scenery, too. I'm in a different mindset because of the pedaling. But the stopping is as enjoyable as the riding often.

Honestly, that's great for you and your brother. I'm not arguing against people pursuing those fields as you have. But you two got the equivalent of a "scholarship" in the field. Lots of people in universities are being paid to be there because they've demonstrated aptitude, too.\n\nIt's possible to do it the way you and your brother have, but you have to admit it's not an economic model that will scale up. There's a limited number of positions that people can enter straight into and get paid while they train. It's just one component of a larger economic model that requires engineers, designers, marketers, accountants, lawyers, etc, most of whom need advanced degree-level training to help the company grow.\n\nI grew up on a farm. I did dirty jobs, and I enjoyed it. I still enjoy it. But I also went to a university and got an education that has freed me from being stuck lifelong in a field that is being squeezed out of existence by massive corporate farms. My family doesn't own the farm anymore because it got to the point where we weren't breaking even anymore, despite the fact that my father worked 12 hour days minimum and me and my four brothers were working after school every single day to keep it afloat. The massive farms figured out a better economic model and we were the casualties. Fortunately for me and my brothers, higher education has opened up opportunities for us that weren't available before and we're all better off because of it.
Why don't we see more of the world turning to India for a model on managing a large democratic voting process?
Y'all realize that spacesuits are actually air conditioned, right? While the ambient temperature in space is extremely low, the fact that you're in a vacuum means that your body heat is not transferred through conduction. Even without a space suit on you wouldn't freeze--or at least you'd be dead from other things long before the *absence of heat* did you in.
A Santa Fe would probably be fine as long as it's not raining (or freshly rained.)\n\nBe aware of one truism about southern Utah (I'm assuming you're not from here...): The certain way to ruin a trip is to try to see everything. It's huuuuuge. 12 is pretty, but it's just a paved mountain road. Burr Trail would be a lot more adventurous ride and I'd recommend it. Don't try to do all three, though. Choose one and enjoy the view. Then come back and do the others next year :)\n\nBut seriously, before setting out on any of the backroads, check with the locals at Hell's Backbone Grill or Burr Trail Grill. They know the conditions day to day.
Trump as volunteer was my first thought, too
It's a [brand](http://www.smartwool.com/). It's basically wool that doesn't itch. You wouldn't know it's wool unless someone told you.
I think the question is more about how the large scale system of roads would be managed by private companies. Take interstate freeways, for example--who awards contracts? Who designs the system? Who's responsible for maintenance? Who is liable for covering natural disaster damage? What system would be in place to assure that the interests of the residents of all states would be taken into consideration? Are they toll operated?\n\nMany questions that I've never heard satisfying answers to
> There are some situations where it makes things clearer, there's other where it makes them less clear\n\nThe only situation I can think of where having gendered pronouns would make things less clear is in a case where someone prefers not to have their gender identified. This represents a tiny fraction of 1% of the English speaking world.\n\n>right now it seems like right now the most popular choice when a gender neutral term is needed is to use "he"\n\nI don't think this is the case at all. If anything, "they" is the prevailing choice, but is an option riddled with its own complications (there are important reasons to maintain a difference between plural or singular pronouns.)\n\n>Why not pick the word that shows we're making a conscious choice and not just doing something because "it's always been done that way" (which is very nearly the worst argument imaginable)\n\nBecause when it comes to language, reducing the number of conscious choices one has to make is the ultimate goal. Language, to be effective, needs to be logical, clear, and mostly subconscious in use. It's completely reasonable for a person to use certain words because that's the way it's most commonly done in the language; in fact, that is the very basis on which we define words. The Oxford English Dictionary is a prime example of this in that it doesn't necessarily define words per se, but rather gives examples of common usage which then give the word meaning.
Are you actually one of us, Clint? Or are you just using our double entendre because it's cool?
Well, there's a lot to consider. I can't really think of any bikes that I'd recommend across the board. You have to take into account things like your personal commute, distance, time of day you'll be riding, road conditions, your personal fitness, your goals as a rider, etc., etc.\n\nFor example, I commute on a [29+ mountain bike](http://www.bikepacking.com/tag/29-plus/) in a large city. It's not at all the most efficient machine, but it offers a lot more in other areas of personal preference for me that make up for the little bit extra energy I have to put in.\n\nThat said, for $500, the [Sirrus](https://www.specialized.com/us/en/bikes/utility/sirrus/106252) is a fine bike. Being a Specialized, it's pretty much aligned with all of the standard spacing, sizing, and fitting of componentry which makes it upgradeable and easy to find replacement parts. A quick google search brought up [this article](http://www.bicycling.com/bikes-gear/reviews/16-for-2016-the-years-best-city-bikes), which gives a nice array. Everything listed is reasonable and if you take into account my assessment of integrated/proprietary gear in my initial comment, you should be able to make the decision that works best for you. 
They're not protecting the President round the clock. They're protecting the "first" lady. It's unprecedented in the modern era and they'll probably make NYC pay for some of it. Besides, I don't want to pay with my federal taxes for his selfish decision to live in two places, when we're already providing him with a waaaaay more than perfectly good residence in D.C.\n\nThis action. From a guy who says taxes are too high and the government is corrupt. What a shill. What a twofaced fuck wad.
I'd say at the very least use a torque wrench
This sucks for labor rights, but I think "bold predictions" is a bit of an overstatement, as well as being in this sub. The predictions were that Trump wants things, but his hands are going to be tied by the momentum of things Obama got going, so there will be slight scale-backs, but nothing catastrophic.\n\nI'm not saying I agree, I'm just pointing out for those who didn't read the article, that that's what it says.
Right, but what if one of the girls whips her ponytail in the wrong direction last minute? Science learning like this is fucking rad, but PPE is rad, too.
I'm a city boy now and have gotten pretty good at hiding it. But it usually comes back out when I talk about the farm :)
> Can't help but feel you may have wandered off base if your movement cares about the moral judgment of lawyers.\n\nI'd say that qualifies as a blanket statement about lawyers and their ability to discern morality
Totally agree, both are important

Nothing. Until the circuit is broken, the machine will continue to operate. After it's broken, it will stop. The handle of the snips is insulated, so no circuit will be created through the handle. So, fast or slow, it will operate the same.
This is the best answer in keeping with the spirit of the question, imo. It's a fine bike, but goddammit people, stop praising the damn thing like the 2nd coming of the Messiah. It's a cheap, Chinese made bike with room for fat tires. That's all.
Agree he's a piece of shit. But he's got the job. Part of the job is listening to people like me call him up and tell him to do his job better. The more he hears from us the more it interrupts his schemes.
This happened to a cow on my dad's farm. The horn loop-di-looed into the cow's temple and kept on growing. Rather than lose the cow, my dad decided to try and cut it out and see what happened.\n\nWe rounded the cows up one Saturday, corralled them, and isolated the poor sonofabitch, herding her into the squeeze chute. Once immobilized my dad took a hack saw to the horn and cut it clean through. Then he wiggled the ingrown end a bit until it broke loose from the skin, and pulled it out.\n\nYou could see the cow's brain. There was about a 2 inch diameter tunnel leading into the poor cow's head with everything laid bare in front of God and all of us. Dad gave it a couple generous sprays of iodine to hopefully stave off infection and released the chute and out stumbled ol' hole-in-the-head. She wobbled like a newborn for a while, stumbling, falling over, clearly disoriented, muscles not behaving. Lasted about 5 minutes then she went back to the herd. Eventually the hole in her head healed and she was fine. 
I think the suggestion is that he is actually not an idiot. He plays one on twitter because it's a useful distraction from his actions behind the curtain
Just a note for longevity of your shifter, wd-40 will unfreeze things, but it will also eliminate all lubrication that is supposed to be there. If you do use wd-40, I would follow up with a longish blast of canned air and a quick shot of spray lubricant (something light)
Let's muddy the waters. I just called Congressman Chaffetz's office in D.C. again to urge him to investigate Trump's conflicts of interest. It's the first time I've gotten through to a human in 3 tries. Hopefully that means they're getting a lot of calls. Let's keep it up!\n\nhttp://chaffetz.house.gov/contact/officeinformation.htm\n\n(202)225-7751 D.C.\n(801)851-2500 Provo, UT
When you say rental car, what make and model are you talking about? Burr Trail is rough. I'd only try it with a high clearance vehicle (like a Subaru wagon). Hell's backbone might be decent, but it's always hard to say what winter does to dirt roads. You'll want to ask the locals about road conditions before you go. \n\nAlso, it's another 1.5 hours over boulder mountain to get to Torrey, then on to Capitol Reef. You'll be pushing it. But I'm pretty sure there are primitive camping spots along the Staircase if you want to stay near boulder for a night
Well, I wouldn't argue that there are a lot of people in our country that would balk at the idea of spending on that or any sort of massive federal operation. Government throwing lots of money and employees at anything is seen as wasteful.\n\nAnother thing to consider about the US is that the country itself, geography-wise, is huge. Our population is large, but it's over a big enough land mass that in many places, it feels sparse. It's hard to get everyone to agree on anything at the federal level because we just don't know much about each other's lives the way people in much more dense regions like the EU or India do.\n\nBut I don't want to give the impression I'm defending the way we do voter registration. We need electoral system overhaul in a big way. I'm just trying to get at the explanations for why were are where we are right now

What size are you currently riding and why do you want to go down?\n\nEither way, the answer is: if it feels good, it's right. But you'll only know that after riding it for a month or more.

Patience, son. He's been president for exactly 2 days. I give him at least until the end of next week before pulls the rug out completely from under his supporters.
Buy [this](https://www.amazon.com/NoTubes-TU80051-Parent-Tire-Sealant/dp/B00GZHZQNS), put two ounces in each tube by removing the valve core with a needle nose plier and injecting with a syringe or similar bottle with a tiny funnel. Replace the valve core, reinstall tube and inflate, then do the "stans dance", spinning the wheel and bouncing it on the ground for 2-3 minutes. Put on bike and go.\n\nIt lasts 6 months, but you can just put another 2oz in (once) without removing the tire. After a year, replace the tube and repeat. You do have to replace a tube once a year, but you get to choose when you do it (like a lazy Sunday afternoon, rather than on the way to work.)\n\nEnjoy!
If everyone who needed convincing just took the 30 seconds it took me to phone Chaffetz's office that could be millions of calls/emails/postcards he'd be receiving. Gets to a point where it's hard to ignore. And if millions actually did it, there are bound to be some in the group who start compiling analytics of the volume of calls he's receiving and making it public.\n\nIt may not change the world. But it might. And I guess I just think it's worth 1 minute out of my day.
Thanks for the info. I'm curious, how many miles would you say you've put on it since purchase? And where do you ride? Weather, road conditions, etc. I ask because it all comes in to factor as I mentioned in a comment above.\n\nFor the record, I'm CEO of a retail outlet with four locations, not just a mechanic ;) But your point stands--I do generate income off repairs. My advice, however, was generally designed to help OP save money in the long run. My chains last at least a full year, which is thousands of miles, but they do require a little preventative maintenance. I clean and re-lube them about 4 times a year.\n\nIn general, if you live in an area with lots of precipitation, and you're not keen to keep up on maintenance then internally geared mechanisms are the way to go. But failure is one of many factors to consider. When they fail, they're expensive to replace.\n\nCheers man. Happy riding :)
> He should never, ever even have been given a platform.\n\nHow was everyone to know this before he spewed his vitriol? If we refuse to engage with anyone we dislike before even giving them the chance to speak, then all we're doing is conscientiously constructing an echo chamber. That path will destroy the left. It's suicide.\n\nYes, Milo's an abomination and, in my opinion, a vile human being. I've thought it for years. But let's not throw the baby out with the bathwater. Let people speak and make them eat their foolish words in public. If we can't beat them in a debate, then maybe our arguments need to be honed better. But it's only *through* engaging them in debate that we'll learn to do that.
In my experience, taking on the extra work and documenting it is what has gotten me promotions in the past. In interviews, I get to say, "Yeah, I know how to do this. I've already been doing it."

Anyway, wasn't the loss of legislative seats because of the gerrymandering operation RedMap or whatever? They lost hard in the 2008 presidential so they hatched a plan to redraw district lines home by home in some areas. In 2010 there were states (Pennsylvania if I remember) that went 60%+ of the vote for democrats, but the redistricting was clever enough that it translated to like 30/70 dem/republican seats?\n\nhttp://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/03/opinion/sunday/the-great-gerrymander-of-2012.html?pagewanted=all&_r=0

I like Mike Rowe. But this quote is absurd, and hypocritical of him if it's true. He's the biggest supporter of trade tech jobs, many of which require years of training at no tiny expense. An electrician, for example, is at least 2 years of schooling and another 2-3 apprenticing. And the two years cost around 30-40K where I live. Sure it's a bit cheaper than a university degree, but the earning potential of the degree is 10x that of the trade tech certificate.\n\nYes we should encourage kids to do "dirty jobs" and we should pay better for the ones that can't be automated (yet). But we also need to consider that progress as a species means finding more efficient ways to do work which produces more complex problems that need creative human work to solve. Not doing this is to artificially keep ourselves stuck in the "good ol' days" and prevents our civilization from improving itself.
Be careful in your cars, too.
If you can afford it, [this](https://www.amazon.com/Black-Diamond-BD810151WASAALL1-Firstlight-Tent/dp/B0036XAPOE/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1482377757&sr=8-2&keywords=black+diamond+first+light) is the best tent I've found. It's lightweight, sure, but I bought it more for the reason that it's compact. It packs up the size of a football, with the poles in a separate bag. It also assembles from the inside without having to run the poles through sleeves.\n\nIt goes from the bag to ready for action in 4 minutes and breaks down in 7. It's marketed as a two person, which is true, if uncomfortable. My brother and I did a month tour in Argentina and shared it nearly every night, and we still talk. It's plenty spacious for one person and gear. And it's 95% waterproof, which is good enough for me; I've been in torrential downpours in it and only suffered a few drips here and there.\n\nI shopped around online and found mine for ~$220\n

You don't live in the Western US, do you? The electricians, plumbers, coal miners, etc around here actively fight against unions.\n\nEdit: I just remembered which subreddit I'm in and it's strange to have someone arguing *for* unions here. Isn't Reagan a local hero in r/conservative? No one fought against unions harder than him. (For the record, I consider myself a left-leaning centrist, but I sympathize with a lot of conservative ideals, especially the fiscal ones.)

It's really only a 4 hour drive from the best ski resorts to Zion NP, or Moab. If I were planning a week or two I would hit the better snow in the Wasatch Front, then drive down to the parks and actually get the best of both worlds. Keep in mind that it's going to be cold in the desert in mid Jan.  Highs generally in the low 40s, lows in the singles or teens. Have a great trip!
> Engaging =/= giving a platform\n\nYes it does. This is exactly, semantically, what "engaging" is.\n\nTo be more specific, Breitbart news gave Milo a platform. They propped him up as a legitimate voice for a movement. In doing so, they created their hero, who they then send to engage with whomever is willing. That's how it works. I think the pretentious little rich prick is appalling, but I'll grant him that he was right about one thing in the Bill Maher interview, "if you don't show up for the debate, you lose."\n\nIt all distills down to the pragmatics of debate in free society. Does engaging with him (giving him a platform from which to speak) cause some damage? Sure. Does silencing him (refusing to allow him to publish on twitter for example) stop the damage? I think his following grew after the outrage over his twitter ban. If simply silencing those we don't like worked, I'd be all for it. But 2 things: 1) it doesn't. and 2) who gets to choose whom we silence?
Guarantee his agent told him to do this regardless of what's going on trade-wise. Dude's got nothing to gain by talking to the media right now.

Horford = 4 star recruit. Brewer = 4 star recruit. Noah = 4 star recruit. Taurean Green (the PG of that team) = 3 star recruit. Lee Humphrey (the SG of that team) = 3 star recruit. The fact that those guys developed into the players they did speaks more favorably about Billy's coaching than his recruiting.\n\n
Where the professional lip readers at?
Care to explain why you think I'm wrong? "You're a fucking idiot" has never resulted in any good discourse. In fact, your comment history seems to indicate that insulting people is pretty much all you're good at. Perhaps because it's the only thing you know how to do.

Keep making these lists, keep adding to them, make them comprehensive, post them everywhere.

Sure.\n\nExamples of silencing opposition would be firing people in the Administration when they voice opinions contrary to the views and policy of the Trump/Bannon cadre (see Sally Yates, see shutdown of Executive Branch twitter feeds, see the NSC staffer that was recently fired.)\n\nExamples of media censorship. Well, see today. A shining example.\n\nVoters have not yet been suppressed explicitly by the Administration but the GOP has been doing this overtly and openly for years, and there is certainly rhetoric from the Administration that leads one to believe that voter suppression will be engaged in at some point, especially with the investigations into what's being deemed "voter fraud" during the election. Trump has incessantly voiced his insecurity about the number of votes he lost the popular vote by, and you can be sure that the actions that result from any such investigations will be of the voter suppression ilk.\n\nConsolidation of power. All of the above lead to this sort of thing. Cooking the books to show that economic growth is better than it is, for example. Sending out biased surveys that can only have one possible answer. They are just ways to further entrenching themselves as the ruling party, validating themselves as the kings of the land, and not allowing other opinions to be heard. The country was built on the power of having the freedom to voice myriad opinions. Anything in opposition to that is a violation of democratic principles.\n\nA recent example of lack of consistent ideology: pro-states rights when it comes to transgender people, but against states rights when it comes to marijuana. \n\nAn example of lack of shame...there are a thousand of these. Grabbing pussies, thinking he's too smart to need intelligence briefings, not reading presidential memorandums, never taking the blame for anything or ever apologizing, or at least acknowledging that a mistake may have been made. My favorite is probably when he yelled at a baby during his campaign.\n\nAnd like I said. It's not a dictatorship yet. And I hope it never becomes one. But it is trending in that direction moreso than has any presidency in recent history, and we must speak up lest it become that way.
Good idea. I'll switch the link to Soundcloud. I wasn't all that impressed, and she's always impressed. By literally every movie. So that's what you can expect from this one.
Just want to point out in your Ravens analysis, that Miami's O-line has been playing damn well and is likely the key catalyst for the 6-game winstreak. That being said, we do have some potential injuries on the line that are worth keeping an eye on (Tunsil, Albert, Pouncey).
Dead serious. If anything, they're pretty equivalent. He really should be referred to as Eddie Jones, Lakers and Heat SG.

I've always felt objectivity is a somewhat mythical concept; that in order to reach objectivity, we must first accept that it's not possible for anyone to be objective. So, where I think objectivity happens--or at least comes close to happening--is at the confluence of numerous perspectives. In other words, some convergence of numerous subjective realities.\n\nTake the whole "best versus favorite" debate. Are these two questions different, or are they the same?:\n\n* What do you think the top 5 best movies ever are? \n* What are your top 5 favorite movies ever?\n\nI think they're different. I think correctly answering the first question requires that a vast number of humans answer the second question. And that's why we have movies that are acclaimed as the "best ever." So, in that sense, yes, if movie A is thought subjectively better than movie B by some undefined critical mass of humans, then that movie is objectively better.\n\nBUT, maybe not, because what about the hivemind biases of human beings? What if we are only evaluating our subjective "bests" based on what we've been taught by others is supposed to be good? What if we only think a movie is good if our friends or favorite critic think it's good? So, is the most objective answer we as humans can collectively come to still, in fact, an entirely subjective one?\n\nI guess, then, it depends on this: is "objectivity" some sort of natural law or order a la gravity; OR does "objectivity" only exist in the minds of human beings? If it's the former, I think the answer to OP's question is no. If it's the latter, I think the answer to OP's question is yes.\n\nBut truthfully, I have no fucking clue.
But can you imagine his rallies?\n\n"CAN YOU SMELL....WHAT THE ROCK IS COOKING?"\n\nPeople would go nuts.
I thought what he had to say was extremely interesting: the trend of the NBA is away from hero ball, and that, while statistically superior and "safer", may very well deprive of us moments similar to those iconic moments that are in fact among the greatest moments in the history of basketball. I don't see anyone else making that point.
And if there's not...is it possible to port one over?
What the Heat are doing right now should be attractive in free agency.

I initiate the direct deposit into their account. I have their bank information, they don't have mine.
I ask you in return: What was the point of the GOP obstructionism for the last 6 years before Trump became president? \n\nThat was a very overt policy in place by Mitch McConnell. He's extremely proud of it. Merrick Garland was the epitome, but there was so much more.

Lol, how's this? It's a video: https://video.foxnews.com/v/5320735275001/?#sp=show-clips
Actually, too late
This happened to me recently, too. Almost exactly one year after I purchased it. Barely snuck it in for a free repair under the warranty. Seems like you might be expired, but it's worth checking.
Exactly, so why the hell would he ever pass?
It's almost as if this sorta thing has become so routine that we never see CP3 touted for his highlights anymore.

LeBatard, yes. Stugotz, not so much. 
Yes, thank you for doing this. This needed to be done. I would like to see a version that also includes everything he did or said in his campaign, because a lot of that stuff (no tax returns, pussy-grab video) is intertwined with what he's doing today. Hold him accountable for EVERYTHING. Let the record stand for EVERYTHING. Not just the latest thing. And also you could create categorical groups, like "Ties with Russia" or "Personal E-mail Use." And furthermore, I'd like to see a dated list of one-line headlines with hyperlinks to the deeper explanations. And I also echo the users who think we should include everything, even the good stuff. TPP is an example. Choosing not to touch certain LGBT stuff with an EO is another example (even if "not doing something" is a low standard for action, it's still positive).\n\nIt's a lot of work, to be sure. Also wanted to thank you for doing what you've done so far.
Haven't been able to log back in since it happened, but will try to check tonight.
Thanks, just discovered this sub! Looking forward to participating.

A fair trade, I'd say.
Damn, this is a really good one. I've been following the NBA for 15+ years now and I've probably heard his name once or twice. Just looked up his numbers and they were nice: http://www.basketball-reference.com/players/t/thompda01.html

Heat. Mike Miller. Changed the course of the Big Three era, IMO.
Surprised that Mizar from Jet Force Gemini hasn't gained traction. That mothefucker. I still haven't beaten him to this day. And I'm too scarred to go back. 
It's not a "real record", but it is certainly illustrative. I've never understood the problem people have with these sorts of statistics. So what? They tell a story.
This would be fun.
Me too, would have gained my respect back
What? Where did you hear this? You think liberals desire that people be jobless? You can't possibly believe that. \n\nTechnological advance is not partisan. It is its own, apolitical force utilized by folks of all stripes.  
Completely agree, but could you see how the left would be perceived as spineless if it didn't employ the same tactics?
Bummer, thanks for the quick reply. 
Legendary performance.
It's from a Fox News video, the article doesn't matter: https://video.foxnews.com/v/5320735275001/?#sp=show-clips
Am I crazy for starting Derek Carr over him?
If he indeed becomes the Republican candidate, this stance could lose him the Presidential election. Too many people are on minimum wage...which, of course, is why we can't eliminate it, and calling for it's elimination spells political death.
That's the most ridiculous thing I've ever heard. A lot of people but a boatload of a lot of time into making this game, and it's sure as hell worth $5. I consider $30 a goddamn steal. While there are some remaining, the devs have done a great job addressing a host of issues that were present at the start. It's not perfect--no game is--but it's incredibly fun game, well-polished, and crisp. I and countless others have put over 400 hours into it, and there's a reason we aren't stopping.
I'm as anti-Trump as it gets, but I don't believe that PolitiFact should be dabbling in this sort of content. Meaning, stick to the Truth-O-Meter, or risk delving too far into the land of opinion, which totally degrades your core foundation and puts you at risk of being called fake news. 
I don't want your stupid game! Wait, forgive me, I lied. I do want it. 
I would say this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Op-CdfiOI\n\nIf I wasn't there in person for this: https://youtu.be/X_lN7n_foUI?t=6m23s
Yep, appreciate it, did another edit.
The Hill is left? I always thought it was pretty damn center.
This is the blueprint for a democracy slowly turning into a dictatorship. One step at a time. Some of the steps are small. Some of the steps are large. But they are all trending in the same direction. Consolidation of power. Silencing of opposition. Suppressing voters. Censorship of media. No ideologies, no principles, no shame.
The one where both he and Kanter go up for the oop is most illustrative of Russell Westbrook in my eyes. They both had a shot at it the ball, hell, the ball may have even been *meant* for Kanter, but Russell is that much more tenacious, athletic, quick, and merciless. He doesn't care who it is next to him. He and he alone is slamming that basketball through the fucking hoop.
melanin is racist
I think you should include conflicting reports in general. Make this as unbiased as possible. Give people as little opportunity as possible to spin it.
Please explain this grain of truth 
Well no ones commented on this one yet. So I will.\n\n\nCool.
Hey man, they already notified the finalists a couple weeks back. Interviews are March 14/15. \n
You asked how it could affect. I told you how. I'm not saying he will.
Does the amount of time spent in the army have a large effect? 
I'll see if I can find the article. It may have been a Spivey piece. If I find it, I'll post it here. 
this\n
It may be better for some, but it's not a great enough school for you to leave San Antonio and take on debt. And the reason to go to a better school is to get a better job. You already have that. \n\nIf you can do it for free, go with St Mary's. It's a pretty well respected school in San Antonio and the surrounding area. It seems like you won't be leaving the area. \n
WOW, so this post was **FAKE NEWS** the whole time. 
Why anyone would brag about cum laude at a state school is beyond me. 
If you have a BA, you don't need a J.D. for activism/social justice. \n\nI would say HYS are the best to win local office. Possibly H for lay prestige and networking. 
Actually, I can prove that Hillary stood no chance. Give me a map and I'll show you each state she lost. I don't even need "an iota of critical thinking" for that feat. 
Yup. Totally worth it. Work on the lsat. Going to SMU and then moving back just doesn't make sense for a young family. 
> Haha I don't really know what you are trying to say \n\nThat's okay. 
This is good. These interviews usually happen earlier in life. Just use the experience to get confident for other interviews. I'm always looking back to my botched red cross interview before I walk into an interview. I know it can't ever be that bad again. 
LOL, and yet you continue to insult them. Even when you're "in the midst of facing dictatorship." 
Unless the other career involves maths. Then it is *harder.*
Okay, now do why not to go to Yale. Just got into Stanford and ignored Yale's invitations to apply. \n\nI assumed I wouldn't fit the school's culture but those clerk numbers.  
Just send it in writing that you would like to withdraw your application to the law school. I did the same thing with Chicago. I did it the day before my interview too. I just said in the interest of the admission's blah blah time, I'd like to inform you I can not attend X. So I would like to formally withdraw my application.\n\nedit: email = writing, also call if you don't get a response within 30 mins.\n\nDon't say you're withdrawing because of other schools. They'll let you withdraw now because it won't hurt their YP. 
If you're not yet admitted then yes by however much your gpa changed.
If by decent you mean HYS, no. T50? Yes.\n\nlstreports.com
Or just upgrade the memory. You should really only need to buy a new pc every 4-5 years. Unless you're a gamer but that's another subreddit. \n\n2012 MacBook pro here. Works great.    
Yea, I thought it was a big deal until I went on brietbart. Then they explained to me that I was actually fatigued and don't mind anymore. So Trump 2020, because I hate liberals and their hate agenda 
Nah man. Fuck Spivey. This guy was on the admissions board while he was a law student. Spivey ain't got shit on him.  /s
Cum Laude at most state schools is just meeting a GPA floor. It's lowest honors. I can see someone bragging about Cum Laude in law school. In state school, not so much. 
Brah, what school is this? I imagine it will be okay to bring my ma to T5 schools?
But he waived an LGBT flag? What's going on here? More 4-d chess?  
I think rigging primaries can have a huge impact.
I'm sure it's a very wide net. 
> However, you can't get the assessment for practice area and setting fit elsewhere for free. It's powered by The Right Profile and they sell a comparable report for $79 (it's a hybrid of that report and their more expensive $129 report). Moreover, the LST Wizard ranks schools based on your personal input. Naturally, it relies on other data we make publicly available, but the ordering and separation can't be replicated well otherwise.\n> \n\nI guess we just can't see the value in it. Have you considered offering a limited trial? Maybe like what USNews does. 
We will be waiting 
They can show prejudice, antagonism and discrimination. They just can't be racist in the USA. \n\nFor example, an Islamic man from Saudi Arabia can't exert racism in the USA. However, in Saudi Arabia, where he is part of the class in power, he can. \n\nHe is a dick in both examples. It's just that for those who understand the high lwvel definition of "racism" it's a bit silly when it's used imprecisely. \n\nI agree that anyone can be racist using the definition I learned in elementary school. \n\n
Just get some disposable phones and give them to your friends.\n\nI recommend writing your LOR with your left hand so it seems someone else wrote them. 
I doubt they will ding him for an email. What's more likely to happen is they will ask him about his resume during the interview. If he's smooth enough he'll get in. Though they may check with his recommenders. \n\nUp to you. He could just be another DBAG biglaw associate (likely) or the next POTUS (not likely).\n\n
Is your family wealthy or did you just not apply for financial aid? 
Listen kid. \n\nHire a consultant to help you write a bomb personal statement. Get a 169+. If possible get some work experience. It's a huge plus. Then go to HYS. It's possible. 
> who's **going** to go to law school ( a field with massive underemployment).\n\nWe should all celebrate.
No, not true. Small envelope contained acceptance. 
Go ahead and retake. I scored lower on my retake. I got in to S with my first score. 
About 7% less favorable. 
The guy fucked up. He provided information that was out of scope to the question. As a lawyer, that was pretty dumb. I mean Bill Clinton did a pretty good job, being a lawyer. That guy said shit during his hearing. \n\nTrump needs to ask for his resignation and get a new AG that can enforce policy with less baggage. It's still early in the game. The fall out will pass. 
Wow dude, yes that's extreme. I'm in at SLS awaiting HLS, with weak stats. During my interview, I was told my softs made the difference. \n\nThis guy is a dick. I'm sure it happens all the time. Maybe that's reason enough to ignore it. Just letting people talk their way to the top. MAGA
Emory! Have you been to UGA? No thanks. 
They do give a shit at HYS. \n\nA 3.7 no activity is not looked at better than a 3.6 with published paper/ leadership roles.\n\nedit: maybe a stretch here, but the same general point
Are you equating a closed primary to a national election? Anyways, I've no idea why you're upset. Seems like your preferred candidate got her chance. 
His response was the exact reason you didn't say anything during class. The irony. \n\nNow you're a whiny liberal and unless you suck it up, white moderates won't take you seriously. 
Any chance at UT Austin? 
You wouldn't\n\n #courage\n\n/s
Nope, guy needs to get a job at a NY law firm with a reputation for only hiring Harvard graduates. 
What would be an easy way? Serious question. 
>     Neanderthals were also considered to be more intelligent than modern homo sapiens. I am VERY intelligent. I easily get straight As in school without even trying. Neanderthals also had incestuous tendencies like I do.\n\n/r/iamverysmart 
Nah he nixed himself. Even for a gunner he fails. He should have never told anyone he lied.
My whole life is fake news!!!! 
Nope, blessed with some very generous merit scholarship. I appreciate the concern, though. And my school has one of the highest employment rates. God willing, I think I'll be okay. \n\nPM me if you need tips on getting into law school. If that's your thing.\n
Yup, no worries. And my interview was given on someone else's recommendation. Meaning that not only did I look bad, I also made that person look bad. But a month later, eh.\n\nIt's like getting rejected after asking out a girl you really like. The first time is the worst, and then it's just not as bad again. 
They're going to eat this poor boy alive. 
Don't go to UGA. Get your numbers up to a full ride at T14. 
Is that good or are you being sarcastic? 
Make a throwaway email. \nEmail admissions office. \nInclude identifying information of friend (name). Just say his resume may have some discrepancies. \nThen they will ask him about it in the interview. \n \n\np.s. Same shit happened with an acquaintance of mine. Guy did nothing but chill but had a decent GPA and DAT score due to all the free time. He lied (asked us to look over his resume). A friend who was super involved had a lower GPA. She was rejected. According to the resumes, he was just as involved but with a better GPA. \n\n
Texan here, please don't come. Both schools are horrible and I heard they are closed. If you already live in Texas, please leave. As a douche bag, you may enjoy living in your natural habitat up in the north east. \n\nAlso, in case you missed it, you're a douche. 
That's not what he meant.\n
No, the more time out of school the better. 
I'd consider it if the price was $20. \n
And you keeping doing it. It's not about getting our way, it's about you wrongly thinking you're right. I still voted for HRC. She lost. 
True. \n\nTrump will likely dig deeper in, instead of firing him. \n\nShould have been Cruz (as AG)
Just book the flights seperatly. Each school will ask you for a reciept. 
If you have a 179, I doubt it would hurt. But unique w/e is always a plus. 
Hey, I took the September LSAT and retook in December. I applied late November. I received my JS1 two weeks after the December scores were released. They held my app until the December scores. \n\nMaybe come up with a worthy reason to send them a LOCI. Maybe you got a promotion or a higher GPA?
I think Berkeley really weighs LOR heavily. Also got in thanks to a good LOR imo. \n
I just barely got my check for the January 21st protests. I'm thinking about complaining to HR.
Why not just send a quick email? Or an LOCI.
No, many[ Hispanics are Catholic \\(pro-life\\)](http://cara.georgetown.edu/staff/webpages/Hispanic%20Catholic%20Fact%20Sheet.pdf). They could very well be one issue voters. 
Over performing, in at h/s below 25ths\n\nPublished / non-traditional \n\nProbably that's why 
Ah okay. Is it the norm that you do t get paid? 
He is lying about starting a non-profit. I think HYS cares.
Yes, which is why he was endorsed by the progressive 2016 candidate and not HRC shills.\n\nedit: nvm, that was Ellison
Nope, they actually recieved the scores before I did. And my status changed to complete. 
Nice, am doing this\n\nDo I need to enable something in settings or is it a default feature?
Use a different browser and try again. Or email the admissions office
Jesus Christ. I apologize if I went too far in something. I admit my brigade is petty, but it kept me from stressing about incoming decisions and such. \n\nI will totally work on being cool with classmates.\n\nAs for the callbacks, I'll be fine. I read up on all Spivey and friends had to say. I put their advice to work, and I'm in at a great school.  \n\n
Yea, I just got an email from a 2L. \n\nDamn, they are so close to getting my crisp 100 dolla. \n\nBut I don't think Yale is my cup of tea. 
Anecdotally, I can say they do. Half of my JS1 interview was talking about the specifics of my resume. \n\nedit:\nAlso yea, people say they were an officer of a club they were just members of. No big deal. This guy said he started a non-profit. 
I feel as if you're not speaking to the schools in question here (HYS).\n\n
I'm pro gay marriage, but I'm also pro delicious chicken sandwiches. Can't be surprised a Christian company that closes its doors on Sundays doesn't support gay marriage, but they will still serve them 
Where is Trump burning down the country??
I'm in the same position. The Harvard brand and network is a strong pull. And yet, I got into H/S from a shit state school. I was able to get in because I had awesome professors and relationships. I'm not a gunner, so I may not be able to outcompete the others for the prof's attention (and I honestly have no interest in doing so). \n\nAnyways, I'm leaning towards Stanford (75 to 25). I may want a clerkship and a strong recommendation letter will likely outweigh the H brand. \n\nIf you're gunning to SCOTUS go to H, if not come to SLS. (Because I want chill classmates ;) )\n\nStanford is growing in lay prestige too, if that matters to you.
> My point is that all softs for law school applicants are generally equal\n\nNo, maybe for already admitted students. I can see how the students already in a particular school would have similar softs.\n\n> it is the importance of those softs within the context of who you are that means more than what the specific soft is.\n\nSo softs speak to who you are? I agree.\n I may be misunderstanding what you're trying to say here.
Snap! If he truly lived by his beliefs, he should have refused the appointment. 
It's not a very academic atmosphere. IDK, maybe I'm too old. 
For hys, get a job that relates to your interests. \n\nConsultants range, but maybe 400-500 for a great one. You get a piece of mind. It's worth it. 
Not a negative I guess. Just hopefully it's full time. Include your hours worked in your resume.
Just know that schools (HYSC) do tend to limit the people they take from non-ivy schools to one. \n\nedit: \nsource http://www.lawschooladmissionsconsulting.com/does-the-prestige-of-your-college-affect-your-chances-of-admission-to-law-school-part-i/
> Thank you for shedding light on this, from now on I will only give advice that is narrowly tailored to my specific school.\n\nPlease\n\n> f we are getting technical, it would also be wise to discount any advice from an adcom at Yale in terms of an application to Harvard because the admissions process at these two schools are in no way the same.\n\nIt's a good thing the consulting companies have people from all three then. 
Law school can be rigorous AF. Having those extra commitments and a stellar GPA signals that you are probably capable of handling.\nLS+journal+life+stuff\n\nWhy are you so committed to defending unethical behavior?
I actually know zero. My info comes from HYS admissions officers who turned around and started consulting companies. I may be misinterpreting the information, but the information is credible. \n\nI don't doubt that you have a better grasp of your alma mater's process. However, unless it's HYS, it's not relevant to this particular scenario. 
Further edit: You're right. I was mistaken about the 3.6 vs 3.7 comparison. However, HYS have no shortage of qualified applicants and do look at softs to distinguish between applicants.
Enjoyed reading your post. 
Got into Berkeley & was snubbed with no $$, yet. Felt terrible, almost went with Michigan's tiny $ while on the rebound. I even convinced myself I liked the freezing cold. \n\nThen, weeks later, Stanford came knocking at my door. I want to take her out somewhere public where Berkeley can see us together.      
I lub you baby
No, I didn't say that. I'm saying he didn't handle himself well during the hearing. I don't think meeting with a Russian official is worthy of him being removed. I mean they didn't fire the AG when she met with Clinton. I'm just of the opinion that Sessions painted an easy target on himself. Trump seemed to be turning a new leaf on Tuesday, and this guy killed the momentum. 
http://www.lawschooladmissionsconsulting.com/does-the-prestige-of-your-college-affect-your-chances-of-admission-to-law-school-part-i/\n\nThis article speaks a little about it, although it isn't the one I have in mind. \n\n> So, what do you do if your school is in the second third or that quarter? Get your application in early.  What this analysis means, as a very practical matter, is that applicants from schools in these groups are, I believe, actually competing against their classmates for the spots, in a kind of informal quota, that a particular law school sets aside for your particular college.  It might have 10 spots for Penn (sorry to pick on you Penn!) with an expectation of yielding 5 or 6.  If you’re the 11th qualified applicant from Penn to get your application into the “to be adjudicated now” pile, you better have something better than your 10 lucky classmates had.  Of course they’ll still waive you in if you have a 178, but perhaps not if you have only what the median was for those 10.  So be one of those 10!
Yea seems like this guy will be fine. If I were you, I would do it. Actually, I wouldn't because, regretfully, I didn't do it when I had the chance. \n\nBut you get my drift.

Consider yourself fortunate they didn't require you have a licensed plumber to install that water heater.   
I would read up more on the financing crisis and the selling of mortgages.\n\nAlso I would argue that Republicans do the same thing regarding government.   Chop the budget/put poor leadership in charge, then blame the program for not working before defunding or axing it completely.
Time to bring the rule of law down upon OFA. They need consequences.
There's no doubt about it that President Obama has a shadow organization plotting and planning disruptions, protest, legal challenges, et al.\n\nLiberals will call you a tinfoil hat if you try to talk about it though.
The worst example in history is what happened in the great depression. Milton Friedman explained that the great depression was caused by the recently created federal reserve pursuing deflationary policy in the years leading up to it. The government then swooped in to save the day from "the failings of capitalism" by massively expanding the size and scope of government spending.
Which Democrats? I might have a skewed (unfortunately) perception of Democrats as a resident of one of the few states with a Democratic governor and state legislature, but as far as I'm aware, most Democrats around me (basically everyone besides me and a handful of others in my immediate circle) are applauding any attempt to undermine the Trump administration.\n\nI hope things are fairing better in other states.
In the city I live in Washington State we have the city government telling us which shopping bags to use.  And I had to put in a new water heater the other day, and my city now requires and inspection of the new water heater.  Pretty soon, I will need a permit to take a crap.  
How about a helicopter ride?
Democrats, especially at the state level, openly despise the OFA - Obama might think he's being clever but he could well be further destroying his party.       
This site is fucked 
Creating a crisis that people believe only the government could solve creates dependency.\n\nCreating a crisis from a lack of government creates self-sufficiency, independence, and innovation because everyone knows sitting around and waiting for the government to save them isn't an answer.\n\nI'm not in favor of the far ends of either practice, but I certainly favor the latter.
Lock him up!
I'd worry more about it if Obama had ever done anything successfully in his life other than run for political office. 
> but he could well be further destroying his party.\n\nOh well...
What about teddy Roosevelt and the bull moose party?
"I may not know the question at hand but, I do know the solution Big Government." -JFK probably
You are being too logical, sir.  Isn't that the essence of how progressivism builds upon itself? The government creates problems, blames someone else, the public who is now scared and uncertain, so they turn to government to save them from the crisis (that was created by said government).  We saw this recently with the housing bubble in 2008.  This all started via the Community Reinvestment Act, whereby the government used alleged racial discrimination (redlining) to ultimately force banks to create toxic loans to high risk recipients.  There's a train of events that happened beyond this, but it all boils down to the government usurpation of free market economics.  Banks weren't discriminating based on race, they were discriminating based on finances.  The market crashed and the blame was placed on the evil, greedy, capitalist banks who screwed everyone over.  Now, I'm not saying some banks didn't collude and make out like bandits, but they never would've been able to do so in a free market without the power of the government and the money printing of the Federal Reserve.  So the public cried out for the government to come down hard on evil, greedy Wall Street and the big bad banks.  Not only did we the people have to subsidize a bailout, we got Dodd-Frank - a massive set of new financial regulations.  So the government created a colossal problem, transferred enormous amounts of wealth (stole it), came in to "save the day" and empowered itself even more in the end. 
He always was such a classy guy (but then we've known this for years).
Yup.
A paragraph in the article accurately describes obama's behavior and is very interesting.\n\n"Obama has not only been trained in Saul Alinsky’s Rules for Radicals, but he’s familiar with  the crisis strategy theory of Richard Cloward and Frances Fox Piven, two neo-Marxists who taught at Columbia University, where Obama later studied. For Cloward and Piven, the left’s easiest route to socialist transformation is to overload the welfare state, which will trigger an insolvency crisis and financial collapse. U.S. Congressmen Steven King (R-Iowa) and Steve Stockman (R-Texas) have both gone on record, saying Obama was playing out of the Cloward-Piven theory by attempting to flood the border with illegals.”\n\nThis theory doesn't make sense to me.  We create a welfare state that collapses under its own weight.  To replace this welfare state, we replace it with a socialist welfare state?  What?  Why would an electorate ever choose to re-institute and double down on policies that failed?  The solution to socialistic policies failing is more socialism?  \n\n
> The solution to socialistic policies failing is more socialism?\n\nLook at Chicago.  Look at California.  Look at the Progs criticizing the 2009 Stimulus.  The argument they make is that things fail because they didn't go far enough, and only discarding the capitalist trappings, the individualist rights, in favor of going full socialism, will do.  Thats why they try to keep the trappings of modern society while undermining it, to make sure the current paradigm takes the blame.\n\nEdit: I'd also add that its a Year Zero kind of philosophy.  America can't be fixed or nudged into better.  We're too corrupt and evil and racist and clinging to our old ways.  We need to be torn down completely.  Existing government, religion, social structures, history, everything has to go so we can start fresh, engineered from the ground up by the enlightened folks who know whats best for us as a whole.  But *everything* has to burn first.
It was fucking awesome.
Fellow Californian?
Self-awareness is a good start. Doesn't seem to be all that present in the national chapter and the more deep blue states.
We live in a socialist Hellscape surrounded by morons who think one of the roles of government is to dictate what kind of shopping bag your grocery store can sell you for a ten cent vice tax.
That and if his plan was to "flood the border with illegals.” then he shouldn't have deported more people then any previous administration. 
He didn't.  The Obama admin. redefined deportations to include people turned away at the border.   
What about it? lol
> We create a welfare state that collapses under its own weight. To replace this welfare state, we replace it with a socialist welfare state?\n\nNah, it's more like this - we have existing welfare programs. You do things that increase people's need for these programs. The programs can't cope with the increased demand, so the response is to expand existing programs and create new ones. Repeat until we're full blown socialist.\n
> We create a welfare state that collapses under its own weight. To replace this welfare state, we replace it with a socialist welfare state?\n\nYou take one step at a time. Even the Democratic party wouldn't pass single payer healthcare in 2010 when they had a majority because some Dems were too moderate on the issue. So they passed Obamacare which is now failing and then the "easy" solution to the failing Obamacare is to pass single payer.
They apparently see it as a threat to the primacy of the DNC and at least partly blame it for the state level loses last year, nothing to do undermining Trump.

Actually, lobbying is a part of humanity. Have you ever asked your professor for an extension on an assignment? Boom. Lobbying. Lobbyists are just people paid to do it for a specific interest group. There is no bribery involved- they so much as buy lunch for a politician and they are in jail for the next decade. Lobbying exists in every level of government, and it's easy to tell the one crooked lobbyist from the 99 good ones. Lobbyists combat the law of unintended consequences. Take big oil, for example. People want to shut down the oil industry, and so when a politician suggests an anti oil bill, the lobbyist is the one who steps in and informs the politician that most of oil is owned by pension plans, and the only people who would get hurt are pensioners. Politicians can't know everything, so each lobbyist specializes in a particular field to prevent serious mistakes.

I think this is the first post I have seen that actually makes sense. I came here looking for this- people shouldn't be forced to divulge private information, regardless of whether or not it would be really nice to know. If we start outing one person, where will it end?

We have the Taco Bell naked chicken chalupa. Life is good.
I personally lean towards the delegate hat in most cases- less swayed by social media. In this case? It's actually not a hat that the house wears. The executive branch would handle whether or not personal information should be displayed, and checks within that branch exist if needed. The legislative branch should not work with this issue, except under the direction and authority of the executive branch. The delegate hat comes into play here- public opinion is that the information should be released. A trustee would push for it, but a delegate realizes that it's not their place to ask. A federal judge should issue a warrant or subpoena if they deem the information necessary, not the House.

I can do tomorrow's Weird Science Wednesday. My chemists have created a mix of jungle plant secretions that, when mixed together, harden earth or sand into something like glass, but of similar durability to steel. 
I will add that the bears ears monument, and the related escalante monument, are magnitudes larger than the state parks, and both were made partly to stick it to local republicans. They were created as political moves, knowing full well it would bother people.
I mean, if you are wondering, I know some Mormon missionaries that could help you... for a while the big three questions they worked off of where "where did I come from, why am I here, and where am I going after I die?"
Hot drinks has later been defined as coffee and tea, and even then only things that have actual coffee or actual tea (mint and stuff is fine, just not green/black tea). Mormons are a little nuts about their hot chocolate, which is totally allowed. The reasoning is similar to why Jewish people don't do pork; God said so. It will be interesting to note, though, that Mormons banned alcohol and tobacco at the same time, around the year 1840, putting it at about 100 years before anyone started saying tobacco was unhealthy.
Mormon leadership has explicitly stated that the prohibition only forbids coffee and tea, so in Mormon terms those judgey ones are "looking beyond the mark", or adding extra things just to keep themselves from going too far. Think new testament Pharisees. 
Take a look at HCR001, it's the bill that declares the intent of the legislature if they get the federal land and make it state land. The land will not be sold, only the rights to the coal and oil. Bears ears is huge compared to the biggest state park, and it was a breach of state sovriegnty to make it a monument. They are fine with parks and monuments, they just want to have a say in them. Actually, the author of HCR001 also has a bill making a new state park nearby.

Look up Brandon Sanderson- possibly the best worldbuilder in fiction. Mostly fantasy, but not in a "no rules, magic solves everything" sort of way. Otherwise try Larry Corriea- butcher and corriea have similar audiences, and butcher has actually written a short story in Corrieas universe. Specifically monster hunter international- a group of monster attack survivors form a company that kills monsters and collects payment from the government for it.

The term is "ambisinister", Dexter meaning right and Sinister meaning left. As in Ambidextrous means both hands are essentially your right hand, and Ambisinister means both hands are essentially your left hand. Horribly discriminatory and all that.\n

Very little has occurred because of the inclement weather in Skralia. The underground dens are reinforced with Terran steel, leaving the homes effectively untouched except for some minor flooding, easily remedied. Many trees have fallen, and cleanup will commence once it is safe.
Most, of course. But it's a different situation- legally, you have to be a natural born US citizen to be president. The rumored discrepancy between his certificate and his transcript would suggest an issue with his status. There is nothing legally binding about a request to release tax returns. If we were to start releasing private information, where would it end? It sets a poor precedence. 
I don't remember the title, but is it a world where everyone has a parallel? And if you move to the other world, That world's version of you gets pulled into your world?

You don't hear about them on the news. Usually a good sign that they actually care and aren't just there for publicity.
Again, devoutness isn't the issue. There's what we are told to do, and what other people feel like adding. It's Mormon tradition, not Mormon doctrine.

Every president since Nixon, actually, and it wasn't tradition before that. So... five, six people? It looks bad, I agree, but personally I really don't want people forcing me to divulge private information without a warrant. I don't want something like this becoming okay, and this would start that. 
Not what OP meant. The Aleutian Islands of Alaska actually cross the international date line. Looking at a traditional map you will see Alaska on the far west, and the tail of Alaska on the Far East.

Pragmatism
Plenty of Christian sects are (flagellation being a more extreme example) but Mormons, despite common belief, are not. Sure, they abstain from premarital sex, but not just cause it's fun, and sex definitely isn't just to have kids. It's just something treated as sacred, specifically to increase the relationship between husband and wife. It's totally allowed to be fun. The TV/Computer thing is just for Mormons who have missed the whole point. It's not about not having pleasure, it's about finding pleasure in good things- your family, helping other people, learning and growing. The Mormon religion is based on becoming better than you currently are, trying to become more like God. "Men are that they might have joy" is actually a Mormon scripture.

The original show was really terrific. The humor was completely cut from the movie.
"The Last Airbender" by M. Night Shyamalan.
I came here exactly to say this. His magic has rules that make far more sense than anything else. Worlds of magic and wonder that somehow eliminate the threat of deus ex machina? Brilliantly done, and the various series allow you to find a system you prefer, even though they are all still connected.
While Mormons have an open canon, the most recent "Set-in-stone"  stuff is what is linked in this tread already (D&C 89), which says hot drinks and continues on with things like be sure to exercise. Another Mormon peculiarity is a belief that God has not ceased talking to men, meaning that the semi-annual General Conference is treated effectively as scripture. Prophets, like in the old testament, still exist, and in similar leadership capacities. When I say leadership, i mean these prophets acting in official capacities, which is effectively scripture.
Mormons aren't anti-pleasure, though

I would just like to point out the first rule of politics- nothing is ever as good or as bad as it seems. D.C. Isn't full of corruption, there are good people in both parties. The pay cuts most politicians take to serve the public is shocking. That's all I'm going to say, because looking through this thread it's pretty hostile towards any differing opinion. I'm only saying anything on yours because you seem halfway sensible, rather than simply freaking out about hunting people down and creating a new world order free of things like a right to privacy.

If it's determined that it something they need? Sure. But just having a vote to force someone really just isn't right. Anyone with an excuse could go "he donated to xxx and I don't like them!

The president should be looking out for the best interests of our country, not Russia's. Putin has put himself in position to be eternal president, unabashedly ties his businesses to the government to make as much money as possible, and bribes or kills those who speak out against him. There's no part of that we want our president involved in.
That one line that much of a killer for you?
There's two trains of thought along those lines- congressmen act sometimes as delegates, sometimes as trustees. Delegates are people we trust to make choices we don't understand, or that we don't realize we don't understand. Trustees reflect the will of the people. One is more "aristocratic", with its flaws and advantages, the other is more "democratic", with its flaws and advantages. So yes, they do represent their constituents, but sometimes they have to decide that the constituents are operating on bad information or a conceptual misunderstanding of the consequences of political will. Look at bush- vilified for going into Iraq, but the move was the popular opinion at the time. There, he should have acted as one delegated to make choices for us, rather than someone trusted to follow our opinion. I hope that helps! 
The Skralian council agrees to these terms, but questions if the prohibitions against hoarding money is focused on governments or private entities.

I think in *your* example that his hypocritical. But again, this is an anti-trump sub. Not a pro-clinton sub. So i'd say that's the difference. The reverse is true as well, Trumppers spent the whole election talking about Bill/Epstein but completely wrote off Trump's connection with him. Well Trump is president now so saying 'But bill and hillary!' in response to Trump's shady connections is as ridiculous as clinton supporters doing the same. It's only more relevent now because Trump is in the white house.

[Dude's such a poser.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dySI7lckA1Y&t=79m58s) Stuckman is so far out of his depth its hard to listen to. But it's stark to see him talk to someone who is actually passionate about something. Here's the transcript:\n\n> **Stuckman:** "I gotta ask you a quick question, musical question- music related. Are you at all into like classic rock or 80s guitar, solo...band...type deal?"\n\n> **Fantano:** "Uh I-I think so. Yeah, I mean what band in your opinion sort of fits that description"\n\n> **Stuckman:** "So there is a song that- and a band that I feel is very underrated and uh a music artist in general- his names Mark Knopfler uh the lead singer of dire straights in the 80s. And he did a song called 'sultans of swing' and if you ever feel like listening to like an 11 minute guitar orgasim check that out. The live alchemy  version of sultans of swing. The final 4 minutes I- I just get goosebumps its amazing."\n\n> *awkward pause*\n\n> **Fantano:** "That's awesome. Does that track take a jazz tone as well?"\n\n> **Stuckman:** "No, its hard core- not hardcore though but I- it's justl like- just kind of..."\n\n> **Fantano:** "Just straight rock?"\n\n> **Stuckman:** "Yeah um, he's not the best singer on earth but his lyrics are very meaningful if you look into them and read into them. But his control of the guitar is godly. Like I have- people always talk about Jimmi Hendrix or Stevie Ray Vaughn and i'm always like Mark Knopfler man he really knows his shit."

I found this pretentious and shallow. \n\nIt's pseudo intellectual over-analyzation of basic fps online multiplayer tropes that have been around for years is cringey as fuck. 3/4ths of the video could have been about TF2. \n\nI love Overwatch but *gameplay* is the strong suit not story telling. As interesting as their characters/environments can be, there's no reason given for any of those matches to take place. So if anything it's weak point since every single battle is non-canon and disconnected from the story of the world the game is supposed to take place in.
It's a lack of access. It's an administration putting distance between themselves and media outlets they disagree with in a way that is unparalleled. If you ask me every administration should be scrutinized. There's no way this isn't a problem. Whatever fallacious or biased articles have been posted by CNN regarding Trump, Fox did the same against Obama. For all his faults, Obama never barred Fox from the briefing room. No president has ever done something like this.\n\nIf you are okay with this, ask yourself if you would be okay if Obama banned Fox from the briefing room on the justification it was "fake news" so it's fine. Would you be okay with that? Of course you wouldn't. 
Dinosaur can't get cancer. Check mate Spiderman
Look man, I don't want to be an asshole or anything. I didn't honestly expect you to see my comment, although those are my true feelings about it. It's a valiant effort and I don't want to discourage anyone from trying to peel back the layers of well designed games. I enjoy that kind of content (KaptainKristian and such) so I'm all for it and I think you should keep at it.\n\nBut I just think you've missed the mark. I agree with the guy above- you've mixed up 'personal narrative' with 'story.' Overwatch does a lot of things right but I don't think you really got into the meat of what those  things are or why they work. You never told me why Overwatch does it better. You just talked about how the level design/experience is similar to a story for the player. But because 9/10s of those design choices in the game are there because they work (because they've been any many other games before Overwatch) it's not telling me anything. Why is Overwatch's time in the spawn room a better 'story experience' then TF2's? or Planetsides? or Left 4 Deads? Why is it's deadspace better? None of these questions are answered.\n\nI understand you were trying to make the distinction between the lore of the game and the player experience but I don't think you can count that out. Especially if you're opening your video talking about how games are more immersive because players get to inhabit the experiences of world leaders (in civ) or god like city architects (in cities). Part of immersion, part of the personal narrative and the story of the player, is tied to the lore and story of the game. People like the characters in Overwatch. Partially because they are fun to play, sure. But also some people just love Bastion. After his backstory and that short they put out, who wouldn't? The story/lore is an attraction for some players. Just like when you play Metal Gear you ARE Solid Snake, you have all his abilities and skills. If you fail it's not because Solid Snake failed it's because YOU failed. So for people who invest in that world- the disconnect between playing Winston and killing your friend Tracer over some vaguely defined objective does hurt the game and by extension the experience as a whole. The gameplay is really fun it doesn't matter much, it doesn't kill it. But if you're a fan of Winston and you ARE Winston it does hurt the immersion. To at least some extent (ideally) level design, game mechanics, character interaction, AND story should all work together. Overwatch does suffer from that. It is one thing I think Tf2 does better. It really leans into the game. If you love the story and world of Tf2 you can play a round of it and not lose that full sense of immersion.
Let's be real, the plot of the Halo games is always terrible. Master Chief as a character is often downright cringey. Co-op/multiplayer is what makes it work.
He got caught in 2005. You think he just started doing it that year? He's been accused of these same things since the early 90s. It's true the quote is not proof of anything, but it is suspect. The fact that he said it before the guy got caught is meaningless considering his history.
Or the time he was on a podcast with Anthony Fantano and recommended he check out a unknown little song called 'sultans of swing' by dire straights. Dude makes me roll my eyes so hard they practically fall out of my head. I've never understood how he got remotely popular. 
i'm dumb
Hypocritical how? Once again this isn't a pro-clinton sub. So what are you getting at? I won't defend Bill, I didn't even vote for Hillary. If Bill was actually involved in banging underage girls then I hope he's caught. But Trump is as corrupt and has more suspicious connections then either of them. And he's president so it's kind of relevant. 
So? That doesn't make it suddenly legal. It certainly doesn't mean I don't have sympathy for people in that situation. But that doesn't change the fact it's my job (and others) to make sure it doesn't happen for very understandable reasons. \n\nKeep in mind too this guy went far beyond sleeping in it. I've met plenty of people who actually had no where else to go, trust me they couldn't afford a 4k TV. There's a huge difference between people who have nothing and illegally wiring up the place 'for fun' and putting other peoples shit and danger like he did.
> Reading tweets and hearing him speak do not equate to knowing anything about him.\n\nRe-read that and examine how far you will go to ignore the man's faults. You can literally go on youtube and watch hours and hours of him talking. You can find books and interviews where he goes in depth to explain how he thinks about all kinds of topics. His outlook on life and what he thinks the worlds problems are and how to fix them. That's not enough information for you to make a judgement on his character?\n\nBy your definition you have no right to judge any politician ever (or anyone that you aren't personally friends with), for any reason, because you don't know their character unless you personally know them. You want to stick to that?
Yeah, the guy who cries about the media being mean to him and can't handle saturday night live is real mature.
Yes. And I'm sure you don't own a single object that has sentimental value to you.
Another empty superficial "review" from Stuckmann. How does anyone listen to this guy.
There's no way you can seriously say people have forgotten Toxic.
Dude what are you smoking? We know beyond a shadow of a doubt there was zero concrete evidence of WMD's when Cheney was on fox saying the exact opposite. Read the UK Iraq War report, the downing street memos, and intelligence reports which have been released since then. Michael Morell (Who briefed W and Cheny for the CIA) straight up said that when Cheney said that Saddam had nuclear weapons they knew it wasn't true. [Source Around the 4 Minute Mark](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVvzg7nznTw) Going on to say that:\n\n"What they were saying about the link between Iraq and Al Qaeda publicly was not what the intelligence community. I think they were trying to make a stronger case for the war."\n\nCheney and Bush lied dude. It's a fact.
Sadly, you're misinformed. He went to Yaroslavl, the sister city of the Burlington of which he was the mayor of at the time. He did a lot of really romantic things with a delegation of 12 like diplomatic meetings and an interview Alexander Ryabkov the head of the city's executive committee (the closest things the soviets had to a mayor). Go ahead and ignore the fact that the date had been set ahead of time and they didn't want to move the date of their wedding. Or that his program still exists and is in effect today. Ignore the fact that his reference to it as a 'honeymoon' was obviously and clearly a bit of light hearted sarcasm. You don't need facts or anything.\n\nSeriously though, hate sanders all you want but at least do it for legitimate and informed reasons.\n\n(the fact that this comment got downvoted is proof yall are no better then /r/politics. you can't get mad when the dems mischaracterizes something trump says or does but then be fine to do it back. there are good reasons to criticize sanders but this is not one of them.)
Once again, the guy who posted this video was not in need. He's not in a desperate situation. And he had other places to go. He said in this thread he partially just did it for fun. I have met these people. I've worked with these people. I've helped a lot of these people out. But the ones who truly need to live in a storage unit because they have literally nowhere else to go don't waste time hooking up a 4K TV and a hot plate.\n\n They come in they sleep and try to be as inconspicuous as possible. There's a huge difference between sleeping there because you have nowhere else to go, which is still illegal, and doing it for funsies and karma. Especially doing it in a way where it puts not just stuff at risk but op's life, in the life of anyone else who may enter that building. Fire hazard isn't a joke. And by the way it is my job, I am paid, to make sure these people stuff is safe. My job is not to provide housing. I sympathize very much with the people who feel like they need to do that but he is not one of those people and what's shown in this video is highly dangerous. Not to mention he seriously fucked over the people that were nice enough to let him stay there. This guy is exactly the reason why people don't get to sleep in storage units who really need to. He's ruined it for them. So if you really care for people who feel like they have nowhere else to go other than a storage unit you should be against this video as well because the managers who let him do this for trying to do him a solid and they are most likely getting fired because he wanted to have internet points
Lol. You think he put his businesses in a blind trust? He absolutely did not. 
There's a huge fucking difference between talking to a country and placating/appeasing a dictator.
I made no comment about either one of them beyond the fact that they are fundamentally different. But don't let that get in the way of your rage boner.
The serious answer is Mexico isn't expected to literally cut a check for a wall. The money is supposed to come from corporate tax reform imposed on Mexico with or without their consent.\n\nIt's still monumentally stupid but I thought you deserved an actual response.
Well three million people is a pretty big difference.
He did actually. Which only adds to the tragedy of the timing of his death. Read the fill playboy interview. Him and Julian were closer then they'd ever been when he died. It wasn't perfect but they were working on it and making progress for the first time ever. Stop talking about shit you know nothing about.
Fair point.
> a war on masculinity\n\nwhat reality do you live in? no one is trying to repress your masculinity. the fact that you feel the need to feel victimized is pathetic. 
Good god that line up sucks. Why does the hand on the poster look like each individual muscle took steroids independent of one another?
I'm not going to pretend to be an expert on trade but my understanding is that while yes our trade deficit with Mexico is a big scary number you can't look at it by itself. But part of the reason it's gone up since NAFTA is because we are importing and exporting more then ever. So while the trade deficit has gone up we've also added an averagr $193 billion in exports *annually.*\n\nIn 2015 we exported $236 billion to Mexico. That's $236 billion that went to American businesses. and economists generally say that's how it should be.\n\n["You'd rather have $10 worth of exports and $15 worth of imports than $8 of both and no trade deficit. If higher imports are the product of unfair trade practices, and those products could be reasonably made here, shrinking the trade deficit makes sense, but not if shrinking the trade deficit comes at the expense of export growth."](https://www.axios.com/nafta-blew-up-the-u-s-trade-deficit-with-mexico-2216441142.html)\n\nDon't be fooled, a 20% tax increase hurts us just as much as it hurts them. It makes things more expensive for us as consumers, it makes life worse in Mexico as they have to cutback- this unemployment rises- thus more people are likely to want to leave, and it will also put American businesses out of business because some companies won't be able to afford a 20% increase in expenses. Keep in mind too not everything we import from Mexico is because it's cheap. Sometimes it's also just the best place to buy something.\n\nWorst of all it could imagine if it incites a trade war. (It would). Things like that is literally a main factor in causing the great depression.\n\nWould some jobs be created by constructing a wall? Sure. But should we build a bridge to nowhere just to pay people to work on it? The amount of jobs that would be created from the wall construction would pale in comparison to the jobs lost as a result of a trade war. \n\nHonestly, I love the debate and really appreciate the civil conversation. So you'll excuse me if I say fuck that wall ;) 
Yea, no.
A wall would have very little impact on the cartels. They get most of their drugs through via the ocean. Not to mention tunnels, drones, private planes. 
Putin. You moron. 
Yeah, I like whataburger but in-and-out beats it everytime. 
A pizza place doesn't really qualify. It's usually used in restaurants with servers. I've never heard it used in fast food places.
Go to the worst neighborhood in any major city and you'll find the same. What are you going to do, set up a military checkpoint on every street forever? Babysit them until they learn their lesson? 
> People upset over draft dodging who would dodge a draft started by President Trump\n\nWhat are you even talking about? Some hypothetical situation you made up? Because Trump *actually* dodged the draft. That really happened.
Considering he's been golfing 6 times in his first month I don't really think the Obama golf thing works anymore.
Prison school. Not that cute though
The wall would have very little impact on the cartels. We already have walls/fences along easily traversible parts of the border. Most cartels get drugs in the US via water. \n\n"well over 95% of the drugs are moving on the water via container ships, non-commercial vessels, pleasure boats, sail boats, fishing boats."

Stop repeating this lie. If you to throw more money at border security, do it by all means but a wall would be nothing but a $15 billion dollar money hole. It has no tangible practical benefits.  
what a trash post
That was legitimately revolting. Do you have any actual reason to believe that's John Podesta. For what little I could stomach it sounded nothing like him.
He won't make it 2
Probably not *exactly* pop but 2005's [HIM - Wings of a Butterfly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_81phxrRJLs) will bring back some memories for people who were in high school at the time.
So you ordered the wrong thing and it's their fault?
The media is hurting trumps feeling. He's demoralized! JUST LEAVE HIM ALONE! THEY ARE SO MEAN!\n\n-sean spicer for the last 5 minutes
I agree when we are talking about restaurants that have waiters or waitresses. Never once heard it used in a fast food/pizza place.   
Except the largest one and the one responsible for 9/11. Saudi Arabia. What a farce. You guys don't see that as a huge red flag?
No. Nobody on this television based subreddit thinks either of those two incredible popular comedies are funny.
I see that you also browsed /r/movies yesterday.
Fair enough! It annoyed me probably more then it should because I try to help out people as much as I can. Look the other way when I need to and I've gotten screwed before and that's exactly what he's doing to the people who helped him out.
Except most illegals don't walk over the border. They come on planes and then over stay their visas. Most illegal drugs come on boats across the ocean. More to the point a 20% import/export tax would *increase* illegal immigration because you're making life harder for the Mexican people. If their businesses close and they can't find jobs then they will come over here. Not only is it useless the manner in which it's supposed to be paid for will increase the very thing it's supposed to stop.
A warzone? Chicago has problems but a warzone? Hyperbole much??
You know a whole two sentences regarding the situation. He had plenty of opportunity and lots of people trying to help him (including me). Killing yourself doesn't suddenly make you a flawless human being. As tragic and depressing as it was he wasn't thinking about anyone but himself when he did it and caused a lot of people a lot of pain well beyond my "ruined evening" (words you put in my mouth).\n\nThe fact that you would assume so much and judge so easily a situation you know nothing about so you can feel self-righteous is appalling. Truly vile. 
FAKE QUOTE right?
I'd like to see the studies if you have a link
> dissenting through cordial debate \n\nDo you really think that's how the Republicans handled it? How they treated the Supreme Court nomination was indefensible. They should have given him a fair crack at it and voted against him if they had an issue with the choice. The government shutdown. Birtherism. The walkouts. \n\nI'm not defending all the dem's actions here but let's not pretend the republicans were any nicer.
This is /r/lewronggeneration material. Did you storm the beaches of Normandy? No? Then don't denigrate others for excercising their right to peaceful protest. You can't cherry pick shit from history to make yourself feel good. A bunch of men protested desegregation (with plenty of signs) but you didn't decide to compare that to the women's march did you? Of course not. This is as self mastabatory as a post can get. 
Those kids shes talking about are her own children. And they're talking about having the pool heated because it was in October. But go ahead! You don't need the truth to believe some bullshit!
I'll try and dig it up tomorrow. They thought of the wall as more symbolic in that they want to get back to stopping the drug traffickers and such and stop feeling like a welcoming party. 
You're right on. The dude is so fucking articulate and well informed. That's the kind of guy I want to hear reviews from. Fantano is truly passionate about music and it shows. \n\nStuckmann just wants to be able to stick his head up his own ass. He's in it for the adulation and attention. 
The best way to destroy cartel influence would be to legalize marijuana. You also get the added benefit of not ruining people's lives by throwing them in jail for non-violent offenses. A wall will have little effect on immigration. It's been trending downward for a decade and as others have pointed out, the majority of people just overstay their visas. There is no such thing as an 'impassable wall.' There's a podcast you can listen to that's run by border agents and even the ones who support Trump think the wall will be useless. They told a story about a part of the border where they put up an 18 foot wall and the next day they found 19 foot ladders resting up against it. It'll just be a giant expensive piece of shit that does nothing and drains cash to maintain and man (if it gets congressional approval.)
Shocker, /u/RaidensDad was full of shit just like his namesake.
How has Mexico been taking advantage of us? Real question. \n\nI'm don't want to be disrespectful but these are all Trump's own talking points and it sounds like you drank the koolaid. We have nothing left to lose? How about the billions of dollars it would cost? Do you have any idea how much a 20% increase in trade taxes would hurt us? Look at the causes of the great depression. It would hurt oud economy and there's. If shit gets worse over there they are only going to be more inclined to come over here. Saying he's made deals before so I'll trust him isn't good practice. Look at history. We have everything to lose and nothing to gain by building a wall.
**Except you know, this guy in the video.** Which is the whole point. He straight up says in this thread he did it for fun and he had other places he could have stayed.\n\nAlso lol at the idea that: adequate shelter =/= creating a fire hazard by jerry rigging a 4k tv, hotplate, and a dozen other electronics into a space that wasn't built to live in. It put not just 'stuff' in danger but his life but his life and the life of anyone else who could have entered that building. But since you're so self-righteous why don't you go down the street and invite some homeless guys to live at your place?
Not really the same. Mst3k is designed to be reincarnated with new hosts kind of like Doctor Who. It's not trying to revive the magic-in-bottle chemistry of a cast that hasn't been together in years or prop up a story that can't really be supported by an aging cast.
I've never seen any remotely compelling pizza gate evidence. \n\nEspecially the spirit cooking stuff- Marina Abramovic is a weird avante garde artist that has been doing weird art shit for like 40 years. If you know anything about her or that world you know the difference between avante garde performance art and actual occultism.\n\nThe 'torture chamber' thing seems absurd. The idea is they have this deep underground community of pedophiles hiding behind code words and business fronts but they call their 'torture chamber' simply 'torture chamber'? That's the problem with going through someones e-mails. He could have just as easily been talking about a fucking meeting he didn't want to be in.\n\nI would like to see the 'voice analysis' though so feel free to share that.

Rockstar at E3 isn't going to happen. T2 is always there. We'll likely get some info before then.
Totally disagree. The fact that they haven't changed much is part of the problem. They  flirted with change in Capaldi first season. I loved when he was briefly the grumpier, scarier and more mysterious doctor they keep pretending he is.. But by his second season he's pretty much interchangable with Matt Smith. Capaldi himself is really brilliant. But he's honestly had one truly great episode (heaven sent). I do think they really brought him down by horrible companions. I could write a book on how fucking awful Clara was. The shows preoccupation with making her special really hurt. So I do hope he's better now that she's gone. But so many plotlines went nowhere. So many boilerplate episodes. Even this trailer is almost identical to almost every doctor who trailer since it came back. Some variation of "travelling with the doctor is....." Ad nesuem. I'm a big fan of moffat early stuff. His first couple years were great but it seems like he's been on autopilot for a long time.
Good lord he's easily agitated. Seriously, these questions are nothing compared to whats going to come. The next few years are going to be nuts.
Fark --> Digg --> Reddit
fixed
That clock is broken. It was broken then and it's still broken now. It's really not hard to figure this stuff out. It's not a conspiracy. Less people went to Trump's inauguration. Fact. It's time to get over it. Whether or not you like him he's divisive and unpopular with a lot of people.
I love Capaldi but I think it's been an awful era for the show. A real slag writing wise. He deserved a chance to work under some fresh writers.
The southern border already is militarized. A wall would do almost nothing to improve it other then be a giant money sink. That money is better spent on so many other things even... if you want to use it on border security to further militarized it, a wall is the dumbest way to do it.  
Baseball bat to the knee who thinks that's ever ok. But I guess they can kill without a care in the world if it fits their narrative. 
Please fix invite system I'm dying. 
Just to get it out of the way "My hero academia"

The Prime Minister loaned it to W, it was always meant to be returned at the end of his term. Trump just asked to borrow it again for headlines. Completely moronic it was ever a thing. \n\n\n"The bust in question, by British sculptor Jacob Epstein, was given to President George W Bush by the British government in 2001 and was placed in the Oval Office. But the statue was not donated, it was simply on loan for Bush’s term in office (a loan which the British government decided to extend when Bush was re-elected in 2004). "\n\n"Sir Peter Westmacott [former British Ambassador] said the bust was only ever on loan as a personal gift from Tony Blair to George W Bush for the duration of his presidency."\n\n"President Obama confirmed that there was a [separate] bust of Churchill in the White House residence outside of his office."\n\n[Source](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/apr/22/barack-obama-winston-churchill-bust-oval-office-britain) 
> You don't know a single goddamn thing about Donald Trump's character.\n\nLol. What a load of shit. Yes, we do. Read his tweets. Look at his response to things going on around him. Listen to the words that come out of his mouth.\n\nThis gif doesn't tell you anything in a vaccum. By itself it would mean nothing. But combined with everything else we know about him personally (even ignoring his policies) it tells you a lot. 
This is what indoctrination sounds like
I'm not really opposed to border security. If you want to throw more money at border security I won't complain. I'd argue the problem is massively overblown as illegal immigration has been doing nothing but going down over the last decade and most illegal immigrants who do come over do so on planes but OK. Seriously the fact that he built a campaign around it is pure fearmongering. Anyways I digress...\n\nIf the wall doesn't actually put a meaningful dent into either the cartels or illegal immigration then it should be easy to understand why most people think a 15+ billion dollar 'symbol' is fucking stupid.\n\n 
> you would have to filter out every lie from both anti and pro-Trump supporters\n\nYou act that like the only footage that exists of him comes from through news media. You can watch uncensored interviews with him. You can watch his uncensored rallies. You can read his tweets directly. All of those are things that come directly from his mouth. I'm not denying there's news bias on both sides, of course there is. But there is still plenty out there to judge his character. His words and his actions are on display, raw and uncensored all over the internet.\n\nWhile he may have be president for only a few weeks he's been in the public eye for 30 years. We've seen him say what he would do if her were elected, and for the past two weeks we've seen him try to do some of those things. Then we've seen him respond to it on twitter. How much time do you deem must pass before someone can make a judgement about his character?
Yeah, going to the moon seems silly right now. They should be going to mars if they're going to put up that kind of money.
Because his handshakes are bizarrely [aggressive](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r5jJ2543T0A) and people find that notable.
It's not the fact that it's firm. It's how bizarrely aggressive it is. I agree a strong/firm handshake is good habit to be in especially for a business man. But i've never in my life seen someone shake hands the way Trump does. He practically [yanks the other guy to the ground](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r5jJ2543T0A&t=0m29s) and then swings his hand back and forth like his arm is a saw cutting through an oak tree. Have you ever seen anyone do that?\n\nMany people see it as disrespectful. I can't say I blame them. Whether you like him or not it's fucking weird.
Moffat still steers the ship and sets the tone.
Kinda sad you don't seem to understand the difference between communism and socialism.
Here's the exact transcript:\n\n"I just start kissing them. It's like a magnet. Just kiss. **I don't even wait.** And when you're a star **they let you do it.** You can do anything...Grab them by the pussy. You can do anything."\n\nI understand people are attracted to money and stardom. But there's a difference between women throwing themselves at someone and this. He's literally saying 'I don't even wait' what is it you think he's referring to? He says they 'let you' not they invite you. Come on man. I don't care how much you agree with the guy politically that shit is unacceptable. Having lots of money doesn't suddenly give you the right to just start kissing someone or grabbing their genitals without waiting for consent.
God you're even stupider then I thought you were. The only positive to having Trump is I'll laugh my ass off when you idiots finally see the damage he's done. Maybe if you dislodge Trump's cock from your throat you could think straight. But instead you'll keep ignoring facts so you can fuel a baseless hatred for illegal immigrants. \n\nNice construction line though. Next time you want an insult make sure you check with the_donald first though. Lord knows you are incapable of doing anything besides absent mindedly repeating the party lines. Libtard! Cuck! 
It's not just on the company, it's a violation of the lease he signed. There are actual multiple violations of the lease in the video. So it is totally on him. They are unlikely to do anything about it at this point of course but I bet if they really wanted to they could. But the managers are fucked. (not that he cares).
You always run back to Clinton. But i've got news for you Anti-trump =/= Pro-clinton. Epstein has been accused of wrong doing since the early 90s, just because he wasn't caught until 2005 doesn't mean it didn't happen prior to that. It's not proof of anything but it is definitely suspect. It's just as much to go on as anything from pizzagate.\n\nPlus it doesn't work regardless because the flights Bill took with Epstein were also during 2002-2003 "before he was accused of any wrong doing" so that exonerates him right?
Whoever thought the president of the united states *not* tweeting in the middle of the night would be news?
One thing people forget is that even if tariff raise the price of some goods the initial cost to the wall comes form Mexico. The Key part is that we aren't printing the money creating increase inflation instead we can use their money.

I'm confused what are you all complaining about. Because all I see is that voting system is incredible slow or won't remove people form the register eg. Dead people or people no longer residents. And he didn't even vote in two states. It just proves how easy voter fraud can be done. 
You can easily speculate where gang activity is occurring but, you see have to see the act of a crime before you can make an arrest or get a warrant to search. And getting a warrant when you only have an idea of what's going on is impossible but, criminal illegal immigrant is a great starting point since it's a know fact.

Don't want to really get into this right now but, I'll give some key factors. \n\nPopulation- most countries like UK, Canada, and Germany don't have the numbers compared to the US or land mass\n\nWait times- In those countries check ups and minor problems are quick and free but, major problems that need to be diagnosed with scans etc you hit waiting list and priority queues. \n\nGovernment sucks- If you look into the pass you can see that government interference usually fucks shit up more often then not. From rail road lines to health care system usually they make things worst overall. And a good example of government Healthcare within the US is the VA and their garbage at what they do.

Well the whole point of conservatism is limited government so you don't have to think about that question. However Obama if anything expand the powers of government and Trump isn't the most conservative person. But if he really wants to drain the swamp as he says then we might be going into the direction of little government interference. But it's a toss up.

Sometimes law enforcement won't do a part of their job if the end result is the person being released and more paper work. Border patrol and ICE are good example Border patrol could stop you from entering but if you got across you were good (unless you are carry contraban) and ICE probably already knew where a lot of criminal illegal aliens were but didn't have the backing to deport them.

The best way of voting is were the popular vote is closely align with the ideology of a group. A pure democracy doesn't work with a large and varying population because interest of minority groups is almost completely lost. The system we have now can be improved only if we start splitting the electoral votes. Like Maine and Nebraska.

Shhh they don't exist just like the black or gay conservatives.

Personally I like the "inaudible screeching" with the original endings text. 
I'm a Christian but my thought is that the freedom of religion is the right to believe whatever you want as long as you're not killing people. The danger of attacking religion is that the more you attack it the closer we get to a world where thought crime is a thing. And shitlibs already hate you for your ideas or how you perceive the world. 
Law probably exist to seize firearms and other tools that might be personal owned. 
Dumbledore can see Harry under the cloak, and it's for the same reason Moody can see him - Dumbledore enchanted his glasses, and Moody's fake eye, with the Elder Wand. \n\nIn terms of the Marauders Map, I don't see why Harry *wouldn't* show up on it - it's an invisibility cloak, not "you're undetectable cloak."
I don't think these rankings are accurate. Another ranking came out from the state this week, and my local district was in the top 10. It is unranked in these rankings...
Not sure; it's an explanation I saw on reddit before. But makes a whole lot of sense.
So you think speeding is a greater offense than illegally entering the borders of a sovereign nation? Interesting.\n\n> are 'worse' than illegal immigration which ,as I mentioned, is a net benefit for American Society\n\n*Illegal* immigration is a benefit, or I guess more specifically, a *greater* benefit than legal immigration? \n\nGoes back to the whole thing where some folks seem to be incapable of distinguishing the two, and seem to think opposition to illegal immigration equates to opposition to immigration generally.\n\n
Yeah, like I said in my original post, don't know technically what to call it.
That's those animals also have a disorder.
Reminds me of Thomas' dissent in Lawrence -\n\n> I write separately to note that the law before the Court "is uncommonly silly." If I were a member of the Texas Legislature, I would vote to repeal it... Notwithstanding this, I r3cognize that as a Member of this Court I am not empowered to help petitioners and others similarly situated. My duty, rather, is "to decide cases agreeably to the Constitution and laws of the United States."
> And not everyone qualifies for loans\n\nYeah, actually everyone does. Unless they have rich parents.
Well, they currently have 22 committed recruits, so only 3 more scholarships. Well technically I think 6, because 3 guys have already enrolled and we're counted against last year's total.
You know you have a great argument when you need to digress to personal insults
He'll, let's crank it up to 122! Christie Brinkley (63) and Shannon Tweed (59, wife of Gene Simmons from KISS)
Well, I don't know if "genetic disorder" would be the technical term. But in terms of natural selection, things that make an organism less likely to survive and reproduce are bad things. \n\nIf someone is gay they are much less likely to reproduce, since obviously sex with the opposite sex (apart from recent medical stuff) is required to reproduce. 
What do you mean "can't afford it?" You get loans...
College is expensive. So expensive than some qualified eople choose not to attend. \n\nBut it wasn't always that expensive. Why has the expense grown dramatically in the last 40 years? The government decided that students should be eligible for loans - nondischargable loans. This increased the supply of potential tuition dollars, and colleges responded by increasing the cost.\n\nSo, rather than "solving" this government-created problem with another government program, why not just restrict the amount of student loans that are nondischarable?
Or, you know, just don't require business to provide Healthcare to its employees. Regardless of size.
Why should businesses be required to provide anything?\n
I didn't say it should be illegal. On the contrary, I would be extremely opposed to any sort of sodomy law, etc. 
Yes, it would be simpler if that wasn't the case.
I am not worried that humanity won't survive because of homosexuals.\n\nBut, from a natural selection, evolutionary, whatever you want to call it perspective, homosexuals have a trait that makes them less likely to reproduce. That is generally seen as a bad thing.
What exactly? The form thing? I mean, he signed something, just at that moment he didn't real give a shit what it said.\n\nI think that some girls who've appeared on GGW have sued, saying that were incapacitated (drunk) and therefore unable to legally consent to the taping.
Well, I seem to recall a number of terrorist attacks over the last year, but whatever...\n\n> legally and viably\n\nWhat do you mean by "viably"?
And again, why should the federal government be funding that?
Good get VaTech. Was hoping Illinois could keep him in-state..\n
I'm not saying that homosexuals "are a failure." They can certainly live full, productive, and happy lives without reproducing. 
So anyone should just be able to move anywhere?
> one should NOT wear the flag\n\nTechnically, people aren't "wearing the flag." They're wearing a t-shirt or whatever that has the same design as the flag.
Makes sense. She was no longer a student. 
So basically, without net neutrality Comcast could give preferential speed to certain sites (for a fee of course)? And/or the opposite, Comcast could slow down sites which don't pay a fee?
That does clear it up a bit, but I still think it's really splitting hairs.
Rumor was that he didn't qualify at Illinois. Hence going from a top 3 that just had illinois, to a top 3 of Oregon, Louisville and Miami.\n\nWith Miami and Illinois tied at 44 in US NEWS rankings, I imagine their admission standards are similar...\n
I don't see how that's relevant to the topic.
Well, then we're not really talking about "free" trade.
I do think it's too bad, that our system isn't perfect, and some minority rights can get violated. 
Thanks for the info, but doubt I'll ever use one. I'm  (relatively) young and healthy, haven't spent anything on health care  (besides premiums) in about 5 years. Not going to stash money away to sit there.\n
> Everyone has a right to an education\n\nExcept they don't. If your school district decides it's just closing down the school, you would have no constitutional recourse.\n
I think I don't really understand what's so great about HSAs. I mean, I save money anyways. Obviously the tax benefit is great, but why the multiple accounts? Why not just let me take money out of my IRA or whatever? I have no idea how much I'm going to spend on health care.\n\nWhat am I missing?\n
What about them?
> It's what arms consisted of and it's what "arms" meant. \n\nSo I guess you don't think the 1A applies to the internet? Or that's different, because you think free speech is a "good" right and the right to bear arms is a "bad" one?\n\n> The same logic should apply to the 14th Amendment. All persons are guaranteed the rights to life, liberty, property, due process\n\nNot exactly. Life liberty and property cannot be infringed *without* due process. They can certainly be infringed.\n\n> Just because no one thought that putting penises into rectums should be included in that umbrella back then doesn't mean we're trapped now in 2003\n\nThere is a process to correct this, it's called a constitutional amendment.\n
Tightness and wetness are two different things. \n\n
On the Iran thing, that is a temporary thing, for certain countries with a high amount of terrorists, until we can make sure we're not letting terrorists in. I think that is completely reasonable, but perhaps you disagree.\n\nAs to valuable citizens, I'm all for letting them in. Through a process. Regardless of country of origin or race. But we can't continue to let millions of uneducated low-skilled workers pour in.
I'm very pleased with Lovie's first class. Currently #44 on 247 (I think the highest in 10 years), and all the way up at #34 on Scout.\n\nHoping with a full year cycle we can crack the top 25 next year.
Because it's an attempt to say that homosexuality is a completely acceptable condition on par with heterosexuality, rather than a genetic disorder.
I didn't propose denying them any rights.

None; never went to public school.
Uh, okay? Doesn't change what I said. Yes, the vaginas "loosens" when the girl is turned on, but different vaginas also have a different 'latent' looseness. \n\nA girl with a naturally tight vagina, who's not wet - you might not be able to cram it in\n\nA girl with a naturally tight vaginas, who's horny as hell - pure bliss\n\nA girl with a naturally loose vagina, who's not super wet - quite nice\n\nA girl with a naturally loose vaginas, who's super wet - she's probably gonna enjoy it, cuz I can barely feel anything at all, and will probably go for an hour

>  Arms back then meant manually loaded, gunpowder-triggered, single-ball muskets and pistols. \n\nNo, that's not what "arms" meant. That's what arms consisted of. Just as "press" consisted of newspapers (not the internet).
As to your first question, why would this person not be able to afford a $20 medication.\n\nAs to your second, that doesn't sound like natural selection to me (unless you think ability to make money is a genetic trait).
> Illegal Immigration hurts no one.\n\nThe workers who lost their jobs to immigrants would probably disagree. As would all workers whose wages have been suppressed by immigrant labor. As would people who've had crimes committed against them by immigrants.
It's really just smart business. Everybody knows Trump parents are more likely to buy books. 
My be you are, obviously no clue. But I find it very surprising that if you're fairly attractrive you get shit for rejecting chubby girls.
No doubt, never said you couldnt.
I respectfully disagree; I think it was a principled judicial stance. \n\nYes, he was personally opposed to homosexuality. No, that was not the reason he ruled in this case. \n\nAs spoken to elsewhere in this thread, a whole lot of perfectly constitutional laws would be terrible if imposed. Likewise, a whole lot of terrible laws are perfectly constitutional. \n\nHowever, in this country, we live by the rule of law (or at least try to). Ultimately that law is the Constitution. \n\nIn terms of originalism vs. "living document" theories, the whole problem for me is this - \n\nPeople living the living document theory because it happens to allow for expanded rights for certain things, or otherwise align with what they want. But that's because a majority of Justices agree with those ideas. \n\nLet's say things were to get really bad. Say Trump, or some future President, decided that America was a theocracy, and non-Christians could be shot on sight. Clearly against the Constitution. But, under the "living document" theory, if you got enough justices to buy in it would be kosher.\n\nScalia would certainly have found such things unconstitutional. 
Whether it's .014% of the budget or 14%, why should the federal government be funding a radio station.\n\nI'll concede that linking it to improving national security is silly, but here's the relevant part of the quote -\n\n> American taxpayers do not want their hard-earned dollars funding superfluous government programs just because that is the way things have always been done.
Yeah, education is expensive. But I posted elsewhere in this thread that, at least in my opinion, a better solution is addressing why it costs so much, rather than just saying "well the government will pay for it."\n\nAnd why is it so expensive? The government decided that students loans would not be dischargeable in bankruptcy, meaning lenders have zero reason to ever deny or even limit how much they'll loan out to students.\n\nThis increased the "supply" of potential tuition, and colleges responded over the last 40 years by steadily increasing tuition.
If you're just observing, and not a party, witness, etc., there is no "dress code." But out of respect I probably wouldn't were shorts, a wife beater, etc. \n\nDress like you're going to a decent restaurant. Nice jeans are totally fine.
> Work without compensation is slavery.\n\nWell no, *forced* work without compensation is slavery. An unpaid internship is not. And no where in my comment did I suggest businesses should be able to compel labor.\n\nBy your use of "exploitation" I can guess your ideology.\n\n> it wouldn't be long before workers were payed in company script and forced to live in company housing and buy from company stores\n\nAnd why would workers accept this? 
What 'low standards' do we have regarding ag products?
2012 was weird, five teams had a 5* but weren't in the top 25. Mizzou 32, Maryland 38, Pitt 42, Oregon St 44, and as you noted Ole Miss 47.
By your logic speeding is a worse crime than the Enron fraud case, or heck even simple burglary, since neither put people's lives at risk.
> Every single one of you who thinks we should deport them are guilty of crimes greater than 'illegal immigration.'\n\nAnd what crime is that?
Kind weird, but Cool Ranch Doritos. 
No doubt, but that doesn't mean the guy I responded to "can't afford it." Rather, it means he probably doesn't think it's worth it.\n\nWhich leads to another argument against "free" college - if grads can't even get jobs, why should the taxpayer be funding this?
Very interesting, thanks!
Abortions are legal in all 50 states
You forgot 12 ATHs
When I was in college, a fraternity brother of mine appeared in the male version, Guys Gone Wild. \n\nWe were down in Panama City Beach. He had wandered off, wasted obviously. Apparently GGW had a bus somewhere, and they had hired some attractive ladies to lure guys onto the bus. The bus wasn't marked or anything, in his drunken state he thought he'd just lucked out and found some hot chicks who were dtf and had a random party bus.\n\nSo they bring him inside, and he's thinking he's gonna get lucky. They continue to liquor him up, tease him, flash their boobs, etc. They then get him too beat off, with the girls just off screen. \n\nI assume they had him sign something, but he had no idea it was a GGW thing. Someone from the frat saw him in a late night ad. \n\nHe was pretty damn embarrassed when someone pointed out that gay men are likely the primary consumer of Guys Gone Wild. So who knows how many guys have beat off to a video of this guy beating off...
Because I don't even understand what it is.
Haha. Yeah that question was asked, but the Guys Gone Wild commercials were on normal channels back then. Just at like 5 am. 
> Because they can't afford it.\n\nThey could if the feds and state weren't siphoning off a large amount of tax revenue.\n\n> Programs like Sesame Street, Newshour, This American Life and Fresh Air.\n\nWho the hell even watches or listens to this stuff? Sorry, but we shouldn't be spending money on this crappie. Pay for your own PBS and NPR.
Well, no offense but I'd bet you're not that attractive. You're getting shit because you insist on going out of your league. I expect the girls that turn you down because you're bald are attractive.\n\nI've never heard of an attractive guy getting shit for turning down a chubby girl. Actually the reverse, he gets questioned on why he's "slumming."
> Even though we are a Court that was designed to check a prejudiced majority, my arbitrary philosophy compels me to do nothing.\n\nNo, the Constitution (in part) was intended to protect against tyranny of the majority, at least for certain issues. None of those issues being protection of homosexuality (or pretty much sexuality in general).
Yeah, we had 3 straight top 25 recruiting classes under Zook.
Wouldn't consumers flip out if their service provider did this?
>  Know that what this administration is doing sickens us, and does not reflect how we feel about you, at all. \n\nStrict immigration laws sicken you? 
Yeah, that's the problem
> 50% of rural stations would not exist without CPB funding\n\nHow do you know they wouldn't exist? Someone or something else could fund it, if they're in such high demand. Heck, the local government could, since you says it's in such demand surely the local residents would put up their own tax dollars.\n\n>  a huge positive impact across the country\n\nWhat is this huge positive impact? Some rural areas having a radio station? Frankly who cares. 
I said it wasn't illegal to discuss sanctions or other policies. That is quite different then -\n\n> with intent to influence the measures or conduct of any foreign government or of any officer or agent thereof, in relation to any disputes or controversies with the United States, or to defeat the measures of the United States
So it's a choice then?
> Unauthorized vs illegal immigration\n\nCompletely the same thing. The minute the visa expires they became an illegal immigrant.
While you make some fair points, I hardly find my tax bill to be "negligible."
Yeah, any thread in this sub with over around 50 comments usually means liberals have jumped in.\n
I decided to start making lunch a while back, rather then going out, and and stopped when I realized I wasn't saving much money. Like probably 3 bucks a day. Maybe I'm doing it wrong?
Not sure exactly what you're asking, but here's what I would do -\n\nSet a maximum amount for student loans which would not be dischargeable. And lower that limit every year, eventually getting to zero.\n\nMarket pressure would be forced to reduce tuition. Pretty simple.
Oh haha forgot. Live next door in Colorado, when my buddy from SLC visits he always loads up on real beer (which I believe is illegal to even bring into Utah?)
So some 3% of the population, which we need subsidize entertainment for? 
People like having access to a lot of things; it doesn't mean that the government should pay for it. And if people like it so much, why does it need government funding. Fund it locally.\n\nAdditionally, why is this a federal issue? If Colorado wants to ensure TV and radio access in rural areas, it can make some program.\n\nI was reading my local paper yesterday and became pretty frustrated. Front page article was talking about the school district begging for money from the state. Article a couple pages in talked about the state begging for money from the feds. \n\nLocally, we're sending money to Denver and hoping that the powers that be will let us have some of it back. On a state level, we're sending money to Washington and hoping that they'll let us have some of it back. 
Even if Trump directed Flynn to contact Russian officials, there is nothing inherently illegal with that. For either Trump or Flynn. It's just "bad form," according to anti-Trump folks, to have done so.\n\nIn terms of "obstruction of evidence," honestly not sure what you're referring to. Language barrier. We have the concept "obstruction of justice," which is lying to law enforcement, and "perjury," which is lying under sworn oath. Neither appear to have occurred hear. \n\nI also want to make something clear, which others on in this thread have alleged - there is no indication that Flynn contacted Russian officials *during* the election. While not necessarily illegal either, it would look must worse. The implication being that, perhaps not even explicitly, flynn promised something in exchange for the hacks and leaks.
And I said that where? 
Like I've said elsewhere, as my con law prof said, theres a lot of terrible laws the would be constitutional, and a lot of sensible laws that wouldnt.\n\nAt the end of the day it's up to the legislature. Like Thomas said. 
That's why I love bulleit bourbon. It has the highest eye content of any bourbon. Their barrel proof was amazing
Great bourbon should be enjoyed. Nightly. 
Must buy
Trump volunteer here. Let this be a state issue! Have the fed declassify it and step away. 
The President can be impeached, by a majority of Congress, for "high crimes and misdemeanors." Thus far there has been zero evidence that anything illegal has occurred. \n\nIf evidence comes out that Trump directed Russian hackers to target the DNC, then yeah ... that would be serious as hell.\n\nAre you referring to the whole Flynn thing? That's just a media blowup. Flynn was a private citizen at the time, and there is nothing illegal about a private citizen contacting a foreign government. Or contacting a foreign government to discuss sanctions or other policies. Or even having the President-elect direct someone to do the same. \n\nActually, what absolutely is illegal is the intelligence leak that Flynn had contact with Russia. It was discovered through a wire tap. It is illegal to wiretap US citizens without a warrant. If a US citizen is on a wire tap targeting a foreign government, their words must be redacted from any record, and there identity must not be disclosed.\n\nSo, someone in an intelligence agency broke federal law.  
Is there any evidence that homosexuals are more likely to help their nieces and nephews than heterosexuals? Honest question.
Where do you live where all beer is 3.2?
1. How much does ventolin cost? \n\n2. I don't really see what natural selection has to do with universal health care. \n\nThat being said, my response was pretty simplistic. Of course if someone doesn't support universal health care, at the end of the day it's about cost/taxes. Arguments regarding individual responsibility, etc., are just an expansion of that idea.
Every small business in America. Every business with a union.

Pay no attention to the lying media. Trump said during his ACCEPTANCE SPEECH that he would protect the rights and the people of the LBGT community - to the standing ovation of 10,000+ people.  \n\nYou have nothing to fear. 
Damn. Well if you all ever come to the bourbon capital of the world (my hometown) I'll show you all around!

The Top 10 reasons I am excited for a trump presidency are:\n\n1) As a proud father I want to leave the best country possible to my two children.\n\n2) My healthcare costs are greater than my home mortgage. I desperately needed Trump to win.\n\n3) As a small business person I expect my business to be booming with lower taxes and a better economy.\n\n4) I truly enjoy the comical tweets and how much Trump gets under the mainstream media skin. \n\n5) We have so much corruption and if Trump didn't win it would've only gotten even worse. I hope Hillary goes to jail.\n\n6) I cannot wait to see our new southern wall!\n\n7) I am extremely excited about our next eight years of prosperity!\n\n8) I love how Trump is filling up his cabinet positions with successful people, the kind of people we should all aspire to be.\n\n9) "Mad Dog" Mattis!!! Whooohooooo\n\n10) I look forward to staying in touch over the next 8 years with this amazing community we have all built together. \n\n
It turns out it was a two little black girls in her class. I explained to her when I picked her up that they just don't understand what is going on and I showed her pictures of the first family. \n\nI'm thankful it wasn't her teacher.

Did anyone else think that because of the thumbnail it was a Hans Solo coming out of that carbon hibernation?
I'm sorry you didn't see his ACCEPTANCE SPEECH, but he was genuine and to the roar of the crowd promised to protect the LGBT community. He recently just waved a LGBT flag! He's the first candidate to ever do that. \nHell he was going to gay weddings before Hillary changed her mind on the subject. \n\nLook if you or I ran against a bought and paid for media like Trump did we both would come out looking like the devil. I couldn't of handled all the fake claims and lies. I'm amazed he has.

It was a real pleasure meeting fellow bourbon fans. I look forward to the next bourbon meeting.
Well here in 🇳🇿 New Zealand they do just that. We have dined out nearly every meal here and it's a completely different dining experience versus the 🇺🇸. \n\nHere are my list of dining differences:\n\n1) It's more of a team effort. The servers serve the entire restaurant versus your specific table. This can be frustrating because nobody focuses on you as the customer. \n\n2) Restaurant owners want to save money so there are noticeably less servers than you would expect. This leads to long wait times for placing your order, nobody refills drinks - so you have to do that yourself by going to the bar, and absolutely everything takes 2 to 3 times longer than usual. \n\n3) The staff doesn't care. They don't need your tips (cause they don't exist). You feel like you are on their time and if they do anything for you - you can feel their disdain for you as the customer. If you are gluten free because of Celiac disease- they are really annoyed by you. You will sit down at a table and wait 10-15 minutes for a server to even visit your table for the first time - and they aren't happy about it. The customer does not come first here. \n\n4) You have to go to the bar to pay your tab at the end. You have to point out what table you were sitting at for the bartender to pull up your tab. Nobody would care or notice if you dined and dashed (I would never do that).\n\n5) Your meals are slightly more expensive, but because you don't tip it equals out to be the same. 
^^TelaTheSpy is an anti trump cuck trolling here on T_D. Look at his history\n\nOf course trump has the support of unions and small businesses - you are such an identity politic demohard - you missed where all the unions jumped ship to the Republican Party. 
Can we discuss how easily Godzilla would be taken down by modern weapons?? \n\nThe eyes and the mouth have no armor, so even if his scales could stop a tank shot - a sniper shot would blind him.

I just let her know that most Americans love Trump. 
I want!!
Great post 
Does that break a site rule?
I honestly can't say this about anyone else. She is so repulsive I can't even look at her face. 
I'm going to the event in Louisville. It was definitely a Charlie in the Chocolate factory moment for me. I was excited to find it and even more once I found the code to the party!
If you don't remember the past at all - the press worshipped every move he made for 8 years. He could of dropped bombs continuously for 8 years and the media would of still called him a saint - or gave him a nobel peace  prize. 
I listened to Alex Jones for the first time yesterday when he was interviewed by Joe rogan on his podcast. Wow the man is probably the most interesting man on earth. I thought he went off the deep end when he was asked about the meaning of life and he went off about humans transitioning, psychic vampires, and genetic evolution. I thought it was crazy. I turned to NPR next and they were interviewing a scientist who was saying the EXACT SAME THING AS ALEX JONES!! I'm now an Alex Jones mega fan. He is one in a billion.

I did it 30 times. All silver trophy
Fake news 
But it wasn't really mocking. It all started because trump said he remembered seeing scores of muslims on tv rooftops rejoicing after 9/11. The media attacked him for that. The reporter in question called him a liar and that he made it up. Well when video surfaced of news reports showing and talking about how muslims were doing what trump claimed the reporter in question denied knowing anything about it. He was telling the story of how the media lied repeatedly about him and when confronted they act like they don't know or remember. It wasn't mocking but story telling. 
That's what I was afraid of. What good is a +1 boost to their overall ranking - so instead of being a 92 it's a 93 but it doesn't affect any actual traits. 
CNN just ran a segment this morning showing Trump holding up the LGBT flag and tried to convince Mormons not to vote for him because of his liberal views.

How the hell did you do that?
Pretty sure you know what I meant, bud. But I'm not going to get into a grammar argument with you, have a good one. 
In the southern US, "boy" is definitely racist. It's historically a patronizing way to refer to black men of any age.
Title is highly misleading, please read the article.
Why not fight to have it tripled anyway? What do LGBT rights have to do with this?
Is that really necessary? To refer to someone as "It"?
Libraries serve an extremely valuable need of many communities, especially poor ones. If you don't have a lot of money you can get access to the Internet, books for leisure or education to further yourself, maybe some cheap coffee, a place to relax and/or hang out with your kids. Libraries are far from obsolete.
This site is utter garbage. I got four pop-up ads before I could even read the article. It's glaringly obvious that they are leaving out crucial details from the story. Also important is that only three fire trucks were ordered to remove a flag which they had only recently hung up. More than likely, it was a safety hazard.
Sorry, what do you mean?
So when you used the word "trannies", were you referring to the roughly 50% of transgender folks that experience sexual assault in their life times? Or the many tens of thousands of gay, lesbian and transgender people who were forced to hide who they are under DADA while they fought and died for your freedom to piss all over them?\n\nI ask you not to censor yourself, but to reconsider how you view certain groups of people. If you think they're confused, what have you done to help? If you think they're mentally ill, don't they deserve protection under the law just like everyone else?\n\nI'm not even talking about bathroom bills. I'm talking about "religious liberty" laws that make it perfectly legal to fire or deny housing and other civil rights to people specifically because of their gender identity or sexual orientation, while outlawing the same discrimination based on race, sex, etc. Do you think that's morally correct? If so, why?
I don't get it. Your silly shower fantasies aside, how does his name prove anything?
Read the article, title is a lie.
That's really cool, thanks!
Care to elaborate?
Great question! I was pointing out the absurdity of comparing LGBT rights to space exploration. Thanks for asking. 
Pretty unbelievable indeed, since no he didn't. Read the damn article.
Good, cause it's not true.
You know who else was an asshole? \nHitler. \nWhere was Hitler when trump was born? Did you see him? Do we have the body? I'm not saying trump is Hitler, just that no one talks about it. Why is the media not covering it? \n\n
This is a garbage story just like it was when it made the front page. We don't even see in the shot who or what he is looking at. 
Actually, I don't like the pledge because it's super creepy to pledge blind allegiance to a corrupt government and system. I will be loyal and pledge allegiance to those who have proven their worth, and our government falls way short of that. \nI also don't like "Under God" because I don't believe in God and many others don't as well. It only makes sense that I wouldn't say that part. \nPlease do not reduce such complex ideas to "hating patriotism".
Can you cite a source on them having killed Dunedain on the way to the Shire? I've never heard that.
The law makes perfect sense. Take your poison smog out of my public places.
This could have come from either side of the aisle. Aren't the alt-right literal neo nazis? 
So to clarify, /u/PeteGGarnstath doesn't think Christians should help people unless it's to convert them to Christianity? \nReally not trying to take your comment out of context. Feel free to correct me if I'm wrong. 
So we're fabricating outrage about something that you just speculate to exist?
Yeah. Sex is fun, dude. Whether you're Christian or atheist or liberal or conservative or whatever else, it's just fun. I want to have lots of safe, responsible, consensual sex, and don't really care if people think it's a sin or not.\nI'm not saying that Bernie Sanders should pay for my contraception, but it's silly to criticize people for wanting to have safe sex for fun.
wot
All this does is enforce the Gun Act of 1968 and allow them to take into account mental health issues. I don't trust Obama as far as I can throw him, but this title is basically just a lie.
...what? Is this really what constitutes journalism on /r/conservative?
Read the article, title is highly exaggerated.
Thing about that is, most women aren't going to vote for another woman just because of her gender. It may come across that way with Clinton, but more women than not are liberal and Democrat. \n\nRight or wrong, they don't perceive Republicans as representing their interest, regardless of race, gender or background. That's why democrats aren't flocking in droves to Ben Carson, Carly Fiorina or Ted Cruz.
Wait, what about 2008 was a slam dunk election? Whether you agree with it or not, McCain was in the same party as an extremely disliked president. Deserved or not, it would've been a huge uphill battle for any republican.  
NASA continues to be at the forefront of space exploration. SpaceX and others are great but currently aren't even close in scale. 
Ah, the slippery slope argument. Because doing what you want with your own body is the same as raping children.
It's hard to tell. The story may be true, but I don't trust anything from Gizmodo.
I'm confused, proppie. Do you think this is a good thing or a bad thing?
What the article doesn't mention is that a Texas man followed a (non-trans) woman into the LADIES' restroom to check her gender. To make sure that she was... female enough? Because she looked like she might be transgender.
Hi, thanks for asking. The article title is actually a lie. 
Where did you hear this?
Can you provide a source for this? A link? This is pretty clearly fabricated by a conservative group to make liberals look dumb. You can do better than that.
I don't understand. Doesn't everyone pay at least some in taxes? Even those that pay little or no federal income tax still pay state and local income taxes, and even if you get out of that there's no way to avoid sales taxes, whether you're employed or not.
Did you actually read the article? It mostly serves the purpose of pointing out that just because someone is attracted to kids doesn't mean they molest kids. Something I think is common sense.
No they weren't. The advertising board in the UK is considering a report on ads that enforce stereotypes about women. At no point does the video mention the report containing anything about fat women or attractive women, or banning anything at all.\n\nThis youtuber, Paul Joseph Watson, is highly inflammatory. He's the same guy that screamed about UK FLAG BEING BANNED just because one non-governmental organization was considering not celebrating a made-up patriotic holiday.\n\nCensorship is clearly a serious issue to be fought (except we can't mention homosexuality in kids' sex ed classes because family values or something), but inflammatory lies  only serve to hur the cause. This is the kind of doublespeak that Hillary would pull.
What a  loser. Just admit you talk shit to win votes. I can't vote for someone who cries like a baby when people lie about him, then tries to act like he has the best friends, everyone loves him, everyone loves him, amazing friends. The best people, he has the best people, yeah right.
Right. So let's continue that by fully funding nasa. Congress is currently starving them of funding. 
What the fuck kind of totalitarian madness is that?
Obama hasn't apologized and there is no indication that he will do so. 
What difference would it make? They would still have to pay you overtime if you work more than 40hours per week.
So they'll be getting a salary increase? That's a bad thing?
You must be pretty desperate if you have to resort to grammar policing.
Look at the source. Gizmodo has a reputation for inflammatory, exaggerated and just made-up news stories. I don't doubt that facebook is very liberal, but conservatives only shame themselves by associating with Gizmodo.\n\nEdit: It's like the National Enquirer. They might get it every once in awhile, but their information should be viewed very skeptically.
Yeah, where on Pottermore? This doesn't sound right.
Wasn't it just harry in the Shrieking Shack? Please correct me if not.
> trannies\n\nThat word seriously isn't banned yet? And before people start countering with arguments for free speech, there are plenty of censored slurs in this sub.
Conservatism is all about common sense, so let's inject some common sense into this discussion: Outlaw molesting children in restrooms. \n\nEdit: I just checked, still illegal.
Can you find a page for that? Guarantee you it didn't happen. 
Whether you agree with the policy or not, your appeal to grammar might not hold much water. Definitions are constantly changing and new words always come into existence to meet changing societal needs. "Texting" wasn't always a word either, to use one example.  
Is that what we're calling protests now? "Disruptions"? What does that even mean?
I wasn't expecting such a thorough response, thanks!
Haha so she's ugly for... wearing a hat. When it's cold. Got it. Also that third haircut is super cute. 
Actually there were massive protests, wheelchair-bound people crawling up Capitol Hill, chaining themselves to inaccessible buses, that sort of thing, to get it done. It wasn't just because the government decided to be nice.\n\nTo his credit, Daddy Bush signed the ADA (Americans with Disabilities Act)
Women, hispanics and black people will not flock to the Republican Party simply because of the VP pick, especially if they perceive that person as not representing their interests. See: Sarah Palin.\n\nThat's why Hispanics, black people and women stuck solidly with the Dems during this primary despite the Republicans having Cruz, Carson and Fiorina.\n\nOn the outside it appeared that many people voted for Obama just because he is black, but it's apparent that they wouldn't have done so were he conservative, for better or worse.
Thing about that is, you still need money to buy their shitty low-income option. If you don't have money you don't have money.\n\nFor the cafes, you need a laptop for that (and you're expected to buy something every time which may not be feasible). Not everyone can afford that.\n\nAs far as education goes I was talking about furthering your knowledge base. Something that books are great for.\n\nAlso, you mentioned e-books. Not everyone can afford a Kindle or an iPad or what have you. Libraries, unlike laptops, cafes, and home internet, are free.\n\nAnd before anyone starts railing on me, telling me that they need to pick themselves up by their bootstraps and get a job and stop being lazy: Obama wrecked the economy, remember? How do you expect people to get jobs without access to the internet? P\n
Hey, that's me! The AutoModerator actually deleted it automatically as soon as I posted it. So no censorship there fortunately. I'm sure I just accidentally broke some rule and got deleted. 
Obama hasn't apologized and there is no indication that he is going to do so. 
No he didn't. People will lambast Obama no matter what he said. He offered no apologies, and his worst instincts remark was clearly referring to the evil that started the war, not the nukes. It's karl rove-esque crap like this that is the reason no republican, despite having good ideas, has only one the presidential popular vote once since 1988.
Why don't gay guys have to prep for analysis?
Hi propshaft, global warming doesn't mean all the water goes away. 
How come?
What is she doing?
Atheist checking in! There is objective morality. You call it faith, we call it common sense. Either way, we both agree that murder et al is probably a bad idea.
Please read up on the issue. The title isn't actually a quote, and the situation is much more complex than you seem to think.
Could you elaborate on what you said about women seeing no man to marry, and that whole paragraph?
I don't feel the need to dignify your patronizing comment with a response. 
Yeah it would have been pretty outrageous if that was at all what he actually said. 
Oh, great! So /r/conservative is going to join the fight for increased NASA funding now? Because conservatives in congress are trying their darndest to stop the manned Mars mission so they could use your help 
Please explain to me how I'm wrong.\n
Yeah good thing that's not what he actually said. 
Ok. We don't want him because he's an Erdogan.
The "Tradition" mentioned in the title was literally students having to sing the Lord's Prayer for graduation.  That's pretty fucked up dude, no matter what religion you believe in.
So you stopped people on the street and harassed them?  Yeah I can't blame them bud. 
No, silly, I don't get it because your logic is flawed.
I'd like to hear more about this backdoor deal you think they have.
This is a very important point: Dumbledore almost certainly didn't intend to leave Harry as unprepared as he did. He planned on dying around the end of Book 6, but clearly didn't intend to die that night. He would have shown Harry how to destroy the Horcrux they found, and probably taught him more stuff.
He didn't apologize at all and the article title is highly misleading. Read the speech, it's not very long. 
Posting definitions isn't much of an argument. Boring.
Please take the time to read up on this, as this title is misleading and well, not true.
This guy is being upvoted for saying women only go to college to fuck men, and that they're too stupid to have a real career.
This is not anywhere near an actual quote. The actual situation is (as usual) much more complex than is being portrayed by the media. Please read up on this.
Source?
Please read the speech. That's not what he said. He said that the war itself, particularly the imperialist/racist/ genocidal causes of it, rose de humanity's worst instincts. The title is totally misrepresentative of what he said. 
I'd rather get screwed for 47,501 than 45,000. I don't see how this law is a bad thing.
Hi /u/makemoneyb0ss, thanks for asking. I was saying that forcing people to stand during the National Anthem is totalitarian.
Funny thing about this. In my part of the country at least, Target has always had gender-neutral fitting areas (and so do every other store I've ever been to, so it's not just Target). Seeing as this happened in a dressing area and not a bathroom, this would have happened even before Target changed their bathroom policy.
This title doesn't mention that students were being made to sing The Lord's Prayer for graduation. How is that "tradition" ok?
Obama hasn't apologized and there is no indication that he plans to do so. Why are people always screaming and moaning about this? There's plenty other stuff to criticise him for. 
Just like it's subjective to say one religion is better than the other? 
Wait, where does it say he wanted her to go to Bulgaria with him?
Funny enough, California votes count are just as important as all the other votes. Especially considering that ~10% of the population lives there.
I don't understand.  What about being gay or transgender makes them degenerate losers?
Sorry, you said something about "trannies". What group of people, specifically, were you referring to when you said that?
Walking dead episode takes place in an old aquarium. A giant stuffed great white shark hangs from the ceiling in the foyer. A character jumps over the rail of the 2nd floor balcony over the shark to escape some walkers and land on something soft.
MRGA!? Mrgrlrlrlrlrl! Murlocs for Trump?
The league wouldn't let him wear a suit and tie on the sideline a long time ago, so he said screw 'em.
I got my pitchfork ready! ...wait, he was polite?! I better find the receipt for this thing.

Far Cry 4. When the bad guy with a lot of guns tells me to wait at the table, I wait at the table.\n\n15 minutes later I leave the ashes at the shrine, and the game ends.
Trump is a private citizen who was not voted in and swore an oath to serve the public trust. This alone makes any corruption Hillary commits worse. She was elected by her peers to represent their interests.
Well we went with 3 helicarriers that can read your DNA from the sky. They use an algorithm based on all your online habits and records to determine if you're a terrorist or not before killing you from miles away.\n\nUnfortunately they crashed and we don't have enough money left to try something else.
Logged into a MUD I used to play back in the late 90s to see if it still existed. I killed a fawn (baby deer), skinned its pelt and carved it up for food to get some HPs's back. I got http://powerlisting.wikia.com/wiki/Simian_Physiology.\n\nBaby deer are really cute though, I think we can make up and be friends. 5/10 we become friends or go our seperate ways.
Are there any feats for geodude like there are for other Pokemon? Some Pokemon have crazy ridiculous feats like flying supersonic or 3000 IQ.\n\nRound 1: If it only weighs 45 lbs. I'm going to say he can't beat large, strong animals. Even made of dense stone, 45 lbs. isn't going to break the bones of anything like a gorilla or elephant (both of which will pick the geodude up and fling it around casually). \n\nImagine a 45 lb. person with a short pee wee league baseball bat made of stone hitting something like an elephant in the leg as hard as it can; you are just going to make it angry. There's simply not enough weight behind the strikes.\n\nStill, it will likely go 5/10 because it's a rock, and they are still animals. Against a tiger, grizzly/polar bear, rhino, elephant, or gorilla, the animals could get lucky and smash geodude against something to cause major damage, or they could exhaust themselves attacking him. Geodude could get tired too though, so it's pretty even.\n\nRound 2: it depends on how crazy his abilities get. I didn't play much Pokemon and it's been a long time since I watched the cartoon, but geodude would have a definite edge.
Wake up in the morning and go about my day. Nothing that happens in politics is going to affect me as much as my own personal choices. (I've already lowered my expectations this year so it'll be easier to deal with!)
Same thing is happening in the US too. It shouldn't be hard to beat Trump, but the Left continually shoots itself in the foot with tactics that only make it hard on themselves. Every time I see a liberal just blanket label a Republican or Trump supporters racist, ignorant, bigots, etc. I just think to myself, "Yeah that'll get them to change their mind!" Start listening. Respect and try to understand their point of view before you jump to conclusions.
Not on the list, but Rand Paul. (Wouldn't happen, but it would be the best choice IMO).
Wow. Nice.\n\nRound 1: eventually. This is probably the toughest.\n\nRound 2: Ninja Gaiden 2 is actually a lot easier than 1.\n\nRound 3: I actually beat Abadox when I was a kid, but I couldn't beat Ninja Gaiden 1.\n\nIt takes him about 12 hours to beat ninja Gaiden 1. Between his reflexes and intelligence, he will figure out the cheesy patterns and rarely fall for the same trick twice, where the game spawns bats to knock you into pits in the middle of jumping etc.\n\nMoving onto 2 is a lot easier, especially since 1 is very familiar. 6 hours.\n\nAbadox is different as a shooter, but Batman has the guts to battle in the belly of the beast! 6 hours.
I'd rather we moved on so KC would get Houston, and we would go to NE. \n\nI don't mean to offend any Texans fans but I think we would put up a better fight as a divisional rival. Houston in NE is pretty close to giving NE 2 bye weeks.
I don't think these groups can grow on their own no matter how professional and reasonable they try to appear. Their growth is based on external factors outside of their control that push people in their direction. For the US, Flat wage increases for 2-3 decades, concepts such as white privilege, shrinking job market, negative labels such as racist/nationalist, and the feeling of generally being written off and forgotten will cause people to seek acceptance and understanding just about anywhere. New members will not understand the history of the organization they joined ("they're not like that anymore!"), and because everyone within is so nice and understanding of their plight, everyone from the outside is a hater, and they don't really have anywhere else to turn to even if they did leave.
Actually, we could. U.S Military doctrine is to win-hold-win. Our budget and strategy is designed to fight a two front war (basically wars in the pacific and atlantic). We hold the line on one front while winning the other, then win the 2nd front. It used to be win-win, but this was drawn down sometime after the turn of the century. Again, this is fighting a war, not occupation (which I edited that I misread the scenario). 
What if they eat humans, and there's a political group called Mammals for the Ethical Treatment of Humans (Meth)?
If everyone improves half an inch, that's 26.5 inches on a 53 man roster. That's a little over 2/3rd of a yard on every play.\n\nSo we can get down the field faster, but on offense we have to do it in 14 plays or less or else those extra half inches will make us overshoot the end zone.
I think that'd be awesome if you did. I have a 10 month old and another on the way, so I only play about 3 hours a week. Great way to have fun and plenty of friendly dialogue across factions.
Not all democrats are communists, but all communists are democrats.\n\n
There was actually a cannon, but they took it out because the dog is faster running across the ring instead.
Round 5: Honor Harrington with an Invictus class Superdreadnaught (Podlayer) would shred the covenant...as long as they can make more missiles.\n\nGetting hundreds of missiles (per salvo) traveling at .7c thrown at you from 75 million kilometers away against a fleet that isn't designed to defend against missile spam is going to be very very bad( laser head missiles only have to detonate within 50,000 km of their target to score hits, as well).\n\nIf they tore the SD(P) apart and used the technology alone, the range of missile doctrine offense/defense of the Honorverse at even a lesser scale would still be disastrous for the covenant.
People don't want to admit that their 1st world comforts come (partially) from 3rd world hardships.
It's amazing that all Trump has to do at this point is be better than Hillary, and he can't seem to do it. Even Russia is throwing him help: "We don't want President Clinton. Here's their leaked strategy against you." Trump: "I'm not changing."\n\n
United Federation of Planets. Federal Republic in a post-scarcity environment. Hopefully we can skip the WW3 part where 700 million people died.\n\n...I concede most forms of government would work in a post-scarcity environment, though.\n\nEdit: An open AI type governance is a big one for me. It would need a lot of checks though: no internet access, you insert data via remote storage, then throw that storage device in the incinerator once the transfer is complete (To contain the AI). It would also require transparency of what data is being given it because the system will fall apart if the AI starts saying things like "tax cuts for the rich, and build a wall." People will also have to keep a healthy skepticism and not foster a culture of unquestionable AI worship. 
Our fans are always dressing up as stadium seats at home games. Makes it look like it's partially empty all the time.\n\nEdit: can't see my own flair on mobile I guess? Talking about Miami.
Hey remember that time when the U.S. Invaded Iraq and Afghanistan and had no problems getting rid of insurgents?\n\nBombs and missiles are worthless when your enemy is hiding among a civilian population. Also, American soldiers are just as likely to defect rather than shoot other Americans since most of them are pro-gun.
If the players go off the rails, you can use the same prepped stuff and just change it around. Just use the Orc stats for human mercs, the castle ruin is a fort, etc. They don't know any different; this saved my butt multiple times.
Imagine if you're a soldier on patrol in a US city fighting a bunch of pro 2nd amendment people.\n\nYou're walking along and all of a sudden, some people start taking pot shots at you from windows in an apartment complex. By the time you get your bearings, several squad mates are wounded, and the shooting has stopped. You know that people live there; women, children, and elderly. So you can't bomb it or call for a tank because there's no point. \n\nSo backup arrives and you sweep through the apartment complex. You find 7 guns in 2 apartments; one was abandoned and the other one was owned by an old woman who passed away 6 months ago. The people living in the apartment didn't see anything because they were hiding in their homes when the shooting started. \n\nAre you going to round up everyone and put them in a camp? Maybe just all the adult men? Are you going to put up a checkpoint and inspect every vehicle coming into and out of a city? What about rebel sympathizers in the military who see a bunch of guns being smuggled in a car and they just say, "all clear. Move along."? Every day you are fighting the insurgency, the economy and the dollar is going down the drain, which means the govt has a lot more to lose trying to oppress its own people than the people have fighting tyranny.\n\nThere's about 340 million people in the US and there are no front lines anymore. Every rebel looks just like everyone else wearing every day clothing, walking around urban areas, which means they'll almost always strike first. The military can't be the military, they have to be a police force. 
Democrats: Stop shouting down different views because you believe you are right. We used to be the party that could counter arguments with logic and reason.

Not an expert by any means, but a lot in terms of military might, power projection, technology, and economics. There are plenty of factors but if you went down a checklist, the US marks off nearly every box for being a superpower, while China and Russia's lists combined probably wouldn't match it.

No, just like I don't expect Washington to magically warm up to him once he's elected. 
I haven't traveled abroad really, and I always wondered about this. There's a lot of talk from people that simultaneously favor multiculturalism and globalism, but I can't help but wonder how much the culture of more powerful markets affects emerging economies.\n\nMany big companies are owned by whites, the shareholders are majority white, the employees are majority white (middle and upper management at least), etc. Do you see non-white cultures in developing markets change even further as time progresses? (Wearing suit and ties, mannerisms, humor, demeanor, general business practices, etc.?)\n\nedit: I should clarify "white" being American or European in general.
That makes sense. "I thought these guys were hood wearing, cross burning Nazi skinheads, but they are well dressed and polite...just like me!"\n\nSo I agree with your original post in that presenting themselves in such a manner definitely helps recruiting new members into the fold, but I'm not sure if it will increase the volume of potential recruits in any meaningful way (compared to the external factors, anyway).
It doesn't have anything to do with the economy for a lot of Americans. As an American, when I hear that EU countries are subject to regulations by people that are appointed, not elected, I immediately lean towards Leave. Not committed mind you, but that's kind of the reason we revolted, no?

Honestly nobody should be upset at the Patriots/Belichick at this point. He's been clowning the vast majority of the league for over 15 years now. I'm more disappointed that there aren't many that can step up to the challenge at this point and elevate the game after all this time.
North America 10/10 in every scenario. The U.S. Military projects too much power and nobody else comes close.\n\nEven the 10 year pause isn't enough; current technology took decades to reach and other continents cannot just R&D their way in a decade to catch up.\n\n10 carrier fleets, 18 Ohio class nuclear submarines with ICBMs that can strike from 4000 km away (a sub can be off the coast of New York City and can hit anchorage, Alaska). The technological advantage is simply too great to overcome.
How many countries do you think would just surrender outright in order to hopefully come out on top in the end? \n\nFor example, nobody would blame Iceland for surrendering against the US military before a shot is even fired, and if other portions of the world are destroyed for resisting, Iceland will have kept its industrial/economic base intact. No matter how it plays out, surrendering is a win/win for some countries?
Honest question: Will Merkel (or any other non-UK pro-refugee/immigration politician) take heat for this? I haven't paid much attention to it, but I can't see this vote succeeding if asylum wasn't granted to so many people from the Middle East in the last couple of years.

If you throw all crime in there, yes. Illegal immigrants aren't in a position to commit fraud, embezzlement, or other white collar crimes. What's the crime rate if you count only violent crimes, such as murder, rape, assaults, theft, etc.? \n\nThe FBI has down 115,717 murders from 2003 to 2009. Illegal aliens commited 25,064 of them, or 21.6% even though they make up about ~4% of the population. \n\nIt should be noted that members of drug cartels along the Mexican border are illegal immigrants, so that definitely skews the numbers, but they are illegal aliens when they cross the border committing crimes, too.
Not as up to date and not as many. US is the only country to keep their nuclear delivery systems reasonably up to date.
Those lions were intimidated by the size of those guys' balls dragging across the ground.
Starting to look good for a more conservative friendly movement through Europe. A lot of countries are moving to the right after all the immigration. I think they're starting to figure out their social programs worked because so few of their population were content to sit around and collect a paycheck. It only took a couple of million refugees to realize it's not a perfect plan.
Don't forget Bain Capital. Buying out companies and leveraging their debt against them. Firing all the employees and re-hiring them with lower benefits. Dude butchered the livelihood of thousands of Americans to get rich. The only difference between him and Trump is that you would think Romney was a nice guy from meeting him, which is little solace for those who got hosed.
When Tony pulls his costume out of the closet, he looks at the goggles and asks "How do you see out of these things?" Peter replies that his senses are turned up to 11 and they help him focus. He's still in sensory overload and can't discern spidey sense from all the other stuff yet.
Do you think drones are effective in taking out rebels shooting at you from a school filled with children? Or an apartment filled with civilians? \n\nDrone strikes would just make the rebellion stronger as they kill civilians and destroy their homes and places of work.
Pseudo-intellectualism has given rise to anti-intellectualism. Too many people passing themselves off as educated and knowing all the facts, spouting out biased nonsense. \n\nWe're at this point because every time the news reports biased stories with an agenda, or someone posts an argument using only sources that fit their personal beliefs, people start to question the "experts." Add in cheerleading from their echo chambers, and it only reinforces that the other side is dumb.\n\nEach side is now conditioned to automatically believe anything their opponents say is wrong, that the data is flawed, the research was posted by a right/left wing thinktank, etc. There's no debate anymore; the other side is dumb, racist, ignorant, bigoted, and close-minded. They just don't get how right we are.\n\n\n\n
Hate to say it, but you can't even get people concerned about suspicions of our own election being rigged. 
I'm pretty sure the season ends after the 16th game. There are no games after that, of course. A 9 is really 6 turned upside down, so it must have been an accidental typo.

I want a Warhammer 40k AR game. Pick a faction (Imperium, Tyranids, Chaos, Eldar, Dark Eldar, Tau, Necron, Orks), and go out and conquer. \n\nPokestops are planets you battle for to gather resources, and walking around lets you recruit more Imperial Guardsmen/Space Marines/Chapter Masters, and battle the enemy units to power up the ones you have.
The fact that they did not mention what is being discussed makes me skeptical. They're taking something that's a mundane fact (an incoming administration talking to an ambassador of another country) and leaving out the content of any conversations so peoples' fears and biases fill in the blanks.
Minorities are usually the ones that have to compete with illegal immigrants coming to this country for jobs. There are also some minorities who don't trust the Democrats anymore. To them, 50 years of voting Democrat has not improved the situation for many minorities living in the inner cities.

I agree with that. However, I would say that voting for a party you don't agree with in order to create a backlash later isn't what I would call an endorsement, nor would I call them members of that party.
I'm fine with strenghtening ties with Germany, but we should not neglect the UK because we don't like the result of their democracy in action. We have been allies with them for a long time, and there is no reason this result should diminish our efforts to keep that alliance strong.
Close some corporate tax loopholes and lower the overall corporate tax rate, giving small businesses a little more capital to expand or start up. Revenue is made up from closed loopholes. Infrastructure improvement projects to highways and internet. \n\nI think K-12 needs to be reformed, but I'm just not educated enough to offer an opinion worth a lick.

Not exactly what I meant. Poor analogy on my part. When there's a US vs. the world thread, someone usually mentions that someone like China has a billion people and there's no way the US could win. My counter to that was to ask how many infantrymen could shoot down an F-15.\n\nThe U.S. has a tech, numbers, and power projection advantage. The problem for a country like Russia or China with formidable air defense is that they cannot launch a counter-offensive. Their planes will not survive far outside of the air defense bubble. They cannot reach the U.S. homeland and its industrial base, so there is no way they can force the U.S. to keep a significant reserve in defense of the homeland. The U.S. knows this too, so they're just going to work on kicking the door down, even if it takes a while. One of the reasons an F-15 has never been shot down due to enemy action is because the US targets airfields. If there is no runway to take off or land, then the enemy planes aren't worth anything. In this kind of scenario, the US will throw cruise missiles, drones, marines, artillery, tanks, and anything else it can to wreck a runway.\n\nEventually the door is going to give; a few SAM sites here, an airfield is taken out. Another few SAM sites, a power plant becomes vulnerable, another few SAM sites, a train depot for a vital shipping route, etc. \n\nAnyway, this was all based on my flawed interpretation of the situation, so I just typed this out to clarify my reasoning and not leave you hanging.\n\nedit: I could be underestimating modern AA capabilities, but hey.
I'm hoping whoever takes over develops more characters that can be heroes in the future. The problem with the lore is that all the main heroes are the best at everything. Varian/Thrall is the best general on the battlefield, is the best Admiral when he steps on a ship, and is the best tactician when he's in the war room, etc. (when it comes to main events in game).\n\n
I'm not sure if they can evolve that far? A thicker carapace or being extremely quick is not going to change the outcome of getting hit by something like the Necrons' Gauss weaponry (undoes the atomic bonds, literally ripping apart the target's molecules), or a Dark matter weapon from a dark eldar.\n
Round 1: I get Rob Gronkowski's ability to party, I say clever quips whenever the player clicks on me RTS style. I name drop Kari Wuhrer. I can code a Warhammer 40k AR game, keep my 2 kids alive, rate outfits that people wear with a good sense of humor, and would also be the best salesman of Publix subs.\n\nI couldn't beat anyone beyond a normal human with those powers, but I'd make a hell of a lot of friends!
New Vegas led by Mr. House. A robot army doesn't need to be fed. There's no democracy or politics to interfere. A robot army feels no fear The citizens of New Vegas will not be drafted because the robots are doing the fighting. There is stability, food, water, reliable infrastructure, and an immortal genius to continue developing technology back to pre-war levels.\n\nNCR is bogged down by politics and long term war will be unfavorable.\n\nCaesar's legion is dependent on Caesar, who is already old, even if he is healed.\n\nBoS is simply too small and insular, like Sparta, which faded into history because their relations with outsiders cannot foster any sort of long term nation building, nor facilitate their own growth fast enough to become a threat.\n\nThe Enclave actually had the best chance, but since they are the bad guys they ended up on the wrong side of a few protagonists.\n\nThe institute is too small.\n\nIf the east coast brotherhood was still under a Lyons, I would have given them the best shot. Even though Lyons went against what the BoS stood for, it would have given them serious power in the end. The Capital Wasteland would have clean water and peace; after all the good the BoS had done, they would be trusted with the defense of the DC area. With trust comes recruits, information, and access to technology; these are necessary to build the foundation of a successful nation that is jointly ruled by a peoples' government in tandem with the BoS. In exchange for protection and R&D, the new government supplies food, ammo, recruits, and must surrender any recovered technology to the BoS (for a fair price in caps, of course). Elder Lyons' choices were not only moral, but also pragmatic. Of course, this would probably make a terrible plot for a game, which is why I like Elder Maxson being in charge in FO4.
Pharah can hold the main gate alone since the approach is a narrow walkway.

Biggest problem for most universes is the size. Sci-fi universes would need a lot of territory as a buffer, lots of industry, and not a lot of conflict (or pretty one-sided) to divide them while they handle the Tyranids.\n\nSo the Galactic Empire from Star Wars could do it, but smaller territory universes like Mass Effect, the Honorverse, or Halo(human or covenant...or both combined) couldn't do it.\n\nAs a curve ball choice, I pick the Demons of the Abyss from Pathfinder/D&D universe. Most mid level demons and higher can teleport at will. They dissolve into black tar, smoke, or explode when they die (leaving no biomass), and the mid tier and higher demons can drop some pretty nasty spells at will or 3 time a day. Lastly, they are as infinite as the layers of the abyss. They could actually outzerg the Tyranids and beat them at their own game.
I think it's because both young and old people want to do the right thing by others, but decades of life experience shapes and changes your perception of it.\n\nWhen you're young, you trust centralized power and vote for programs that will help as many people as possible, even if people have to make sacrifices to help those that need it most.\n\nWhen you get old, you've heard decades of the same old promises and have seen tax money you thought was going to a cause you believe in wasted or misappropriated to something else. You also realize you cannot save everyone; expanding welfare, health care, or immigration puts a strain on the system, and if the system breaks, everyone suffers. So you become more cautious, you pick and choose; preserving the system with little improvements along the way so some can be helped is better than risking things getting out of control and no longer being able to help anybody, including yourself.
He could, but it's a partially torn ACL. He's probably not much better than Moore scrambling around with an injury like that. Not really worth risking the rest of his career.

Clinton "serviced" donors? Clinton "rewarded" donors? Clinton "repaid" donors?
I don't think being proud of your team's stadium is necessarily trash talk, compared to putting down someone else's.
Edit 2: First edit is below but I think I need another. I read the scenario wrong; it is conquer, not war. I'm keeping my (mostly unedited) comment here to provide context for all the other posts. The first edit at the bottom is where my reassessment starts. Thanks.\n\nHow many soldiers with guns does it take to shoot down an F-15? There's your answer. It doesn't matter if China and/or the rest of the world has a billion soldiers; the U.S. will have air superiority and a power projection advantage the rest of the world can't compete with.\n\nWithout nukes, it's America 10/10. It would take decades to research and build up a fighting force to match up, but it's too late for that. You can't build ships without a shipyard. You can't build the shipyard without the steel. You can't get the steel without a supply line. You can't harvest the iron without a mining operation. All of that stuff will be on fire or turned to ash within the first week of the war starting. The U.S. will also target airfields; your planes can't take off if the runways are craters. AA sites will be whittled down. \n\nSince the U.S. Navy is bigger and more modern than all the other navies in the world combined, they just have to launch strikes and destroy infrastructure until everyone else decides to surrender. There would be a little land invasion by Marine Expeditionary Units etc, but it's not absolutely necessary except to guard the Canadian and Mexican borders.\n\nRussia and China do have Anti-satellite missiles. This will hurt the U.S. in terms of drone warfare, but there was article yesterday about the F-35 being able to act as a remote sensor platform in enemy territory, lasting targets for missile strikes from allied forces. Only the U.S. Has the stealth version of the F-35. (edit 2: Only the US having stealth capabilities is not true. I was mistaken)\n\nBonus round: America 7/10. The U.S. Nuclear arsenal is not as big as Russia's, but it is more updated with better delivery systems than anyone else, which means more successful strikes on tactical targets. Then again, nobody really wins at the end of this scenario.\n\nedit: I realized I misread the scenario, as it calls for "Conquest," not "war." In that case, the U.S. could take over and occupy maybe 40-50% by choosing countries that A) Feel they would be far better off being ruled by the U.S. (e.g. 3rd world countries with despotic or corrupt governments), or B) Countries that would temporarily accept it in order to preserve some sort of status quo. (e.g. Countries like Germany or Switzerland, where if they're allowed to prosper and conduct business as usual, they'll bide their time until resistance is preferable to the current situation).
That's a huge impact though. If there's 5 O-line and 4 D-line, he creates a 1v1 matchup for the other 3 guys on the D-line. Having interior D-linemen that require 2+ blockers creates lots of opportunity for the rest of the team.

I grew up in south Florida. Lots of people go night fishing for several reasons. For my aunt and uncle it was because the marina was a madhouse and they hated dealing with  boaters drinking and arguing about using the boat ramps, parking, etc. Other times it's to avoid exposure to the sun, and if you drive away from the coast far enough, the sky without any light pollution is pretty sweet. Lastly, a lot of fish and squid come up from the depths at night, especially a few bioluminescent creatures.

WILL LIBERAL JOURNALISTS DISAVOW??!!!!!
Bannon's anti-Semitism led him to do this...don't you all see that??
This journalist was supposed to have been an angry Trump supporter driven to spite Moslems by the President. Instead of claiming inspiration for this bombing on the election, the man of color blames an unnamed 'white girl.' Maybe this anonymous Caucasian chick is the link to the Russian/Trump industrial complex we have been waiting for. Media need desperately to dig down to the rotten bottom of this twisted tale of leftist subterfuge and sabotage.
I thought making up sources got you promoted in the MSM. \n The New Turks just found their newest reporter!
If you are black and falsely accuse a 'white girl' of committing a crime, is it racism?  \n\n

> Jindal could also have very well won the presidency\n\n\nIDK about that(superficial things like height play a huge part in the presidency), but I would've felt a lot better supporting him than supporting Romney.\n\nStill liked Romeny, and hated what the media made him out to be, but thats expected. I'm really happy that Carson started counter punching at the press conference this weekend. That was great. \n\nThe thing I hate about this cycle is how bad the candidates have started squabbling with each other. It reminds me of what Ace said about how the debates seemed like that scene in the Dark Knight where the joker breaks a pool stick and makes the goons fight to death

The thing I'm worried about is that he still has high negatives with the general public, but he had really high negatives in the Republican party before he ran for president and he completely turned those numbers around. It don't know if he can pull it off with the general public, but I'm not going to underestimate a man with his skill set. \n\nStill disappointed about Iowa, but coming in second with no ground game is a pretty big feat.

They can be both? 
The reason they have that system is to avoid candidates like Sanders. Maybe in four or eight years, a ~~communist~~ ~~socialist~~ democratic-socialist-that-is-also-an-Eisenhower-republican-and-don't-you-forget-it might be more tenable to anything outside of Bernie's super white fan club.

What, in your opinion, would need to happen to get islam reformed? and what type of attitude and conditions would the west need to have to get it reformed?
> Its almost as if they want to be marginalized so they feel more unique and special ~~in being gay.~~\n\nThat's all of the left. Bill Maher recently interviewed Obama and complained to him that he wasn't respecting atheists enough, because atheists were a minority, so they deserved special treatment, **but if you break down every demographic into special segments, every group is a minority**. Game theory says constantly doing this is just going to constantly ossify other groups. 
I never watched Samantha Bee's, Seth Meyer's, or Colbert's late night talk show's live, but I decided to do it after the election. Massive levels of schadenfreude.

So was Trump in 12, but as a public figure. Every single republican has supported increased immigration in the past, but you pick the one who you think will at least crack down on illegal immigration.
No, they aren't. America was the only industrial power after WW2 and we could afford unions without the global competition. \n\n*Edit contraction
No he won't. His legacy definitely will be protected and everything that was wrong with his presidency will be blamed on Bush. The idea that most historians won't protect him is insane. Non-politically active people will only know him and his presidency as FIRST BLACK PRESIDENT OMG OMG OMG GREAT SPEAKER OMG SO INSPIRING. none of his divisive rhetoric will come out
It's dumb, but this stuff does make a difference. Even though, as the posters below noted, Clinton beats Sanders in spades if it's about measuring Hollywood support. 
>He's a failure because he didn't liquidate his entire wealth and put it into a completely arbitrary market\n\nNo one would call Steve Jobs a failure because he didn't liquidate Apple in the 80's and then put all of it into the stock market, but people swallow this once it's directed at Trump.\n\nThere's perfectly valid reasons to not like Trump(his bombastic personality and him dancing on several issues), but this one is completely asinine. 
He disagrees with Pence about other things though. He disagrees with him about NAFTA, the Iraq war, and both of them have massive disagreements on engagements in the middle east. He said Kim Davis should respect the law, he's waived LGBT flags at his rallies, said transexuals should use whatever bathrooms, and the world's second richest gay man has been a big public supporter of his. \n\nI get why people might think Pence being VP equals curtailing of LGBT rights, but based on what we know of Trump's other statements, I don't get the panic over it.

[Full quote](https://www.thecatholicthing.org/2016/01/29/chesterton-on-progressives-and-conservatives/) adds some context. More accurate phrasing would be, "The business of conservatives is to prevent *those* mistakes from being corrected. \n\n
Do you think Trump becoming the nominee can at least have some benefit to the conservative movement?

Newscorp, home of foxnews, [donated](http://www.opensecrets.org/orgs/recips.php?cycle=2016&id=D000000227) a lot more money to her than they did Trump. \n\nClinton also openly stated that she would never take on Wall Street and instead devote her time to stopping racism. As long as the left focuses on identity politics, what you would call the oligarch class is perfectly happy to support them.

This is goofy, he was persecuted because he perjured himself in court. I doubt Erickson would be writing this piece of newt was the nominee.\n\nErikson also didn't care when bush blew up the budget while Clinton kept it relatively stable.\n\nThe one thing I'm happy about Trump for doing is exposing how hollow a lot of these guys are
Don't Trump, Carson, and Cruz(he wants to arm the Kurds instead) all support this as well?

Don't sweat it too much. The default for every culture is liberal, and young people buy into cultural movements more than older people. As for good websites/people to follow, I've always been a huge fan of wunderkind Ben Shapiro who runs [dailywire.com](http://www.dailywire.com/) and was in the same position as you, except at Harvard Law. \n[Ace](http://ace.mu.nu/) is also a pretty decent blog to follow from time-to-time.\n\n[Tyler Cowen](http://marginalrevolution.com/) is decent for economics, but doesn't really talk about culture that much.\n\n[Mark Steyn](http://www.steynonline.com/) is also worth a look at from time-to-time.
Paul's been terrific in the last two debates.\n\n\n*edit debates
It's a massive, massive gambit for him. A lot of the GOP base and donor class still have warm feelings for W. and still believe that the Iraq war wasn't a mistake. \n\nHe made a Machiavelli like play for the democrats anti-war base who still might not like Hillary Clinton. If he runs against her he could possibly take the union vote away from her and the anti-war vote, however he still needs to get 20% of the republican base that likes an aggressive foreign policy and more immigration to pay for social programs(the neocons) to show up and vote for him. \n\nIt's a huge gambit for him to take. 
I guess that makes sense. Hillary also has a likability problem as well, so in a match up against her it might be a wash, however the media will be completely in the tank for her.\n\nRubio might be the only likable candidate with media savvy in the entire race. The thing I worry about a Rubio nomination is that a large segment of his base doesn't trust him over one of the most important issues(immigration). That could turn around to bite him(if he even gets the nom., he's been stagnant at 9-10% for a month or so now.) 
It's for two reasons. The first if that reddit is to the left of Bernie, so every conservative interested in politics has already seen left-wing talking points.....everywhere but niche or right-wing subs. The other is that a lot of conservatives on r/conservative didn't support Donald Trump and still have an If-by-whiskey approach to him. Going to /pol/ would give you a much different view of right-wing dialogue. 
Is there evidence that Trump brings a coalition of voters that wouldn't vote for the GOP otherwise? Because his poll numbers seem to be a lot more static than any of the other candidates^1. I also don't know if the diluted field helps or hurts Trump. Likely GOP voters split hard towards Carson against Trump in a head-to-head, but every poll about the economy and national defense have voters trusting Trump over every other republican candidate. \n\nDo the users of /r/conservative actually trust Trump to pull in enough votes in the general? \n\n^1 At least among the top candidates.  
Just learning from [Obama!](http://www.politico.com/story/2009/01/obama-to-gop-i-won-017862) Hopefully this divided nation can heal after a tough and viscous election cycle!
He's clearly been 100% accurate about everything this millennium. Whether its been the Iraq War, the lebanon war in 06, the syrian surge that worked out great in 11, or the downfall of Trump, he clearly has a finger on the pulse of what americans want at the moment. This will prove to be a smashing success as well  
Scott Adams has a [decent piece](http://blog.dilbert.com/post/152998516891/the-de-hitlerization-of-your-brain) on his blog about it
In some ways it's always surprised me how well adjusted all of Trump's kids are. They had to go through 2 divorces when they where growing up + they where all born super rich to a well known billionaire(who didn't quite have the celebrity status he had in with the apprentice). Ivanka was actually in a [documentary](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8o46HH-TfNY) about super rich kids and she's the only one in it that came out well adjusted.  
>says migrants will help build caliphate\n\nI still don't understand what he meant by this. Maybe he's just suffering from Western racism. What is very clear though is that this has nothing to do with Islam, David Cameron, Barack Obama, George W Bush, and Tony Blair are all pious scholars of Islam and none of them would've lied to me about it
He's been right about 08 and 12, but this primary season he's been consistently wrong about almost everything on the republican side. \n\nTrump has been one of the slowest moving black swans in history
Donald Trump has entered the STOP POSTING phase of his candidacy. Shame because I actually liked his immigration stance(Cruz is similar) and his foreign policy stance(Rand Paul is similar)
[Godwin's Law](https://np.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/5xcqqt/this_is_my_great_grandmother_she_survived_the/dehks17/) ITT as well 
If just one Republican politician in the past had done this consistently and fought back against all the little things the media does(Shapiro has an excellent bit about calling out stephanapolos as a Clinton spokesperson), then Trump wouldn't be as popular.

I don't like the gov of russia, however fighting proxy wars in the middle east against a nuclear power should not be a top priority right now. \n\nYou don't have to like foreign leaders, but in this case, better the devil you know vs the one you don't seems wise. \n\n*Edit redundancy 
Something to that effect, yes
Why do they think Trump hates LGBT americans? Everything else she said is dumb, but okay, borders are racist and Trump's a bit of a braggadocios playboy, so he hates minorities and women, but where and why do they see some hatred for LGBT americans? Where are they getting this?
Let me rephrase that then; do you think Trump winning will at least show future candidates that they don't have to pander on everything?\n\nWhile Milo has associated himself with the alt-right, Coulter r'td a wn, and continues to get published in a web-magazine that considers itself alt-right. Milo's defended it, but Coulter's actually gone there\n\nCan you think of a realistic solution to reducing single-motherhood besides abortion? Since the left has a complete lock on the culture, I doubt any ground will be gained there, we are becoming less religious, so I don't think that the religion is the answer. \nMy value system places single-motherhood as a greater societal evil than abortion, if you believe that more single mothers is better than abortion than we are just at an impasse\n\n*Edit forgot to thank you for replying to me and doing this AMA. Thank you
> I mean, some of them quite literally are.\n\n\nlaws or prison camps?\n\n
I really hate how the media will lump in *illegal immigration* with legal immigrants. It'd be like constantly conflating shoplifters with shoppers and then saying putting cameras in place is anti-shopper. It really annoys me how the media will put that spin on it. 
Smerconish after it said he had heard that terminology as well. I wonder if they lurk.
Disappointing, if nothing happens we are back to square one anyway though, McConnell has folded to presidents before, but this is still something thats expected and disappointing.   
I still think Shapiro is a smart guy and I listen to his podcast, but it's clear he's past the denial stage and in the bargaining stage. Some Republican pollsters(Rick Wilson, Cheri Jacobs) are in the denial/anger stage.
I don't understand why a few policy differences is some major crisis. Biden and Obama had them, Gore distanced himself a bit from Clinton during 2000, HW was famous for calling Reagans economic plan, "voodoo economics", Nixon hated everyone, JFK and LBJ didn't get along, and Teddy Roosevelt formed a new party to run against his VP.\n\nVP and President disagreements are not a rarity.
>A Trump nomination is certain defeat. \n\nMaybe, maybe not. What you need to realize is that the media will relentlessly hound whatever candidate the GOP puts up. Trump also has the benefit of being the most charismatic person in the race.
> Lol sounds kind of fan-boyish now \n\n\nI'm the same way about Ben, listen to his podcast daily and usually try to watch all of his public appearances.  
Isn't his wife white?
Right, it's conservative pundits who threaten to leave earth if democracy doesn't turn out in their favor. Oh wait, it's old [Jonny boy](http://hollywoodlife.com/2015/09/21/jon-stewart-donald-trump-president-leave-earth/)
I hope I lose 20 pounds before I marry Jennifer Lawrence
I almost feels sorry for him. [Almost](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-41YQegGKU)\n\nAt this point anyone under 5% really needs to drop out. 
You can tell Ann doesn't like what Trump said at all, and if he where any other candidate she would be eviscerating him instead him(like how she attacked Ron Paul in 08 and 12), however she is okay with Trump shitting on something she vehemently defended for years, because the issues of immigration and demography are more important than whatever third world dictator does. \n
You mean to tell me, that if someone does something bad, there could be repercussions? Whoa! I never thought of that
and conservative pundits aren't?
nothing of value was lost
Ben Shapiro is pretty much my idea of a perfect conservative. Never seen him lose a debate or lose his cool
I kinda agree with this; republicans can't both be for more tax cuts and deficit hawks at the same time
I wish he did better as well, but two things are clear \n\n1.) He's not going to win.\n\n2.) We need him in the senate
> Cruz has several negatives \n\n\nLike what? Whats the dirt on cruz? I honestly haven't seen any besides his support for H1-B's,a and even then thats not full on amnesty
He could delete the preposition and I'd still agree with him
> Freedom of Religion is a constitutional right \n\n\nFor american citizens, which these people aren't
Syllogistic reasoning; intelligent people go to and graduate from college, ergo college educated people are intelligent. 
The fact that they actually believe any of that about Trump's social policies is nuts, but still really funny. \n\nThis is probably what parts of the left felt like when  certain segments of the right thought Obama was going to take away their guns and have a Chavez style dictatorship. \n
> Rubio ~~and Kasich are~~ is literally the only ~~two~~ candidate~~s~~\n\nKasich isn't a good debater, speaker, or politician. I don't know where you get the idea that he could mount a good campaign against Hillary. Rubio is a big if as well(I think he'd be great, in a manage-the-decline role) and I'd vote for him, but a large portion of republican voters don't trust him on immigration, which has become a huge issue. \n\nYou could make a decent argument that Trump is winnable(I've said before that he's the most charismatic person in the race and he easily destroyed a man with a 100 million dollar war-chest), but thats a very risky card to play.\n\n\n\n\n
> Rubio isn't an establishment Republican and was brushing over that he was in the Gang of Eight.\n\nWhat's fucking infuriating about the gang of 8 is that Rubio was the most eloquent proponent against amnesty when he was running for [senate](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yler4BEy9Ek) and then immediately turned it around and supported amnesty. Really infuriating. Trump's entire rise is due to immigration and the american people being constantly lied to by their elected officials about the topic. \n\n
> Mr Trump lost money investing in a casino.\n\nAnd Steve Jobs got outed as CEO of Apple, Howard Hughes was initially laughed out of Hollywood, Jeff Bezos has been named one of the worst bosses in america, Peter Thiel and his hedge fund lost hundreds of millions of dollars in a few years, Mark Cuban has gone to court over insider-trading, I don't know if Elon Musk's Telsa has ever turned a profit, WSJ was worth a billion dollars when Rupert Murdoch purchased it, now it's only worth 250 million. \n\nEntrepreneurs and businessmen fail all the time, and you know why I don't care about it as much as when politicians fail? Because it's their money, and it's their time and energy into these projects and they take the blame when they fail. \n\nPoliticians have a re-election rate in the US of 91%, because of this, politicians aren't tied or punished for their bad decisions
>“It’s 2015 and gay people can get married and we think that we’ve come so far, so, yay!” said Lawrence. \n\nIT'S THE CURRENT YEAR!!!
He is stumping himself
Still amazed that Christie or Jindal didn't run in 12. At the time both of them could've taken it, now they are embarrassing themselves at a second rate debate. \n\n
To liberals, LGBT people and muslims are marginalized in the US, so none of their views can be bad and you can't criticize their views otherwise, that would be "punching down". However, Christians(especially white Christians) disenfranchised a lot of people with their power in the US, so they need to be knocked down a peg or two. It's the best way to achieve equality. 
>Im saying we dont have the ability to deport 12 million undocumented people, cause we dont know who they are.\n\nSo, we can deport them as soon as we know who they are? Putting things like e-verify for employment would be a start and getting citizens to report illegal immigrants would also be a start.\n\nNow, let me ask you something, is illegal immigration a problem or not?
> the low education inner city Dem voters.\n\nAKA, the majority of democrats. Most of america isn't college educated, both of the parties majorities are non-college educated. 
Both sides play this game though. The left calls Eisenhower, with his support of public sector unions, the last moderate Republican
rageposting always cracked me up
two of those, Intelligence and morals, are too capricious person to person to mean anything. as for Education, [well](http://www.pleeps.org/2016/11/14/would-clinton-have-defeated-trump-in-an-epistocracy/)
We'll see what happens, did you think Obama would be an agent of change in regards to campaigning financing and money in politics? Did you think Clinton would be? \n\nI'm not asking to gloat or to be nihilistic about how "nothing changes ever, it doesn't matter anyway, so activism about it is dumb", but what politicians would you actually trust for reform on this issue? \n\nI somewhat share your trepidation about Trump enacting change, but besides maybe Rand or Cruz, he seemed like the strongest bet from the right to put policies in motion that would stop it. \n\nEven if he didn't touch Citizens United, but put term limits in and instituted his proposed policies on lobbying, would that be a good baby step towards stopping some corruption? Would you be okay with trying to stop it piecemeal?\n\n*edit spelling/syntax
Clinton wasn't Bush/Obama level bad, but IDK if I'd call him good. \nH.W. was a good "game manager" and backed off in Iraq, but never did anything exceptional.\nReagan was okay, but gave us amnesty and started the era of massive debt spending. Carter-no, Ford-no, Nixon did nothing right, LBJ was a mess, Kennedy made made a few good speeches, might've prevented a nuclear war with russia, but the bay of pigs disaster was his fault. \n\nEisenhower was pretty good, but america had the world's manufacturing base, so it'd be hard for anyone to fuck that up. \n\nIDK, maybe Coolidge is the ideal if all things are equal, but they aren't. \n\nReagan-H.W.-Clinton are all a lot more preferable to the last two.
>  if ~~and when~~ he goes down.\n\nAtm, I'm in the Cruz camp, but, "Trump is going down any minute" has been repeated ad nauseam for half a year at this point.
> She'd be near the top of my reading list if I ever cared to read some feminist philosophy\n\n\nShe's a good author outside of that as well. Her *Glittering Images* book was a great primer on art history for the layman(me). Definitely worth a read if you're interested in that field. 
Anyone else almost feel sorry for how deluded these people are? Trump was the most socially liberal candidate in the republican field, it was just his tone and his nationalist streak(which isn't racist, every good leader should want their country to be successful) that makes them freak out. 
Mexico deports illegals, China cracks down on illegal immigration, and Israel crack down on illegal immigration. Are you really saying the US can't/shouldn't emulate their strategies?
I don't understand why we can't just emulate the countries I already listed and copy their solution when it comes to this problem. If you don't like deport and wall, what is a better solution?

Everyone besides Scott Adams and Ann Coulter, both of them predicted a Trump presidency last summer.
Why are you connecting the two? 
So you want the VP to be a lapdog?
This honestly isn't the worst thing ever. I was on the debate team in highschool and college and did repeat a few points. It's not that uncommon, but it definitely doesn't look good
>1) How has the last 8 years negatively affected YOU personally that you would vote for him? It's been pretty good to me, so I'm honestly curious as I probably live in a bubble.\n\nMy health insurance premiums went up, but thats about it. Oh, I was able to sell a lot of .22 ammo. \n\n >2) If it were Bernie instead of Hilary, would you have voted for Bernie? Why or why not?\n\nI liked a few of the things Bernie said. I would've preferred Bernie v Trump\n\n >3) How do you discern Trump's true intentions from his words? He's contradicted himself throughout campaigns that make me unsure what he actually stands for on specific issues.\n\nWait and see. Obviously I wouldn't have voted for him if I didn't think he would execute a few of his policies, but I'm not going to pretend he's been faithful to his word throughout his career ["The media took Trump literally, but not seriously, his supporters take him seriously, but not literally"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ob-LJqPQEJ4&t=1561s)
I think Bannon got it right.  The media is the opposition.  
This is fucking laughable.  This is like having like having Dr. Goebbels cover the jewish community in Berlin.  Any guesses as to how her kid is going to report on the DOJ?  Anyone who watches cnn is a complete moron.
Please don't. I really want Africa to turn into a better place, but it seems like they're stuck on bad ideals.
would obama have accepted any white christian refugees from this?
i dunno man.. that time they said it was illegal to read wikileaks.. i feel like thats almost been forgotten about. i cant understand how they continue to be a profitable business
hes a muslim now?
cory is a dumb asshole
blame everyone else. let your racism show. very cool.
goddamnit i love sbarro
lolz racist dictator war criminal
does this loser really want to talk about crime stats by race? has anyone seen the whitemale on black female numbers? and lets not forget to add in prison rape!
im still amazed by wireless bluetooth HQ audio
yea i dont wanna tease the disease. 12 was my pre-game. thanks!
i want this guy and trey gowdy in charge of everything
who could have guessed it was black people? holy macaroni i didnt see that coming. is anyone else shocked by this? do blacks do that a lot? 
amnesty is for terrorists ONLY. not potential republican voters
oh yea man, booze companies are the biggest liars ever. i still havent seen a jim beam ad featuring my old piss-soaked matress, or me crying in the back of a cop car. is it wrong that i kinda prefer people around me in a social setting to have a drink or two? because i think i do.. maybe its cuz i kinda feel like i have a stick up my butt not drinking and i need them to compensate? 
what exactly is this supposed to do? i dont understand why this is being done
i cant wait to post my year pic\n
jungle savages is on wrong spot
so ill be able to download them to both consoles? (the ones that are combatible anyways?)
because "rape culture" was supposed to go along with the narrative of how evil white men are. it was supposed to refer to an imaginary world where white college football players were committing lots of rape and getting away with it, but as it turns out most of the rapes everywhere are not committed by whites. And upon figuring out that islam is pretty much built upon rape and child rape, they have to drop the term "rape culture", lest someone start correctly referring to  islam as "rape society".  TL:DR - narrative refuted by facts
dont be racist against mexicans VS requiring voter ID is da raycism
what was the actual picture of?
i think its the oldest damn model there is, so youre probably right as rain. the good news is i have a gift card to use and im due for a new console.
oh for gods sake just look up Liberia.
(question)
best part is thats not even a photo of the actual execution - its actually just the (stock photo of muslims publicly executing a young boy) i really wanted to capitalize that but i hate when people type in all caps
isnt this for russian tanks only?\n
yea i saw that last night also. all the sudden 5 or 6 subreddits had the same headline up at the same time, all with 8-20k upvotes. thats like the meme of the kid winning the internet
blacks invented raping a baby to cure aids.
haha yea! "youve been hiding this vodka the whole time?!?" "uh no we just forgot about because none of us drank for a few months"
ha ha no i dont play all 65, but i save all the free ones from xbox live gold.. i think ive only gotten rid of some dirtbike racing game because who gives a shit 
try darksiders 2. i put if off forever cuz it looked generic and boring, but its not. its the same action rpg style combat as fable, but with pretty much a D3 loot system and 2 skill trees. it turns into mostly puzzle solving with boss fights mixed in. it gets boring towards the end but it was like 5 bucks. not a brilliant game, but pretty nice.
that was actually most of my questions! thanks! so thats pretty much what you do in this game? grind up and get better gear? 
can you do any small projects or anything around the house to give you a small sense of accomplishment? even like doing a puzzle? it dosent have to be a huge project. stuff like that helps me. even like spraying some wd-40 in that damn door thats been squeaking for years.. changing that damn lightbulb in the fridge thats been burnt out for months..
she really is utterly unfuckable
midterms! stay active! when the losers move on to the next outrage du jour, we go out and vote again!
do one about blacks
HAHAA AHAHA oh man!
what a cunt
i have a 360 with a 500g hard drive. so far i have apx. 65 games on there. im getting an xbox one soon. what happens when i have some games on my 360 that arent playable on xboxone? will i have to be swapping consoles out between games? isnt my "liscence" only usable on one console at a time? 
lolz fuck detroit
ok i just started a new game and it seems to be working. thank you!
lol cocaine
youre probly right! ill try that after work in a few hours. thats a great idea. thanks!
lol blacks dont talk to they keeeyids
i sometimes bartend at situations wheres its an open bar, meaning everything is free. its been almost 6 months and i have yet to see anyone behave how i would have around free idiot juice. people even ask for "no favors" sometimes, meaning they dont even want a full measure of booze in the drink. crazy, right?
what do you mean by admin jobs? thanks for the reply\n
i didnt see any women or children
(question)\n\n
well i know the person is a drunk and i allways see their car at bars as im leaving work. theres an 85% chance the person will be over the limit. (i know this person and how they drink)... but what happens if they get pulled over a few times and pass a field sobriety test.. would they start looking into the tipster (me) for reporting false info?
its a community college, and i think they only offer a few 4 year programs, but with good grades most people transfer to the local state school for years 3&4. so youre sayin you make 65k without really busting your ass to find the best possible job?
i dont think we have seen an actual protest in years, other than parts of that silly womans march. under obama, riots were encouraged and called protests. these are full fledged riots. i think social media adds to the mental state of these losers. "i have 14thousand online friends! im important!"
the overlook?
thank god for donald trump.
ok.. thats telling me my next quest for petra is #5_ kell rising. that takes place on winters lair, which is apparently locked because i dont own the dlc. i have lots of very basic questions about this game..
sweden clearly just copied their rape culture from white males. this is why white males shouldnt be allowed to speak and spread their hatespeach
oh dear god i hope he can do it
i think so too. but its funny to imagine it advertised like they do for some drugs.. isnt there some really silly pill that cures something dumb like drymouth, but gives you suicidal thoughts and anal leakage?... well it would be even worse than the commercial for that.
what a beautiful culture. so progressive
blacks never riot.  this headline do racism at me

soak em in the blue and use your polishing cloth
i can. i work at a place that just looks the other way when blacks are harrassing and racially threatening other people who work there
black people complaining when people dont tip? LOL
yea its kinda hard to do without looking like some kind of frat boy
i used to want to do drafting... now im signed up for mechanical engineering. am i making another huge mistake in life? again?
completeley awesome
nobody in school ever even told us that there were other mass killings committed by other people. it was about how racism from whites "caused hitler", which caused the nazis, which was that one time a bunch of people died. hitler wasnt even the worst of the bad guys back then by a longshot. just like they wont teach future kids how globalism almost destroyed the world.
i made more money at the filthy punk rock bar than i did in fine dining
well that doesnt matter, because if muslims do it it cant be wrong, ergo, rape is now feminism
wow. is this a real NYT headline? i defend their right to speak, but shouldnt this be prefaced with "opinion" or something? can someone point me to some articles about any propaganda laws or things like that? im curious to know where the legal line is between satire and propaganda and opinion and so on
Yeah. But if you check my history you'll see how many times I've had to raise. I guess people really don't like Aras. 
I'll trade you 2 CC1 4 CC3 for 2 keys.
oh yea bigtime. i have dreams where im smoking ciggs again too. i think its to be expected. it was a big part of you for a while. i also think its supposed to get you to try to focus on your subconcious and what it may be trying to tell you. ive been miserable for weeks and i think its because ive had my hours reduced at work, and i havent been working out due to an injury. my subconcious knows this and isnt happy, but it bubbles to the surface in anger. your gonna have to start paying attention to that very powerful part of your brain. but the good dreams are great! now that my brain isnt fighting off a literal poisoning every night, the dreams it produces are like an entire lord of the rings trilogy packed into a few hours
that is a brilliantly funny statement
skip the beer and get right to the good part! just go piss all over your bed a few times and then lay in it
this is exactly the answer i needed. thanks!
ok i looked thru my storage and cannot find the online pass. its still in my download history, but its giving me the option to "download again" if that matters.. im currently re-downloading the game and hoping that the online pass doesnt automaticaly come with it
another week another black mob attacking someone. the narrative is really wearing thing here, guys
same here. its kinda the only reason i want to buy an xbox one
aloha snackbar!
you found it! that means you wanted to. keep going!
internet traffic monetization is not something i understand, but i cant see how these shitty sites are even able to pay their staff. also i would implore each of the authors of these racist articles to get a part time job bartending at the local black nightclub, especially if they are white. thats a real eye opener, or "red-pilling" for any would-be black supremacist
go live with muslims
at least now there will be "violently removed clitoris" flavored cookies
b-b-b-b-but white people invented slavery and racism, all to build america.
i understand that, but what reason are they giving? to allow us the opportunity to see their lovely culture? how is this being sold? or is it?
do you call gang haterape terrorism?
thanks! it looks like i was doing a crummy job of understanding the nodes on the map. i found a copy for 5$ with no instructions and figured i should get it at the risk of some confusion 
wow. it doesnt list the inventor of medicinal infant rape.
LOLZ
the whistling should be outlawed
i hope its not "having to restart your game" bad. i need a good action rpg. i just beat darksiders 2 and it was awesome.
whats with this idea that nazis are the only people to ever commit genocide? i dunno about anyone else, but thats what they taught me in school. its ALMOST as if someone wanted to indoctrinate me. only later did i start to read about all the other ones. meanwhile africa as a whole is still choppin off clits and raping babies to cure aids
those good days add up too, ya know, just slower.
 the comments women write about this dude are one of the main reasons i started working out again. 
today is day 301 for me.. its strange to say,  but this last election cycle coincided with a major period of transformation in my life. theres something about pulling yourself up by the bootstraps that makes you come to terms with your own mental BS, not blaming people, not asking for handouts, and doing what is right no matter what people around you are saying. i knew i wasnt the only one. id venture a guess that almost all people who have had to come to terms with their problems or DIE are trump voters, or at the very least want nothing to do with what passes for "the left"
monorail?\n
are they muslim? because if they were muslim, you would be right
That is a bad idea. Once we sink to their level we're essentially no different than all the SJW libtards.
Ill even throw in Netherworld to sweeten the deal!
The deal is done guys
Add me C-Dog725
Crimson Aras + Adds for heatwave?
They're already doing enough to screw themselves up. If all these protests continue I don't expect the left to be in power for quite a while. We don't need to give them anything more to latch on to. \n\nJust let them shoot themselves, don't justify their insanity. 
Cert. White Aras for your crimsons?
Sorry dude I'm trying to trade for a mystery or hold on to them until after the C5 drops. 
I'm think im done with RL for a bit. It really stings to get sent back to square 1.
Sorry, meant to type Hexed in title, not Biomass. You can keep that grody decal to yourselves.
How much for the Cert heatwave?
This might be too much. But I'll give you a season 1 bronze crown. 
I have a small pile of stuff I'd trade you. 1 key, 2 C1s, 5C3s, Discos, cert X-Devil Snakeskin, Lightning, toon smoke, and Octane Distortion. I could also throw in some adds if you need. 
Ya. In hindsight I can see how dumb I was but he was offering a heatwave and 5 keys. 
I have 4 cc3s and 2 cc1s
Cert Turtle Type S for Discos?
Yo I'll trade you for that truckers hat if you want.
Lol, stav just told a story about how he probably stole 7000+ in food from some grocery store. I think I'll sleep fine knowing I pirated a podcast.
@C-Dog725
1 sad sapling.
Can we seriously do this please? I would personally put down 20$ if it meant we could tell maddox to get raped.
I think in this scenario the turtle would've lost. If it was a closer race the hare would never have thought he'd have the time to take a break, which ultimately gave the turtle the victory. If he'd never taken a break and instead just powered through it would be a victory for the hare. (Sorry I just cant let it go)
Of course I'm for arresting RIOTERS. I just think that we should follow the normal democratic processes instead of subverting it like the left is trying to do rn.
Just add me I'll be on for the next 15 mins
Nty, I'm really just looking for Discos. Good luck tho 
Yes it is. Ive seen it so many times on here.
Cc4?
Lol that's not the accepted rate on here bud.
"Evidence a mile long" what? No one can ever cite any real evidence. Give me ONE thing that ties Trump to put in in any negative way.

Surferbro9669 is a good man.
Explain this one. How so?
I think it's a bad move to include time prior to the article. That pretty much removes all hope of this getting passed. No senator is going to vote for  removing themselves from office. 
If you can get the keys for that disco I'll take you up on it
He's also offering 10 crates on top
Yo I'll take my first heatwave if you're trying to give it away. @C-Dog725

They've already been traded sorry
Have a bunch of CC3s if you'll trade for keys.
Crimson Ara 51s?
It's a major portion of the election, and it affected both sides. Romney and McCain lost because Obama was just more charismatic. Ted Cruz who was infinitely more qualified to be president lost to Trump because he has a weird face. It's a sad fact that it will always be there in the election.
Apparently the team didn't listen /u/cozmo23 
White Aras Cert.?
